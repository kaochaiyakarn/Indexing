overview gives overview architecture system developing 
system roughly divided main components analyser component provides syntactic analysis partial disambiguation newspaper text simplifier component subsequently adapts output analyser aid readability aphasic people 
analyser consists subcomponents lex syntactic simplifier simplifier lexical newspaper text analysed newspaper text analyser simplifier input output lexical tagger parser analyser morphological simplified newspaper text system architecture ical tagger morphological analyser parser 
simplifier component consists subcomponents lexical simplifier syntactic simplifier 
subcomponents system described briefly sections 
input output system intended marked text documents markings passed subcomponents system unchanged 
specifically input hypertext markup language html documents fetch automatically online version sunderland echo newspaper local daily newspaper city north east england 
analyser analyser enhanced extended version pre existing system robust domain independent syntactic parsing english unification grammar part speech pos punctuation labels coupled probabilistic lr parser 
currently online version newspaper accessible www sunderland com echo index htm 
system able compute analysis sentences substantial corpus general text containing number distinct genres carroll briscoe 
failures due requirement find root sentence able find fragments dialogue intend relax stipulation grammar learning techniques example osborne submitted dynamically improve coverage principled tractable manner 
system achieves accuracy comparable state art random sample coverage sentences system mean crossing bracket rate bracket recall precision respectively evaluated manually disambiguated analyses 
lexical tagger subcomponent analyser lexical tagger order hmm pos punctuation tag disambiguator assigns ranks tags word punctuation token sequences sentences 
tagger includes developed unknown word guesser accuracy currently devoting effort creating customised large lexicon covers larger proportion words newspaper text efficient disc access mechanism 
morphological analyser morphological analyser robust efficient tool finite state techniques performs inflectional analysis words text pos assignment tagger 
component enhanced version gate project cunningham wilks gaizauskas 
parser parser uses feature unification grammar pos punctuation labels assigning shallow phrase structure analyses tag networks lattices returned tagger briscoe carroll 
line compilation grammar improve run time parsing efficiency carroll parser able construct representation full set parses sentence time empirically quadratic sentence length 
parser uses probabilistic information acquired training corpora returns ranked analyses carroll briscoe briscoe carroll 
example structure output analyser headline sentence sunderland echo elderly couple hurt gas blast 
simplifier aphasic people may encounter problems reading 
devlin forthcoming shows problems lexical nature frequent words readily available syntactic ap elderly jj couple nn vp hurt vv pp ii gas nn blast nn example output analyser headline sentence nature particular constructions may pose serious difficulties understanding 
addition general aspects text constitute problems aphasic readers problems caused specifically newspaper text typical compact summary paragraph article 
sentence length problematic aphasic people newspapers tend include sentences words 
local papers average words 
common feature frequent compounds adjectives instance phrases mother jane smith 
house newspaper style books warn overuse passive newspapers want attract attention potential reader employ sentences bid build local today accepted council straightforward easier aphasic readers council today accepted bid build local 
syntactic simplifier aphasic people problems syntactic constructions deviate canonical subject verb object order 
example passive sentences boy kissed girl interchanging subject object results semantically acceptable sentence problematic 
despite presence syntactic cues ed aphasic readers difficulty understanding sentence 
order assist aphasic readers propose replace passive constructions active constructions 
syntactic simplifications significantly improve readability newspaper text include elimination multiply embedded prepositional relative phrases generally replacement longer sentences shorter ones 
process building rule syntactic simplifier convert passives split conjoined sentences extract embedded clauses 
simplifier utilise unification pattern matching phrase marker trees produced analyser operate iteratively repeatedly applying rules simplified trees forms reached simplified 
expected rule sets ordered possibly single shot rules may required feasibility unclear stage 
approach broadly similar proposed doran srinivas 
number possible problems challenges example maintenance text coherence cohesion aphasic opposed normal reader observed effect total length text increased longer sentences replaced multiple shorter ones 
lexical simplifier lexical simplifier builds reported devlin tait devlin forthcoming 
devlin simplifier feeds content words time analysed newspaper text wordnet lexical database miller 
word file created containing synonyms held wordnet entry 
simplifier reads file extracts percentage synonyms specified user depending level simplification required oxford psycholinguistic database quinlan kucera francis frequency synonym original word 
appropriate word highest frequency selected written output file newspaper text 
words isolation ambiguous 
syntactic analysis resolve ambiguity considering words part larger construction especially analyser incorporates statistical information 
disambiguation possible deep semantic analysis costly seriously compromise practicality system developing 
refrain elaborate analysis meaning text lexical simplification possibly change meaning 
believe practice turn problem observation frequent words candidates simplification specific meaning ambiguous 
evaluation perform experimental evaluation system field subjects aphasic people reading problems related vision 
furthermore ensure test people possess sufficient level comprehension restricting experiments people score sentence reading comprehension boston diagnostic aphasia examination kaplan 
purpose experiments newspaper text aphasic subject evaluating system aphasic people suffer visually related reading problems confound experimental results 
laptop computer 
experiments planned take place closely monitored supported setting probably aphasic person home 
assessment readability simplified text usability system observation interview 
described system assist aphasic readers currently developing combines stateof art natural language processing tools innovative research text simplification 
automatic linguistic analysis partial disambiguation newspaper text system applies syntactic lexical simplification techniques improve readability text 
system evaluated reading experiments aphasic people 
envisage results project aphasic individuals assist normal nonnative speakers access written english text restricted limited foreign language skills
