problem identifying stylistic features document considered literature literary analysis primarily purpose attribution classic works disputed authorship see surveys holmes 
carried area forensics bailey 
virtually early authorship attribution problem focused attempts isolate discriminators individual stylistic features largely invariant different passages author vary author author 
types discriminators considered including sentence length yule vocabulary richness yule frequencies selected words complicated measures 
particularly important example attempt combine information obtainable features seminal mosteller wallace uses features frequencies set selected content free function words conjunctions prepositions 
features proved successful applications convincingly shown particular features consistently effective wide range authorship attribution problems goldberg 
surely hope finding small set discriminators prove effective general problem categorization style 
modern learning text categorization methods overcome problem literary considering large set candidate features allowing data target documents drive selection features particular problem 
follows demonstrate combining modern computational linguistic technology machine learning techniques advantage style categorization 
algorithm characterizing textual style step characterize document terms large class stylistic features 
consider types features lexical pseudo syntactic 
lexical features simply frequency function words 
function words authorship attribution research mosteller wallace 
rationale frequency words presumably driven content expected remain invariant author different topics 
reasoning expect invariance classes similar documents 
example word appear frequently promotional literature word appear frequently word today appear frequently news items 
list function words considerable previous studies fewer 
addition function words different set features directly encode information syntactic structure text 
syntactic structure expected revealing simple words counts argued baayen 

idea particular document classes favor certain syntactic constructions 
previous syntactic features baayen automated parsing input texts 
pointed time consuming unreliable procedure required method capturing underlying syntactic structures efficient reliable fashion 
adopt simple robust approach tag word text part speech pos brill rulebased part speech tagger brill uses tagset brown corpus 
features consider pos trigrams 
trigrams large encode useful syntactic information small computationally 
example frequent trigram personal pronoun tense verb verb gerund indicative particular possibly syntactic style 
possible trigrams consider features trigrams appear percent documents corpus 
noted exclude consideration features prove useful 
example determining particular passage written arthur doyle perfectly reasonable check frequency appearance say sherlock 
larger picture features deceptive

careful review rules produced ripper adds insight meaning results 
consider example rules distinguishing times news stories daily news stories function words 
today yesterday 

default 
numbers parentheses rule reflect number documents correctly incorrectly rule 
error rate test documents 
picture emerges relatively small number signature features decisively mark document belonging particular collection 
difficulties arise document signature features 
consider signature features turn 
word today signature feature times news stories word yesterday signature feature daily news stories 
times stories daily news stories contain words today yesterday respectively reverse holds stories 
similarly interesting signature features pos triples 
signature triple magazine quote verb proper noun 
triple appears newspaper articles appears articles 
indicates uses tense verbs newspapers past tense verb 
signature triple times news determiner proper noun gore previously scheduled stops appearances president wednesday midwest lend energetic support 
reflects fact times uses complex sentence structure 
results table simply reflect pervasiveness various signature features 
news stories newspapers easily distinguished sources respective certain words easily distinguished distinctive syntax 
immediate classification task considered difficult isolate features reliably classes documents classes methods inconclusive 
discussion introduced problem style text categorization 
problem subsumes problem authorship attribution goes broad range applications information retrieval especially encountered attempts effectively navigate world wide web 
definitely progress experimentation required
