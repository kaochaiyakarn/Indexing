astronomy community collects statistics publication field tracking changes measures length general productivity institutional productivity 
traditionally statistics gathered hand necessarily small subset available documents 
collaborating astronomers interested automatically gathering information ads database data source 
automatically gathering statistics electronic documents allowed larger fraction documents considered new challenges 
example relatively simple compute statistics number papers journal calendar year statistics involving authors affiliations difficult 
determine papers written individual institution able reliably identify individual institution

reduction number distinct affiliations lexical cleanup approaches format may appear different affiliation variants resolving difference may resolve multiple variants 
lexical cleanup steps described include expanding abbreviations acronyms removing additional information included postal addresses 
initial step identification acronyms abbreviations items represent 
simple rules help identify potential abbreviations acronyms string
