combination multiple searches joseph shaw edward fox department computer science virginia tech blacksburg va trec project virginia tech focused methods combining evidence multiple retrieval runs queries improve retrieval performance single retrieval method query 
largest improvements result combination retrieval paradigms multiple similar queries 
overview primary focus experiments virginia tech involved methods combining results various divergent search schemes document collections 
performing trec ad hoc retrieval experiments provided test collections results vector norm queries considered estimating similarity document individual collection 
results collection merged create single final set documents user 
trec experiments built trec experiments focused determining improvements combination derived evaluating different combination methods 
index creation section outlines indexing done document collections provided nist 
individual collections indexed separately document vector files limitations disk space prohibited inverted files creation single combined document vector file 
processing performed decstation mb ram release smart information retrieval system enhancements previous experiments new modification trec experiments 
index files created source text process 
source document text provided nist passed convert sgml format proper format version smart 
extraneous sections documents filtered point 
text sections documents various headline title summary sections collections indexed sections ignored 
subsections text fields existed considered part text field subsection delimiters simply removed 
resulting filtered text tokenized words deleted standard word list provided smart plural removal stemming performed remaining non noise words included term dictionary occurrence frequencies 
term dictionary unique identification number 
document vector file created indexing contains document unique id vector term ids term weights 
smart ann weighting scheme defined term tf proved effective trec experiments evaluate queries trec results

retrieval queries queries created researcher topic descriptions provided nist

norm queries written complex boolean expressions operators

individual retrieval runs sets vector queries evaluated standard cosine correlation similarity method implemented smart 
smart ann weighting scheme norm queries vector queries simplify merging retrieval results various collections 
resulting similarity values collection statistics differed collection 
retrieval results collections combined simply merging results solely table summary individual runs

retrieval runs term weights collection statistics inverse document frequency similarity values directly comparable collections 
norm queries evaluated different smart ann weighting scheme specific norm experiments described 
individual runs summarized table equivalent trec runs exceptions query construction noted 
combination retrieval runs trec experiments concentrated methods combining runs similarity values document query runs 
additionally combining similarities retrieval time advantage extra evidence combining separate results files similarity document run available just similarities top documents run 
explored methods combining individual similarity values simply combining values linear fashion summing similarity values worked better trying select similarity value 
method combination called comb sum trec report exclusively trec experiments 
trec results procedure described cial trec ad hoc results 
submitted sets results run labeled vtc combsum method combine individual runs official trec results run labeled vtc combined short vector query query evaluated value 
official results reported column table rows labeled runs

trec vtc run combining runs performed significantly better best individual runs fact performed better combination runs collections 
query basis vtc run performed better best component runs topics 
difference performance combination runs significant 
experiments involving possible combinations individual runs reported table reveals interesting trends 
combining type runs vector queries queries shows little improvement individual runs performs worse best runs instances 
combining vector queries queries shows improvement 
indicates primary source improvements seen combination runs submitted trec derives combination retrieval paradigms simply multiple queries 
may due similarity inherent queries combining queries composed widely different sets query terms may result significant improvements 
single set query terms possible achieve significant improvements combining different retrieval paradigms
