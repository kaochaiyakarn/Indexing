generic framework dialogue game implementation 
irit rue toulouse cedex france fabrice fr authors proposed dialogue games structure model conventions language exist dialogue interactions 
dialogue games allow speakers dialogue accordance rules 
main idea prohibit sequences moves previous moves manner dialogue grammar players mental states 
unfortunately model built formalism designed specific type interaction concerned local coherence purpose determine common requirements models propose generic framework dialogue game implementation allowing games part larger structure reflecting global coherence dialogue 
term language game initially goes back wittgenstein proposed wittgenstein see language rule governed activity 
growing interest game theory offer new perspectives notion 
term dialogue game wittgenstein game theory 
understand various approaches term 
noted burton brna approaches divided 
approach initiated levin moore mann introduces dialogue games bilateral structures containing actions players specific interactions kind shared scripts 
instance helping game expected explain problem helper expected propose solution 
steps game cognitive material acts 
main drawback approach lack flexibility structure consisting list fixed actions 
quite similar approach brown uses notion recovery path account unexpected actions 
despite interesting results see instance account speech acts christophe philippe muller fruitful comments 
approaches obsolete respect especially plans shared participants dialogue grosz sidner 
slightly modified shared plans behavior games include conventional actions logically necessary constitute conventional habitual part interaction 
combines conventional component dialogue games shared plans

call category moves dialogue moves define turn game interval dialogue moves 
dialogue moves played alternately speaker play dialogue move called active player 
dialogue moves modify cognitive context game addition facts concerned board

imagine moves forces apply logical rule board 
goals intention explicitly represented game players goal play game game try achieve state answer initial question mutually believed dc player trying prove trying prove goals captured model structure game 
restrict information exchange dialogue goals merely mental state players want achieve
