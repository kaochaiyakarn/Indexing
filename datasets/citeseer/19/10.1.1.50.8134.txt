restrict attention approach somewhat general 
gate mean element boolean circuit describe particular universal plan 
assume gate inputs single output note gate possible input combinations possible gates 
expression form encoded having signal corresponding drive output corresponding passing signal inverter having drive output corresponding suppose domain includes binary sensors examine current situation primitive actions planner take 
circuit size mean arbitrary collection gates connected arbitrary ways outputs sensors actuators correspond decisions take primitive actions 
restriction place circuit outputs connected 
assumptions sensors 
independent combination sensor readings corresponds possible situation second information sensors sufficient determine action robot take 
assumptions combination allow assume distinct situations universal plan specify action 
proposition distinct universal plans 
distinct circuits size proof 
just matter counting 
number functions universal plans set size set situations set size set possible combinations actions taken describe circuit consisting gates specify gate possible types input signals inputs gate actuators signals drives gate output sensor signal 
proposition number gates expected needed order describe universal plan domain sensors order proof 
simply result solving words number gates needed order describe universal plan general grow exponentially size domain 
similar arguments schoppers decision tree formulation 
note proposition holds independent value number primitive actions agent take 
appear impractical construct circuit exactly captures original universal plan construct describes alternative universal plan takes action approximately described robot moves inches situation 
see general impractical lump actions single circuit simply trying tell need act act need gates decision 
note allowing feedback loops assume circuit responds effectively instantly inputs 
reasonable circuit contain explicitly timedependent elements latches 
universal plans don matter schoppers rosenschein realize intention capturing entire universal plan needed act domain argue universal plan reason described far fewer gates expect average 
certainly possible principle various domain sensors sensing things take action 
rosenschein kaelbling just 
action component proposed architecture intelligent agents expected contain exact description universal plan perception component explicitly allows arbitrary manipulations agent primitive sensory inputs 
manipulations involve symbolic computations planning turning primitive inputs things take action 
schoppers hand assumes possible encode universal plan changing sensory inputs 
simple domains blocks world examples considered assumption turns valid available sensors provide information nearly needed determine action take 
surprising example sensor telling particular block clear providing information turned action decision minimum effort 
general things simple 
consider blocks world problem stacking blocks spell 
reason problem difficult universal planners blocks world blocks excess 
possible situations need specify actions impractical available sensors give useful information simply block labelled clear 
nilsson managed construct universal plan achieving goal introducing new sensors designed specifically problem 
specifically nilsson assumes existence sensors determine primitives constructed far block moved order eventually clear top block 
sensors hardly surprising nilsson construct universal plan goal question 
complex examples worse 
plan tactical combination win chess game going attack queen ll go ll respond ll able 
opponent won move queen 
human player need consider possibility simply assume able win game queen captured 
universal planner take need plan minute detail deal combination moves bad opponent 
addition move selected chess position note similar perceptual modifications allowed rosenschein kaelbling 
different selected nearby position pieces displaced square changed color reason believe possible express universal plan problem reasonable number gates decision nodes 
planning situations 
general am extremely pessimistic reasons describe shortly 
point pessimism schoppers tacitly making extremely strong claim planning problems encountered autonomous agents type universal plans represented 
claim needs defended

described blocks world domain baby wandering occasionally blocks relocating 
unpredictable domain argued important planned unexpected contingencies advance 
suppose trying get schoppers blocks top particular location 
get block set getting second block baby moves 
put second block get block back belongs go back second block 
unfortunately baby moves block 

put second block go back block 

actuality fairly novel 
try carry second block bring blocks target location simultaneously 
take second block target location hoping baby wouldn move 
find baby lock bathroom moved blocks 
point decision complex 
decide depends subtle ways values sensors just indicating blocks clear

agre chapman drummond appear general agreement view general impossible describe universal plan exact detail discuss consequences section

approximate universal plans exact universal plans discussed section agre chapman drummond assume agents approximate universal plans suggest suboptimal actions 
agre chapman argue suitable approach autonomous agent perform tasks playing video game 
entirely reasonable 
advantage approximate universal plans allow agents react extremely quickly surroundings disadvantage inflexibility extremely difficult agent plan expend limited resources order improve performance 
tasks fair choice 
tasks expects agent cognitive abilities improve performance approximate universal plan general overly restrictive 
ability enhance performance expending additional mental resources reasonable definition distinction cognitive behavior 
nilsson suggests difficulty overcome having actions suggested particular universal plan plan 
clearly way problem nilsson doing reducing universal plan case particular data structure calls action net representation technique conditional plans known agent runtime 
done contribution nilsson evaluated light 
action nets addressing data compaction problem opposed previously recognized issues planning reasoning action 
nilsson needs sharp arguments effect 
action nets provide compact representations precompiled plans available autonomous agent 
important issue 
words nilsson convince agent precompiled plans need compacted addressing issue comparable importance solving existing problems planning developing computationally viable descriptions action particular domain inverting descriptions construct plan acting precompiled plan applied 
unfortunately result direction due schoppers indicates decision tree description reduce amount time needed find precompiled plan assigned situation agent finds 
large savings addition principal cost deciding arbitrary situation finding situation table precompiled plans deciding plan available 
summary principal point impractical agent precompute response situation find 
argued attempt argue impractical plan reasonably contingencies vaguely ones 
situation expect replan sufficiently unexpected situation arises expect agent abilities permanently limited design decisions approximate universal plan constructed
