give brief description components 

speech recognition system recognition system large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system described 
system uses acoustic models units context dependent tying 
instances context dependent sub phone classes identified growing decision tree available training data specifying terminal nodes tree relevant instances classes 
acoustic feature vectors characterize training data leaves modeled mixture gaussian pdf diagonal covariance matrices 
leaf decision tree modeled state hidden markov model self loop forward transition 
ibm system expresses output distributions state transitions terms rank leaf terms feature vector mixture gaussian pdf modeling training data leaf 
rank leaf obtained computing log likelihood acoustic vector model leaf ranking leaves basis log likelihoods

information retrieval system information retrieval system typically works phases document indexing phase matching phase 
document indexing phase document collection processed yield document description known stands place retrieval 
system processing involves part speech tagging text followed morphological analysis text followed removal function words standard word list 
contrast simple stemming filtering current systems 
morphological analysis form linguistic signal processing great utility natural language processing 
instance morphological analysis decompositions verbs decomposed units designating person tense mood verb plus root verb 
similarly nouns decomposed roots possibly tag indicating plural form 
written request processed identical fashion yield query 
example request security arrangements involving international peace 
query obtained processing done 
security arrangement involve international peace general retrieval system uses pass approach 
sdr evaluation employed just pass 
pass query matching score computed document documents ranked score 
scoring function simply weighting scheme takes account number times query term grams general occurs document normalized respect length document 
normalization essential remove bias longer documents 
scoring function favors terms specific document rare significant documents 
version okapi formula computing matching score document query ff ff idf kth term query number terms query counts kth term query document respectively markers oov words included included perplexity computation 
length document average length documents collection idf inverse document frequency term idf log gamma total number documents number documents contain term inverse document frequency term favors terms rare documents 
linear combination unigram bigram scores pass weights respectively 
unigrams ff ff bigrams ff ff 
second pass re rank documents training probabilistic relevance model documents top ranked documents pass training data

evaluation corpus audio indexing evaluation corpus consists approximately hours radio news broadcasts voice america covering time period may june 
day broadcasts starting different hour spaced roughly hours apart downloaded internet site 
done ensure broadcasts similar content ensure collection different speakers 
entire collection main speakers male female anchors speakers correspondents interviewees contributing short segments 
broadcast typically mins long begins signature announcement followed signature music 
typical news bulletin usually consists news stories includes reports correspondents telephone line brief interviews foreign speakers english 
entire speech collection recognized large vocabulary speech recognizer produce transcripts time alignments word transcripts 
standard information retrieval scenario text collection segmented documents document usually discussing specific topic story story segmentation automatically available application 
need scheme segment transcripts stories 
method apply standard topic identification schemes automatically segment text topics simplistic solution problem break transcript overlapping segments fixed number words treat segment separate document 
adopt approach experiment words document resulting documents collection

open vocabulary system limitation current approach finite coverage vocabulary speech recognizer words proper nouns abbreviations important information retrieval standpoint missing vocabulary recognized transcripts 
method overcome limitation complement speech recognizer vocabulary oov words 
approach practical ability detect spoken number documents retrieved pass 
second pass precision vs number retrieved documents second pass 
words large amounts speech speeds times faster real time 
developed novel algorithm gives speed retrieval flexibility able search word 
accomplish adopting step procedure preprocessing step stage search strategy 
preprocessing step convert speech waveform representation consisting table phone ngrams times occurs high likelihood 
representation allows search speech efficiently 
stage search consists phone ngram lookup narrow time intervals word uttered detailed acoustic match time intervals decide accurately word uttered time interval
