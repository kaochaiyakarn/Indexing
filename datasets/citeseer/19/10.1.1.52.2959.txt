article describes negotiating agents approach telecommunications platform 
negotiation approach resolve conflicts features user different users 
theory approach discussed briefly 
methods implementing approach methods defining features terms negotiating agents approach order resolve conflicts features 
rapid change telecommunications industry increases complexity building telecommunications services 
complexity arises feature interaction problem 
features interact user understand behavior features combination features users may affect features 
similarly service provider determine combinations features behave including combinations features providers features 
need understand features combination individually limits ability users network ability providers add 
propose approach class features feature interactions avoids need understand features combination 
approach provides elegant mechanism detecting resolving feature interactions 
assume standard platform underlying services telecommunications network offering collection operations users network 
case existing networks various groups working standardize platform 
platform define kinds features 
kind feature technology feature individual operation platform provides 
new technology feature created creating new operation platform 
imagine features usually correspond new technology new equipment provided network example voice activated dialing voice recognition technology 
second kind feature policy feature constraint set operations user provider willing perform initiating modifying call 
example user may say customer equipment connected particular number service provider may say service provided enumerated list subscribers 
problem interactions technology features quite different problem interactions policy features 
address problem interactions policy features henceforth term feature refers policy feature 
single party feature interaction occurs possible satisfy constraints single subscriber 
multi party feature interaction occurs possible satisfy constraints parties attempted call 
today features modify process call setup 
correct functioning feature depends assumptions process works 
features modify process interaction features inevitable 
interaction desirable block calling number delivery prevents calling number delivery providing originator number terminating party undesirable call forwarding allows calls set call screening features prevent 
approach problem feature interactions necessary describe intended effect feature call order distinguish desirable undesirable interactions 
approach enable users providers involved call specify directly constraints calls accept having embody constraints features hard understand hard 
assume constraints expressed terms operations user provider willing unwilling perform 
resolve conflicts constraints different users provide mechanism negotiate determine set operations initiate modify call 
negotiation process provides automated method detecting resolving policy feature interactions run time 
negotiation method guarantees policies intentions various entities respected calls set possible 
important consequence negotiation autonomy different users providers preserved 
claim negotiation provides additional advantages users service providers 
body claims 
ffl single party feature interactions automatically detected 
resolution interactions user service provider 
ffl multi party feature interactions automatically detected resolved runtime 
ffl user subscriber specify individual policy involving calls 
ffl calls set violating policy set 
ffl unanticipated feature interactions due faulty implementation system failures involving negotiation mechanism detected result violation policy 
ffl need aware policy features belonging particular need know combinations policy features setting particular call 
section examples features interactions conventional methods automatic feature interaction detection problematic 
section describe incorporate paradigm negotiation arbitrary extensible object oriented platform telecommunications 
negotiation mechanism detail review section 
describe negotiation implemented platform touring machine tm platform 
section discuss generic ain cs features designed paradigm 
section summarize advantages discuss remaining research issues 
example feature interactions features section subvert intention user features 
kind interference appears require user service know sense features may encountered 
furthermore appears order resolve interaction favor feature 
offers alternative knowing features favoring 
examples illustrate basic idea approach 
example feature subvert intended purpose feature calling number delivery provides number originating subscriber terminating subscriber 
feature interact number feature 
depends subscriber reason subscribing number 
subscriber doesn want number known calling number delivery intentions 
example resolution discussed detail tm touring machine trademark bellcore 

assume subscriber number willing identify provide number subscriber calling number delivery wants know identity calling party 
proposal satisfy intentions parties call deliver name number 
order illustrate application negotiation fully second example raises similar issues 
suppose user terminating key code protection feature protects line requiring caller enter user defined key call offered line 
consider interaction call forwarding cf 
suppose subscriber call forwarding called forwarded calls line called subscriber called terminating key code protection 
call forwarded caller asked enter key may know 
know key told line call forwarded 
appropriate resolution interaction requires knowing intentions subscribers activated features 
services mentioned number different purposes 
select just purposes feature sake example 
purpose call forwarding sure calls subscriber number home phone reach 
second redirect calls appropriately secretary voice mail 
similarly purpose terminating key code protection sure authorized users put line 
words protects line unauthorized callers 
purpose permit subscriber select callers talk 
case protects subscriber random callers 
considering purposes suppose friend calling forwarded calls argue correct resolution interaction require key purpose key protect line 
purpose key protect subscriber key required different subscriber object call 
hand forwarded calls wants handle calls key required protects subscriber line 
cases key required see case possible satisfy goals subscribers complete call requiring key 
approach observation 
typically particular implementation feature represent ultimate intention user merely way achieve user intentions 
exist alternative ways achieve intentions 
alternatives provide room negotiation 
explore alternatives necessary user agent receiving request set call unacceptable user recognize intention request derive intention alternative possibly acceptable ways achieve 
user informed explicitly intentions users user may able speculate intention information received request 
automate process recognizing intentions building hierarchy possible goals top primitive system operations 
subscriber willing agree proposed set operations initiate modify call agent subscriber uses hierarchy infer goal intended caller checks see alternative way achieve goal 
alternative rejecting call outright subscriber offer alternative 
implementing negotiation part telecommunications system negotiating system negotiates collection operations perform platform 
describe levels telecommunications system uses negotiation platform negotiating objects user interface 
platform mechanism negotiating assumes call initiation modification described collection operations determine form call 
policy features technology features related operations technology features determine operations available policy features determine operations system user willing 
order add features rapidly easily including new operations operations provided extensible objectoriented platform telecommunications 
believe issues interaction technology features addressed platforms 
policy features determine operations system user willing execute collection operations proposed system user decide system users providers asked authorize operations require instantiation operation arguments determine system users providers authorize operation 
user may want authorize operation affects user example connecting equipment owns network resources billing network resources 
provider may want authorize operations making providers resources 
require collection system users providers authorize collection operations union sets agents agent station station user user network station user agent negotiator user agent station agent network logical structure negotiating system telecommunications 
authorizing users providers individual operations 
telecommunications system user creates proposal initiating modifying call partially ordered set operations provided platform 
partial order refers order execution operations 
set operations sent negotiating system returns possibly different set operations executed 
system users providers required approved operations returned collection operations 
agents negotiator negotiating system works behalf entities policies restricting collections operations willing perform 
includes agent objects represent various entities system try carry policies negotiators help agents reach agreement 
illustrates interrelationships negotiating system telecommunications 
entities include system users local equipment telephones workstations public network 
potential entities include information providers software service providers various communications providers 
agent object assigned entity 
functions agent produce proposals initiate modify call evaluate proposals agents possibly generating counter proposals 
proposals specify desired operations calls 
proposal acceptable entity agent constructs counter proposal 
section describe mechanism evaluating generating counter proposals 
distinguish quite different organisations negotiation direct negotiation 
case agents negotiate directly assistance mediator 
indirect negotiation 
dedicated entity recognize agents approve proposal route proposals counter proposals appropriate agents 
call entity negotiator 
entity monitor progress negotiation session determine agreement reached enter proposals negotiation process proven widely acceptable previous sessions 
arbitrated negotiation 
arbitrator takes complete script agent sole responsibility finding resolution conflict 
arbitrated negotiation agents don need generate evaluate proposals 
negotiator object indirect negotiation agents 
reasons opt organisation 
advantages indirect negotiation arbitration direct negotiation 

contrast direct negotiation separate negotiator monitor negotiation process sure actual progress non terminating sequence proposals counter proposals created 

mediator negotiator arbitrator communication easier include new agents communicate new agents 

negotiator knowledge acquired monitoring previous negotiation sessions propose solutions 

different mediators different situations providing benefits specialization 
instance envision smart dumb negotiators provide support expensive 

mediator act honest broker prepares proposals handled agreement equally parties 
primary advantage indirect negotiation arbitration generally applicable 
cases including telecommunications systems parties negotiation may want share preferences third party 
phone seen trusted party current increase competition phone companies candidates role 
reason prefer negotiator arbitrator negotiator possible agents distinguish agents improve results smarter parties 
may seen thing bad thing 
general problem malevolent agents trying take advantage system entities addressed 
appears arbitrated negotiation computationally expensive indirect negotiation relevant information locally available arbitrator 
arbitrated negotiation approach requires information sent arbitrator case indirect negotiation information sent entity appears pertinent resolving particular conflict 
suggests arbitrated negotiation expensive terms communication overhead 
may address benefits drawbacks different methods detail 
concentrate case indirect negotiation 
user interface system users providers need access kinds functionality expressing constraints sets operations agree submitting proposals 
functionality provisioning 
user defines policy part service 
second functionality initiates call set modification 
constraint language provided describe collections operations allowed states 
constraints expressed logic language avoid intractability chosen simple language small collection user goals 
user specifies acceptability goals 
section describe acceptability proposal inferred acceptability goals 
language entity able specify finite set states enter enumerate instantiated goals acceptable unacceptable state specify operations trigger transition state 
example suppose platform offers operations connect 
user define states busy idle say connect acceptable idle state acceptable busy state 
operation connect triggers transition idle busy state triggers transition busy state idle state 
user wants initiate modify call simply needs select goal 
negotiating system find way meeting goal 
negotiation mechanism description negotiation mechanism 
description negotiation mechanism uses example terminating key call protection call forwarding preceding section 
example show process generating evaluating proposals counter proposals formalized automated 
process uses goal hierarchy definition acceptable proposals algorithms determining acceptability proposals generating

goal hierarchy basis negotiation goal hierarchy lowest level basic goals operations platform 
higher level goals correspond possible goals intentions user 
examples basic goals containing goal hierarchy example get key connect station 
operation get key asks user enter key station succeeds responds correct key 
operation connect station connects stations behalf users new goals formed combining goals ways 
goal call abstraction goals connect station 
goal call denotes call users connect station denotes connection stations user station user station abstraction relation connect station connect user uninstantiated parameters short hand interpreted follows assignment values say parameters goal connect user abstraction goals connect station assignment values parameters returning goal hierarchy goal call achieved connect station key station achieved value goal abstraction second goal say second goal specialization 
achieving specialization goal implies achieving goal 
define composition relation goals 
example goal key connect composed goals get key 
composite goal achieved component goals subgoals achieved 
types relationships build hierarchy illustrated 
nodes represent goals broken lines represent abstraction relationships solid lines represent composition relationships 
goal needs achieved goal achieved achieving specializations goal achieving composite subgoals 
abstraction composition relations define different ways goal achieved 
notions abstraction composition define call get key key connect connect connect goal hierarchy example negotiation process 
specification goal 
specification goal derived recursively replacing goal specializations composite goal set components 
home stand location home usual station user example station home home specification goal call 
means way call set connection home station home station specification goal call station means way call connect stations intended station station discuss handle section

section defines acceptable proposal acceptability specification proposal acceptable agent entity agent represents subscriber agree 
specification unacceptable entity agree 
specification acceptable unacceptable agent 
possibly specifications goal subscriber required record acceptability goals subset specifications acceptability specifications 
goal marked acceptable unacceptable left unmarked 
goal unmarked call goal indeterminate 
acceptability specifications derived acceptability goals achieve number rules described 
specifications acceptable goal acceptable 
means marking goal acceptable subscriber indicates matter goal achieved acceptable 
analogously specification unacceptable goal acceptable 
goal marking may acceptable unacceptable specifications

similarly second heuristic rule states composite goal acceptable unacceptable component goal unacceptable assume composite goal unacceptable 
acceptability marking goal hierarchy complete repeatedly inference rules heuristic rules application rules result changes markings 
completing marking general diminish searching needed determining applicability received proposals 
outline negotiation process negotiation process consists number separate tasks specification policies generating proposals determining acceptability proposals generating 
illustrate example negotiation proceed definitions previous section 
specification policies 
task agents negotiation mechanism reach agreements achieve short term goals meet long term constraints policies 
example short term goal set call 
long term constraints specified policies 
policy user subscribes line accessed entering correct key 
policies specified separately particular negotiation process marking agent goal hierarchy labels acceptable unacceptable

terminating key code protection set key screen calls knowing key 
generating proposal 
negotiation process initiated goal identified needs achieved subscriber indicates wants call 
goal may acceptable assuming unacceptable acceptable specification goal exist 
hierarchy searched find acceptable specification goal 
example specification call acceptable suppose agent sends initial proposal 
determining acceptability 
proposal counter proposal received agent decide acceptable 
agent agree alternative acceptable receiving agent needs generated 
acceptability determined searching hierarchy 
proposal specification acceptable goal proposal acceptable 
specification unacceptable goal proposal clearly unacceptable 
goals achieved proposal acceptable unacceptable proposal acceptable 
intuitively proposal subdivided parts achieves acceptable goal proposal acceptable 
proposal acceptable counter proposal generated acceptable ones explored 
illustrates proposals acceptable 

proposal acceptable unacceptable specifications station home home acceptable suppose sends specification 

counter proposal connect station home home achieve goal acceptable achieves goal acceptable unacceptable specifications acceptable 
agent look alternative specification goal acceptable 
proposal fget key home connect station home home acceptable acceptable generating counter proposal 
proposal acceptable need find alternative 
distinguish cases 
proposal may acceptable detailed specification instance proposal acceptable home home 
proposal may achieve goal unacceptable possibly unacceptable goal abstraction unacceptable goal acceptable specification 
goal home home unacceptable abstraction call acceptable specification 

cases hold find solution changing acceptability markings agents 
require relaxing constraints involved agents 
interesting question requiring research 
iterative generation proposals counter proposals constitutes search process goal hierarchy find specification achieves original goal agent initiated negotiation acceptable involved parties 
negotiation process terminates proposal parties exhausted possibilities generating counter proposals
