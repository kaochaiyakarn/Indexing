meta rule mining process meta rule mining component process 
typical meta rule extraction process consists steps abraham roddick 
rule set generation 
step select mine individual snapshots collect associated rules separate rule sets timestamped identification 
rules generated commonly rule type hierarchies background knowledge including possible generalisation thresholds ensure full compatibility resulting rule set layers 
input preparation

meta rule set base generation 
separation algorithm takes rule set layers input compares produces categories meta rule set base new retired unchanged changed rules may null 
processing categories 
meta rule mining process concluded individually processing meta rule set base category derive general characterisations contents possibly selected new expired categories 
step constitutes second level abstraction described term meta rule 
applying meta rules different domains previous section concentrated extracting meta rules number rule sets compiled time stamped data layers 
section demonstrate process providing specific example discuss modifications original concept accommodate incremental update meta rule set data eventually gets refreshed 
shall extend example lu han ooi temperature data generalised regions british columbia canada 
spatially distributed data collection points allocated regions obtained conceptual hierarchy ascension generalisation thresholds

north central mild north central mild north central mild 
south west moderate table generalised region temperatures region temperature data values averaged generalised higherlevel temperature concepts 
resulting table contains region temperature pairs values north west mild mid central hot see table

area temperature north central mild north central mild north central mild area old temperature new temperature mid central hot warm mid east warm moderate mid west moderate warm south central mild cool south east warm cool south west moderate cool table unchanged changed generalised temperatures example step stage merge split algorithm region description constant part rules temperature concept difference measure 
required conceptual hierarchies generalisation thresholds regions ensures remain data layers 
correspondence regions tables 
new expired rule categories 
unchanged category contains region temperature pairs table temperature concept sets 
mid west mild changed category holds region old temperature new temperature triplets mid east hot moderately hot see table total number entries groups number existing generalised regions 
final step meta rule mining process describes contents categories 
unchanged case climbing spatial conceptual hierarchy may merge adjoining regions 
may done temperatures different merged regions 
case resulting meta rule may state temperature north region remained surveys 
database represented region temperature set pair north mild moderately cold 
notice constancy temperature implied membership appropriate meta rule set base category explicitly stated 
furthermore temperature set contains single entry resulting meta rule specific temperature north remained mild 
similar results achieved regions changed category 
merging may immediately produce descriptions temperature changed south 
investigating direction change may enhance 
purpose rules may applied old temperature new temperature pairs replacing concepts moderate increase steep decline associated region producing rules mid east experienced moderate temperature decrease case example triplet 
furthermore regions may merged set change concepts similar fashion unchanged case applying restriction direction change 
may produce database entry south moderate decrease steep decrease interpreted temperature decreased south change values generalised 
incremental maintenance discussed generating meta rules snapshot data 
database purpose need snapshot model snapshots taken continuously changing databases certain time points mined 
circumstances rules generated need preserved meta mining may need store earlier versions database 
certain database types transaction databases example allow limited set operations insertion new records reversal existing records 
relatively easy keep track modifications database 
clearly contents change may rules implied data 
order adjust rules reflect database contents time rule generation algorithm simply run 
presents number questions 
firstly run rule generation algorithm 
done new insertion wait certain threshold reached 
secondly necessary re run algorithm data set relatively small number records may inserted small number compared total number records 
questions addressed cheung 

rule maintenance algorithm focuses contents newly inserted data effects existing rules reduces processing requirements dramatically

addition describing incremental mining algorithms question appropriate initiate maintenance process received attention lee cheung 
discuss benefits maintaining meta rules 
points investigated include possibility utilising earlier results develop new techniques maintain meta rules possibility maintaining meta rules level happen 
maintenance restricted incremental updates underlying rules meta rules incrementally maintained 
possible maintain meta rules viable useful method

initially appears incremental updates input rule sets option snapshots taken database difference snapshots determines effectiveness incremental algorithms 
extensively studied association rules transaction databases deletions insertions allowed cheung 
cheung lee kao modification existing record treated deletion followed insertion 
shown long changes data sets exceed certain limit incremental updating works faster re running existing extraction algorithms

contrasts changes occur data rules time instance 
superscript expired denote data rules exist earlier sets ones

additional tasks incremental meta rule maintenance handling changed rules rule set 
aim maintaining rules dynamically changing data bring rules describing data date

meta rules hand describe events environment selected time periods

meta rules implicitly rule sets generate order provide time frame rules valid

data rules superscripts expired subscripts data rule set time unchanged data rule set time new changed changing data rule sets illustrates example rule sets meta rule sets generated 
suppose previously compiled rule sets new generated 
new sets meta rules generated new rule set previous ones 
previous sets add new new meta rule sets mi extracted 
scenarios exist creating meta rule sets 
extract meta rule set new immediately preceding rule sets 
mn previous meta information available process meaning incremental procedures employed meta level full extraction needs performed 
kind meta mining advantage gained production rn rn incremental rule maintenance 

extract meta rule set new older rule sets mi cases meta rule set exist starting rule set ri old rule set rn may possible contents production time rule meta rule sets observation scenario presumes previous meta rule sets available 
may case depends mining strategy employed meta miner 
possible preference meta rules mined elected starting rule set say current 
new meta rule set generated time current rule set updated 
case scenario applies meta rule set starting rule set preceding available example new rule set extracting meta rule set available 
problems arise addition simplified meta mining technique employ time windowing approach 
time windowing approach incremental rule updates initially proposed 
roddick 
purpose discard old data generation current rule set ensuring contents closely represent presently prevailing regularities environment 
addition incremental updating process viewed improvement earlier cheung 
highlight need statistically significant amounts data 
time windowing approach retains important aspect maintains old data longer contribute current rules 
wish follow similar approach producing meta rule sets 
longer keep meta rules span long period time 
addition applying time windowing may request justify meta rule update appropriately significant change newly generated rule set previous 
example meta rule set mij exists little change observed rule sets rj current successor rj little advantage gained extracting mi user defined thresholds may control process 
instance delta file kept store rules changed meta rule update threshold percentage changed rules compared total number rules exceed value reached trigger meta rule update
