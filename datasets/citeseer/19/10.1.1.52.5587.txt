information retrieval systems stopword lists stemming algorithms 
recognizing singular plural nouns verb forms negation prepositions produce dramatically different text classification results 
results text classification experiments compare relevancy signatures local linguistic context corresponding indexing terms 
different domains relevancy signatures produced better results simple indexing terms 
experiments suggest stopword lists stemming algorithms may remove conflate words create effective indexing terms 
information retrieval systems stopword list prevent common words indexing terms 
highly frequent words determiners prepositions considered content words appear virtually document 
stopword lists universally accepted necessary part information retrieval system 
example consider quote information retrieval textbook recognized earliest days information retrieval luhn frequently occurring words english worthless indexing terms 
frakes baeza yates information retrieval systems stemming algorithm conflate morphologically related words single indexing term 
motivation stemming algorithms improve recall generalizing morphological variants 
stemming algorithms commonly experiments determine effectiveness produced mixed results see harman krovetz 
benefit stopword lists stemming algorithms significantly reduce storage requirements inverted files 
price 
types words removed stopword lists merged stemming algorithms play important role making certain domain discriminations 
example similar expressions containing different prepositions auxiliary verbs behave differently 
singular plural nouns produce dramatically different text classification results 
describe text classification algorithm uses linguistic expressions called relevancy signatures classify texts 
results text classification experiments domains show similar signatures produce substantially different classification results 
discuss implications results information retrieval systems 
relevancy signatures relevancy signatures represent linguistic expressions classify texts specific domain topic 
linguistic expressions extracted texts automatically information extraction system called circus 
section gives brief information extraction circus sentence analyzer section describes relevancy signatures classify texts 
information extraction circus lehnert conceptual sentence analyzer extracts domain specific information text 
example domain terrorism circus extract names perpetrators victims targets weapons dates locations associated terrorist incidents 
information extracted dictionary domain specific structures called concept nodes 
concept node recognizes specific linguistic pattern uses pattern template extracting information 
example concept node dictionary terrorism domain contains concept node called murder triggered pattern murdered extracts murder victim 
similar concept node called murder active perpetrator triggered pattern murdered extracts perpetrator murder 
concept node activated sentence processing recognizes pattern text 
shows sample sentence instantiated concept nodes produced circus 
concept nodes generated response passive form verb murdered 
concept node murder passive victim extracts peasants murder victims second concept node murder passive perpetrator extracts perpetrators 
sentence peasants murdered 
murder passive victim victim peasants murder passive perpetrator perpetrator instantiated concept nodes theoretically concept nodes arbitrarily complex practice recognize simple linguistic constructs 
concept nodes represent general linguistic patterns shown 
information extraction done circus happens concept nodes crucial concept node dictionary domain 
multiple concept nodes may generated sentence concept nodes may generated 
sentences activate concept nodes effectively ignored 
building concept node dictionary hand extremely time consuming tedious 
estimate took approximately person hours experienced system developers build concept node dictionary principle single concept node extract item 
concept nodes produced autoslog riloff riloff extract item time

relevancy signatures motivation information retrieval systems classify texts basis multiple words phrases 
classification tasks classifying texts basis single linguistic expression effective 
single words usually provide context reliable indicators domain slightly larger phrases reliable 
example word dead reliable keyword murder people die ways murder 
expressions containing word dead reliable indicators murder 
shows expressions involving words dead fire percentage occurrences expression appeared relevant texts 
results texts muc corpus 
texts muc corpus retrieved general database contain words related terrorism half describe relevant terrorist incident 
shows occurrence expression dead appeared relevant text 
muc fourth message understanding conference held muc proceedings muc organizers defined terrorism complicated set guidelines general relevant event specific incident occurred latin america involving terrorist perpetrator civilian target 
expression rel 
dead left dead number 
dead set fire opened fire weapon 
fire strength associations related expressions occurrences expression left dead occurrences number 
dead dead appeared relevant texts 
expression dead implicit connotation foul play suggests murder suspected 
contrast expressions left dead number 
dead refer military casualties terrorist nature 
shows expressions involving word fire different correlations relevance 
expression set fire strongly correlated relevant texts describing incidents expression opened fire highly correlated relevant texts describing terrorist shooting incidents 
expression weapon 
fire rifle fire gun fire highly correlated terrorist texts appears texts describing military incidents 
results show similar linguistic expressions different associations relevance domain 
furthermore distinctions difficult impossible human anticipate 
observations developed text classification algorithm automatically identifies linguistic expressions strongly associated domain uses classify new texts 
approach uses underlying information extraction system circus recognize linguistic context 
relevancy signatures algorithm signature defined pair consisting word concept node triggered word 
signature represents unique set linguistic expressions 
example signature murdered murder passive victim 
represents expressions form murdered murdered murdered signatures generated automatically applying circus text corpus 
relevancy signature signature highly correlated relevant texts preclassified training corpus 
generate relevancy signatures domain training corpus processed circus produces set instantiated concept nodes text

epsilon loosely denote number occurrences signature appeared relevant texts 
thresholds identify signatures highly correlated relevant texts 
relevance threshold selects signatures conditional probability frequency threshold selects signatures appeared times training corpus

researchers information retrieval community experimented phrase indexing create effective indexing terms croft dillon fagan 
systems build complex phrases combinations nouns noun modifiers occasionally verbs 
function words prepositions auxiliary verbs ignored 
stopword lists typically throw away function words preventing considered generation indexing terms 
information retrieval systems lose ability plural stemming algorithm 
stopword lists stemming algorithms perform valuable functions information retrieval systems 
stopword lists substantially reduce size inverted files stemming algorithms allow system generalize different morphological variants 
common stopwords contribute substantially meaning phrases 
believe certain types common stopwords prepositions auxiliary verbs available building complex phrases 
similarly stemming algorithms may appropriate terms 
users benefit able specify term stemmed 
automated indexing systems produce better results stemmed non stemmed indexing terms available 
disk space cheaper space considerations nearly important think twice throwing away potentially valuable words simply sake space 
function words represent complex concepts presence provides important clues information surrounding 
text corpora grow size scope user queries specific information retrieval systems need subtle domain discriminations 
results suggest information retrieval systems benefit small words part larger phrases 
shown effectiveness slightly different linguistic expressions word forms vary substantially believe differences exploited produce effective indexing terms
