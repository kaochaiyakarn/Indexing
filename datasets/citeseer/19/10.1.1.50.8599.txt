reciprocity adaptive mechanism evolution cooperative behavior group self interested agents received considerable attention researchers social sciences economics community 
researchers social sciences focused nature altruism cause evolution groups animals krebs schmitz 
mathematical biologist economists tried explain rationality altruistic behavior groups self interested agents proposing various fitness models analyze success altruistic individuals importantly evolution genetic traits supporting altruistic behavior nowak may sigmund 
goal model altruistic behavior animals address issues raised social science literature topic 
purpose propose mechanisms cooperation encouraged established groups self interested agents 
compare contrast build reported game theorists economists topic 
space limitations permit thorough review literature 
identify common trait body surveyed identify underlying problems common trait motivate proposed approach problems 
mathematical biologists economists evolution altruistic behavior deals idealized problem called prisoner dilemma rapoport repetitive symmetrical identical games 
objections raised sanitized games understanding evolution complex phenomena reciprocal altruism boyd 
analyze detail cited share typical assumptions economists mathematical biologists set suggestions relaxing restrictive assumptions 
seminal piece robert axelrod shown stable cooperative behavior arise self interested agents adopt reciprocative attitude axelrod 
basic assumptions include agents interested maximizing individual utilities pre disposed help agents group repeatedly interact extended period time interactions identical playing game agents individually identify agents maintain history interactions agents individual agents change behavioral strategy time composition agent groups change infrequently changes minimal agent leaves joins group time 
primarily simulated games lesser extent theoretical analysis axelrod convincingly argues effectiveness simple behavioral rules variety agent interactions 
specifically shows simple deterministic reciprocal scheme cooperating agent cooperated previous interaction strategy obvious reasons referred tit tat strategy quite robust efficient maximizing local utility 
behavioral strategy exploited strategies designed purpose general tit tat strategy wide variety strategies 
properties tit tat strategy deserve special mention ffl agents strategy system performance optimal ffl stable invasion agents strategies agent strategy introduced group tit tat agents obtain greater utility obtained tit tat agents 
axelrod interesting convincing believe assumptions results inapplicable number domains practical interest 
analyze critical assumptions identifying violated domains practical interest motivate need alternative framework reciprocal behavior believe term reciprocal behavior compared term altruistic behavior appropriately summarizes motivation mechanism avoids unrealistic assumptions initial decision tit tat uses history interaction decision crucial 
axelrod assumes agents start cooperating leads everybody cooperating forever 
agents start cooperating tat strategy produce cooperative action 
assumptions initial decisions equally meaningful tit tat strategy 
symmetrical interactions axelrod assumes interaction perfectly symmetrical 
implies agents cooperate interaction incur cost benefit 
real life interactions interaction agent incurs cost incurs benefit 
individual interacts asymmetrical averaging ensemble interactions put agent times position position beneficiary 
agent decide help agent interaction considering past history expectations interactions 
repetition identical scenarios situation recurs infrequently real life 
parties involved environmental conditions impact agent decisions slightly different 
identical situation recurs times highly repeated assumed game axelrod 
real life situations agent decisions affected factors addressed mentioned body 
lack measure interactions assumed identical need measure cost cooperation 
real life scenarios differing circumstances need compared common metric 
example consider scenario time cost metric cooperation 
suppose helped picking set photographs dropped local store developing act cooperation cost minutes 
asks drive nearest airport cost hours 
honor request 
simple tit tat mechanism suggest cooperates may best choice 
lets take example little 
keeps repeating similar requests situation arises may help just helped time asked help keep continuing help 
straightforward application tit tat strategy suggest just modify saying cooperative action reciprocated exactly cooperative action address question comparing cost cooperation point mechanism comparing past favors expectations tit tat strategy 
designed scenarios individual cooperation acts benefits party incurs cost 
simple reciprocative strategy appropriate strategy real life situations underlying assumptions motivate violated situations 
proposal agents reciprocity interaction scheme realistic assumptions 
specifically believe probabilistic deterministic reciprocity scheme suitable real life problems 
scheme properties ffl allow agents initiate cooperative relationships implies able handle asymmetrical interactions ffl mechanism compare cooperation costs ffl allow agents inclined help favorable balance help received help offered help ffl able flexibly adjust inclination cooperate current load inclined cooperate busy
