statistical properties text create metadata grace crowder crowder cs umbc edu charles nicholas nicholas cs umbc edu computer science electrical engineering department university maryland baltimore county baltimore md march problem statement large dynamic distributed text corpus traditional information retrieval ir techniques handle growth data volume user base data diversity see bowman 
data distributed description data residing location needs maintained 
data similar data traditional ir searches memory prior searching secondary storage index suggested frakes 
amount memory needed hold inverted file index time required compute results query unmanageable corpus grows gigabytes see witten 
proposed solution propose solution making mediated agent architecture metadata direct queries appropriate agents 
mediated agent supported part united states department defense 
architecture consists application agents managing local corpora brokers metadata direct searches 
architecture metadata automatically generated effective query search browse retrieval data smaller data 
approach metadata key scalability 
metadata characterize data purposes including query processing browsing retrieval 
metadata may take different forms 
require metadata properties ffl effective metadata says information relevant probably relevant ffl concise smaller data describes ffl generated automatically little human intervention required ffl create metadata metadata ffl interchangeable form allow queries documents metadata compared 
cafe call mediated architecture cafe cooperating agents find 
cafe application agents brokers 
application agents communicate entities system kqml knowledge query manipulation language described mayfield 
addition application agent responsible data space means provide access data generating registering metadata performing traditional ir tasks handling queries corpus updates brokers similar application agents 
data manage metadata supplied application agents brokers 
brokers necessarily organized strict hierarchy sibling communication allowed 
centroids metadata introduced shannon gram sequence characters 
example grams taken sentence ample 
pearce church damashek shown ir systems grams terms desirable properties language independence resistance effective retrieval 
frequency distribution grams document called gram profile 
pearce nicholas showed document gram profile serves characterize content 
mean collected gram profiles set documents centroid 
note centroid document isn real document 
corpus centroid subset member documents 
centroids metadata appealing telltale gram ir system supplied sponsor seen grams satisfy properties mentioned ffl effective demonstrated experiments telltale 
ffl concise example gram centroid megabyte wall street journal corpus requires megabytes 
ffl generated automatically single pass set documents suffices calculate centroid 
ffl collection centroids centroid right 
ffl interchangeable gram profiles centroids calculated queries documents corpora manner 
experiments show size centroid depends choice grows number unique grams centroid 
shows grows number unique grams megabyte wall street journal corpus grows 
furthermore value corpus grows number unique grams corpus grows appears reach plateau shown 
metadata generated cafe broker running telltale manage metadata direct queries appropriate agents 
total number grams corpus unique grams function corpus size wall street journal corpus number unique grams reaches plateau corpus grows assess effectiveness retrieval conducted experiments compare effectiveness telltale smart

scored collections compare ir systems 
scored collection consists set documents set queries relevance judgements queries 
scored collection document corpus judged relevant relevant query 
observations precision difference precision difference smart telltale cranfield collection precision difference smart telltale scored collections readily available cornell 
cranfield collection documents queries aerodynamics compare telltale smart 
precision recall measures easily computed working scored collection relevance judgements supplied human experts exist document respect query 
precision metric compare information retrieval engines 
defined precision value th document returned query documents relevant set 
perfect system precision value meaning relevant documents irrelevant documents 
comparison precision difference smart telltale averages possible range 
see 
lets conclude cranfield collection telltale perform significantly worse smart performs 
cafe large scale document information retrieval system ffl able handle large corpora ffl dynamic application agents update corpora associated metadata ffl scalable choice gram centroids metadata removes traditional ir distinctions metadata corpus document query 
plan continue comparing smart telltale scored collections studying characteristics queries result sets smart telltale performed implemented user interface agents back server agents 
broker uses metadata route queries nearing completion
