developed method called latent semantic indexing lsi improve people access electronically available textual information deerwester dumais furnas 
approaches retrieving textual materials depend lexical match words users requests database objects 
typically text objects contain words common users query returned relevant 
word retrieval systems far ideal objects relevant users query missed unrelated irrelevant materials retrieved 
believe fundamental characteristics human verbal behavior underly retrieval difficulties bates fidel furnas 
tremendous diversity words people describe object concept synonymy requesters different words author indexer information relevant materials missed 
conversely word meaning polysemy irrelevant materials retrieved 
lsi approach tries overcome problems automatically organizing objects semantic structure appropriate information retrieval 
done modeling implicit higher order structure association terms objects 
assume underlying latent structure pattern word usage partially obscured variability word choice 
statistical techniques estimate latent structure get rid obscuring noise

overview latent semantic indexing theory 
particular latent semantic indexing analysis tried uses singular value decomposition svd technique closely related eigenvector decomposition factor analysis forsythe malcolm moler cullum 
take large matrix term text object association data decompose set typically orthogonal factors original matrix approximated linear combination 
formally rectangular matrix example matrix terms objects decomposed product matrices orthonormal columns diagonal rank socalled singular value decomposition unique certain row column sign permutations 
largest singular values kept corresponding columns matrices rest deleted yielding matrices resulting matrix september dumais unique matrix rank closest squares sense idea matrix containing independent linear components captures major associational structure matrix throws noise 
reduced model usually approximate term text object association data number dimensions reduced model smaller number unique terms minor differences terminology ignored 
reduced model closeness objects determined pattern term usage objects near regardless precise words describe description depends kind consensus term meanings dampening effects polysemy 
particular means text objects share words user query may near consistent major patterns word usage 
term semantic indexing describe method reduced svd representation captures major associative relationships terms text objects 
interpret analysis performed svd geometrically 
location terms objects space row vectors matrices respectively 
space cosine dot product vectors corresponds estimated similarity 
term object vectors represented space similarities combination terms objects easily obtained 
retrieval proceeds terms query identify point space text objects ranked similarity query 
attempt interpret underlying dimensions factors rotate intuitively meaningful orientation 
analysis require able describe factors verbally merely able represent terms text objects queries way escapes unreliability ambiguity redundancy individual terms descriptors 
geometric analysis relationship lsi standard vector retrieval methods clear 
standard vector model terms assumed independent form orthogonal basis vectors vector space salton mcgill van rijsbergen 
independence assumption quite unreasonable parameter estimation tractable 
researchers suggested ways term dependencies added vector model van rijsbergen yu parameter estimation remains severe difficulty especially higher order associations included 
lsi reduced dimensional svd gives orthogonal basis vectors term vectors positioned space reflect correlations usage documents 
terms objects represented space queries formed combination terms objects combination terms objects returned response query 
standard vector method lsi representation desirable properties require boolean queries ranks retrieval output decreasing order document query similarity easily accommodates term weighting easy modify location individual vectors dynamic retrieval environments
