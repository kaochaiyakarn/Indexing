limitations criticisms building usually difficult dimensions 
finding ways spaces dimensions open problem 
traditional ai image processing techniques offer implementing 
noted automatically generating computationally expensive 
true need done 
alternative randomly tweaking procedures effect worse 
largely going ai anyway little obvious effect 
criticism fractal behaviour really exists particularly biological systems 
evidence fractal behaviour taken seriously 
number answers 
clear fractals far widespread thought days treated mathematical dubious 
corresponding growth interest dynamical systems especially chaos shows widespread originally thought noted earlier fractals typical signature dynamical processes 
accepted body organism product dynamical process embryology distinct tendency behaviour reflect dynamical structuring body 
weak argument clearer inverse machines product mechanical design tend behave mechanically 
third answer simply methods examine behaviour usually statistics tend hide evidence fractal behaviour 
shown towers hanoi example 
statistician look solutions problem typical approach count numbers moves different rings 
turn strong correlation size ring number moves take plotted nice graph 
unfortunately graph removed sequencing information solution naturally behaviour suddenly stops looking fractal 
methods measure behaviour need applied carefully avoid smoothing small scale deviations key fractal analysis 
measurement applied carefully may turn fractal behaviour far common appears just dynamical systems nature turned far common appeared years ago 
similar point barnsley classical geometry tool analysis voltages point human brain suggesting fractal interpolation functions obtain better fit kinds data 
examples perception 
simple kind response stimulus represented brownian motion system described mandelbrot 
addition perception complicates dimensions approach 
appears valid criticism approach stands needed investigate possible approaches linking perception action 

examples fractal behaviour technique managed reconstruct program purely observed behaviour program relying fractal character behaviour 
core claim general behaviour described similar concepts fractals self affinity 
justification applying ideas fractal behaviour model agency 
number analyses human behaviour clear similarity fractal patterns 
example fractal behaviour multiple selves model agent single agent appears result dynamic collusion sub agents complete self right 
justification seen multiple personality disorder berne model structural analysis 
related multiple selves model considered dennett basis mind 
expected kind dynamic collusion selves described dennett naturally form dynamical system natural look dynamical behaviour 
berne model structural analysis especially close order structural analysis shows personality composed categories ego state child adult parent may composed finer detail pattern corresponding ego states identifiable third order 
berne picture containing picture precursor today fractal images 
similar example minsky society mind structural model involving similarity agents 
behavioural example seen classification feelings haugeland fuzzy categories sensations reactions emotions interpersonal feelings sense merit people oneself moods 
haugeland goes way identifying dimensions criteria discriminate different kinds feeling 
sloman describes related hierarchy affective dispositions defines number categories discriminated largely duration hard change resist 
sloman haugeland analyses common view dimensions allows elements compared similarities differences identified dimensions 
simple example distinction reaction love interpersonal feeling 
similarities appear coincidence due higher order functions derived evolution lower order ones 
evolution transforms functions behaviour transformed corresponding ways 
humphrey says relationship form sentiments quality corresponding sensations take relationship non arbitrary original emphasis 
relationship non arbitrary behaviour show affinity analogous fractal images 

applying method approach analysing pattern behaviour infer procedure embodies behaviour number potential applications 
traditional ai arena number possibilities hierarchical planning game playing general kind dynamical fractal structure landscape program handle 
deterministic approach described sufficient realistic applications kind mentioned potential nondeterministic behaviour families interpolation different systems 
potentially far exciting possibility construct feeling agent simulates kind behaviour expected haugeland sloman classification dispositions feelings agent implementing kind structural analysis described berne
