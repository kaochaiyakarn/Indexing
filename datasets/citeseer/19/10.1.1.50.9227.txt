concluding remarks advocated calculational style reasoning temporal propositions misguided suggest galois algebra replace temporal logic 
logical approach invaluable investigating decidability axiomatizability expressiveness related issues 
existing decision procedures temporal logic useful automatic verification example model checking 
hand suggest galois algebra better suited human user 
mathematicians human beings general think concepts formulae 
storing seventeen axioms head problem computer prefer remember fl gamma fl conjugate linear case perfect galois connection 
analogies structural properties symmetry duality readily recognized proved algebra form core human understanding temporal reasoning 
contrast style algebraic calculation logical deduction 
equational inequational rewriting fundamental technique mathematics everybody learns school 
tried show calculations guided shape formulae proofs flow naturally dynamics symbols 
rarely need unexpected step pull rabbit hat 
contrast logical deductions build final theorem bottom fashion giving little pieces saying fit 
deduction styles proofs little structure intermediate results form tree hard write 
accident chains equations implications common mathematical literature logical deduction systems hardly employed convincing readers theorems course books logic 
von karger trade algebraic logical style may compared relation specification languages programming languages 
designed computers day far successful 
painful experience taught errors occur easily costly initial informal phase system design 
minimize risk error stage specification languages tailored human price sacrificing mechanical lr syntax automatic executability 
art turning specifications implementations gradually established engineering craft consequence specification languages gaining acceptance steadily 
similar way expect calculational human oriented method algebraic calculation gain place established machinery logical deduction
