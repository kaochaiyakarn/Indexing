model emotional systems allows distinction different affective phenomena 
instance primary emotions modeled activation natural releasers particular emotional system disgust fear 
primary emotions play essential role preparation appropriate emotional responses adaptive agent 
case fear emotional system fast primary emotions detects dangerous situation generates defensive responses maximize probability surviving 
emotion blends mixed emotions 
consensus issue basic emotion researchers believe nonbasic emotions result blends mixes basic ones izard 
instance fear surprise generate alarm joy fear produce guilt 
mixing higher order emotions generally conceived cognitive operation concurrent activation cognitive affective systems 
proposed framework provide explicit models higher order emotions blends emerge activation basic emotional systems 
cases possible active emotional systems bias particular system perceptual behavior system non conflicting ones explained case behavior systems 
emotional memories secondary emotions 
emotional systems capacity acquiring learned releasers previously mentioned correspond stimuli tend associated predictive natural releasers 
activation emotional systems learned releasers correspond referred researchers emotional memories secondary emotions ledoux damasio 
secondary emotions occur start making orderly associations objects situations primary emotions 
require complex processing including cases retrieval emotional memories similar previous experiences 
secondary emotions play adaptive role dealing situations occurred evolution escaping danger finding food mating
