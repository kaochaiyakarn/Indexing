ratio speed distance affects assessment usability 
speed fast user quickly arrive proximity destination point hard exactly desired point 
hand speed slow user may step far neutral point quickly arrive point stopping desired point necessitates moving back steps causes inaccuracy 
usability test tells users enjoy traveling slow speed arrive desired point difficulty 
walking realized means controlling viewing position virtual space virtual camera
