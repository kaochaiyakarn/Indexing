just discovered power distributed representation 
connectionists noted small localist network chief example unrepresentative connectionist endeavour 
asks deepest philosophical commitment connectionist movement answer surely rejection atomic symbol bearer meaning 
connectionists feel atomic tokens simply carry information useful modeling human cognition 
distributed malleable representations cornerstone connectionist endeavour 
reason localist networks regarded connectionists really connectionist 
networks employ precisely traditional notion atomic symbols new twist added connecting associative links 
call localist connectionism symbolic ai soft constraint satisfaction localist network lack understanding connectionist endeavor 
believe depends localist distributed distinction connectionist hand believes depends 
connectionist distributed representation just spread version single node comes clearly footnote 
connectionist group nodes functioning separately functional properties far isolated unit
