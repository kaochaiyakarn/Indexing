call behavior social navigation communication interaction users email means communication 
social navigation phenomena quite common current tools web browsers email clients offer little support 
describe social navigation useful better supported systems 
describe prototype systems originally designed explicitly tools social navigation provide features typical social navigation systems 
systems juggler system combination textual virtual environment web client 
system prototype organizer called vortex 
systems describe fundamental principles social navigation systems 

looking information world wide web people variety navigation strategies 
typical strategies unoriented wandering called surfing browsing 
undirected useful strategy searching specific information 
people commonly browse little web session due hyperlinked nature web 
people commonly browse little having looking 
find unrelated information interesting 
commonly users store pointers information hotlist bookmark collection copy pointer simple email message send friends think may interested information 
voluntary sharing information friends colleagues typical example call social navigation 
browsing scenario cases social navigation observable web 
natural type interaction users user asks information assumes knows user pointer 
type social navigation web pointer lists people maintain web pages essentially publicized hot lists everybody 
interesting information accessible person interested interesting facet social navigation 

navigational behavior world wide web navigation strategies web rely expertise users 
difficult information users collect lists addresses information browser hotlist bookmarks file 
addresses called uniform resource locators urls 
users invest time effort create structured web pages lists available users linking home pages 
looking information common strategy look pointer pages people related interests possibility consult web directory maintained free web users companies 
just example yahoo www yahoo com 
web reached state important issue information providers information web pointer information web directory hot lists 
web directories companies finance placing advertisements search pages directories essentially version social navigation act structure providers users described dieberger 
interesting special aspect types navigation services essentially provided free 
cases people personal profit providing pointer page may known people web mainly social aspect having web presence 

navigation needs structure interesting aspect pointer pages search engines personal pointer pages way provide structure essentially unstructured information space dieberger 
ongoing growth world wide web expression lost hyperspace traditionally describe navigation problems hypertext systems popular 
web reached size impossible quickly locate information 
lot useful information web information easily accessible information 
effective navigation users need perceivable structure information space 
users decide go don know direction head spatial metaphor 
spatial navigational concepts available web 
web provide meta information pages searching information browsing bound fail 

creating structure pointer pages probably web browsers web clients provide feature allows users store address pages url uniform resource locator find interesting want return 
lists pointers normally accessible pull menu client software bookmarks list called hotlist 
erickson personal communication 

personal home pages pointer pages provide users address book web addresses people invest lot convert nicely formatted structured web pages freely available web 
pages called pointers interesting stuff cool pages forth 
people really reason provide service free anyway probably reasons similar homepage place 
pointer pages provide addresses relatively small number pages classified reviewed person ideally checked broken links pages moved 
case user knows maintainer pointer page deduce knowledge person pointers find page 
example user looks information certain singer say start look pointer page friend fan music 
stress different navigational behavior types hypertext navigation 
real search involved commercial service structures classifies information space direct profit 
type navigation purely social process works user background information friend happens music 
traditional information domains library similar navigational behavior ask librarian 
type social navigation exists net looking pointer pages major difference user providing information directly involved 
looking friend pointer page asking friend secretary library shelf friend tends take books 
say approach web user intelligent agent tom erickson described 

institutional home pages similar personal pointer pages institutional pointer pages 
different cases distinguish pointer page maintained 
reason distinction university department may provide pointers departments doing related research provide pointers competing companies 
providing product information interesting context social navigation companies provide pointer pages useful related information 
just examples sun apple web sites try stress companies involvement internet provide extensive web style guides www sun com www apple com hi web design intro html 

related term social navigation way relatively new large amount related 
point thomas erickson especially erickson explicitly talks people collaborate web navigation 
erickson studies social aspects information environment 
juggler system see erickson bases observations textual virtual environment 
term social navigation publication dourish chalmers slightly different meaning 
dourish chalmers see social erickson personal communication 
navigation navigation cluster people navigation people looked 
separate navigation social semantic navigation underlying semantic relationship information mapped spatial metaphor 
continuing growth world wide web interest form collaborative navigation information filtering growing 
example concerning collaborative information filtering news messages letting users vote message usefulness 
examples grouplens system resnick rose borenstein 
example concerning collaborative web agent starr ackerman 
authors base assumption extra necessary voting people want invest 
similar assumption basis phoaks system phoaks index html uses frequency mention avoid voting scheme hill terveen 
related interest maltz ehrlich describes information filtering system sending pointers information 

interaction internet internet supported interaction communication users long web designed 
original arpanet communication tool reliably send messages 
initially communication web exclusively text possible send types information graphics sound video 
aside web internet interaction mainly text internet users problems sending receiving example graphics files email attachment view files unknown format 
great achievement web alleviate problems introducing standardized formats formatted text multi media documents 
information web available address information url uniform resource locator known 
user navigate location containing information described url communicated way 
traditional internet communication tools easily exchange urls 

overview communication net section look commonly means communication internet describe supports sharing pointers web information 

electronic mail probably common method send url somebody type email message send 
systems graphical user interfaces typing replaced copy paste operation 
transfer url email message easier error prone 
copy process procedure involving software packages get information user 
better reliable typing copy pasting error prone procedure takes time 
ease transfer urls people frequently special formatting email urls easy copy visually prominent 
examples intended urls separate lines lines dashes separate url remaining email content 
social protocols url mailing evolved copy paste urls emails 
solve problems urls long may get line wrapped message 
necessitates additional steps splice line wrapped url piece 

newsgroups transmitting urls newsgroup messages similar sending email 
news messages close connection web modern news clients recognize urls show active links news message 
example system news client macintosh ftp ftp dk pub news reader integrated netscape navigator home netscape com 
urls news message underlined colored blue web clients 
clicking causes url loaded web client 
macintosh works technology allows application remote control 
recognizing urls generally done searching lines containing text scanning forward till character valid url 
method disadvantage urls point services example gopher news mailto 
seldom supported 
method recognize abbreviated urls example www gatech edu 
shortcomings assume similar recognition features soon available email clients 

chat rooms textual virtual environments contrary asynchronous communication tools email news chat rooms textual virtual environments muds multi user mud object oriented provide synchronous communication 
means users want communicate time talk 
users connect server acts communication relay 
messages sent user immediately relayed users discussion 
delay sending receiving may just seconds 
need read said type reply type communication quasi synchronous medium response times minute largely depending network lag typing speed 
systems communicate web pointers people 
people discuss material web just talking 
real interaction pointing certain line document 
need know address certain web page ask user chat moo room may get url said type url web browser copy paste 
obvious type navigation easier systems recognize urls 
essentially juggler system see section 
url recognition supports receiving 
true social navigation occurs support sending side describe section 

media nowadays web clever marketing uses novelty character hype web marketing purposes 
new products feature home pages urls appear advertisements newspapers television radio 
urls dead pointers undergo transfer processes people 
main reason urls long hard remember 
people write store 
case somebody sees url communicates friend telephone situation worse 
impression advertising urls works mainly ugly new people bound notice 
urls stick ad thumb 
visual intensity ad manages legitimate means marketing today 
web pointers marketing useful communication tools necessary remember minute example name sufficient 
note starting netscape navigator version works typing complete url www com netscape accepts url form www com case url form www com middle name sufficient 
example url yield desired result 
communicating url suddenly easy 
note scheme presently works com domain 
sense com domain way 
browsers able try existing domains predetermined sequence 
url form try urls www com www edu www org forth 

interaction smoother section 
described current methods communicate web pointers users 
people want interact urls want point information information system 
exchanging addresses information cumbersome intermediate step eliminated possible 
note argument consider problems url fact uniform resource locator url describes exact location information 
information move url invalid 
urls don allow browser automatically access closest cheapest version information 
information issues see example andrews dieberger 

natural support pointing showing assuming want stick basic url method time ask ease interaction people point information 
answer quite simple url proper disappear users get handle information allows interact natural way 
asking directions city people probably point building writing exact address 
similarly web possible point information naturally cope address information 
users need get handle information essentially metaphor wrapped basic url 
method replace url internally effectively hides url user 
example handle news message contains document icons user select interact 
icons represents web page linked news message 
url hidden icon user access page associated metainformation title keywords modification date size page forth 
note plain page symbol real improvement people need information document decide really want access page 
page symbol disadvantage users activate page directly help distribute pointer people 
activate page copy paste url newly loaded page message 
page handles ideally objects copy pasted preserving associated meta information 
allow users include message author emails news forth 
functionality requires standardized representation page includes meta information transformed different representations task hand 
example page handle copied normal text editor represent meta information human readable form 
text copied news message news client able parse format convert page handle 
page handles allow users manipulate web information coherent piece having worry forgetting copy meta information 
handles manipulable objects user interface dragged copied object 
development world wide web happens fast surprise works systems close vision developed 
example possible drag drop urls objects applications macintosh platform similar functionality exists probably platforms 
apple project system see mcf research apple com quite close ideas meta content format mcf format describing meta information advocate 
information mcf see mcf research apple com hs mcf html 

seeing users seeing users necessarily mean video representation awareness presence users 
awareness special type meta information web page 
gives indication demand certain type information certain time give information accessing 
aware representing users accessing information brings host privacy issues 
positive side representation support better interaction virtual information space members group working project 
excellent discussion possibilities see bernstein 
example futuristic realization user awareness history enriched environment changes interactions 
method provides indirect hints people avoids issues 
methods important point users simply want know entire user population moves information environment locations suddenly attract large crowds users 
users called literature see andrews dieberger 
system showing information may avoid accessing servers temporarily overwhelmed user requests mirror site 
example system developed alex mike pinkerton jim pitkow georgia tech student project 
showed graphical representation pages web server moving points pages represent users 
system gives users sense going 
easy create system large sections web visual representation large parts web difficult problem 
example users accessing information represented see bernstein 
overview shows number methods exchange pointers information web today tools relatively 
social navigation occur systems exactly support 
communication systems web provide easy natural way share information create awareness web large shared information space 
show web huge information repository user 

example juggler juggler system principally takes idea recognizing urls output communication tool hiding user extends integrated system supports social navigation 
imagine users communicating chat room textual virtual environment 
user talks interesting web page 
wants show page user 
copy url say command user copy url output paste favorite web browser hit return 
obvious process greatly simplified automating process 
basic idea original design juggler system moo client recognizes urls output automatically tells web client load url moment finds 
juggler designed support interaction teacher students remote teaching support system school literature communication culture 
system meant distance learning system way communicate teacher office hours forcing students come campus time 
author special focus spatial metaphors navigation juggler system spatial metaphors navigation served tool study spatial metaphors see dieberger 
layout real environment virtual meeting space enhanced meaning social interactions space described erickson 
follow project juggler system consisting modified moo system mud object oriented textual virtual environment developed xerox parc juggler client virtual graduate student conference 
users conference little internet experience created simplified version system fewer features better support social navigation 
examples section taken second version juggler system noted 
detailed information juggler system please refer manual available web dieberger 

textual virtual environments textual virtual environments developed networked textual adventure games 
users log central server maintaining system state game status generating appropriate feedback user actions 
typical examples systems muds multi user mud object oriented system juggler system 
moo systems seldom game character 
systems support communication interaction group users 
acronym moo simplicity stress functions describe implemented type textual virtual environments 
moo virtual environment including user actions described text 
user says described andreas says hi user uses emote command smile described andreas smiles 
moo systems provide users wealth verbal non verbal communication commands communication interaction system flexible curtis 
system response time quite short see moo communication real time communication 
moo environments location users different rooms communication works accordingly people room hear user talks 
moo environments albeit textual systems provide users surprisingly rich getting environment quite realistic environment interaction communication 
general information systems see curtis curtis nichols erickson resnick 
information technical aspects juggler system juggler supports spatial navigation see dieberger dieberger 

talking people pointing pages saying basic idea juggler system mentioned moo client recognizes urls moo output causes web client case netscape navigator load page 
netscape remote controlled juggler implemented macintosh computer hypercard 
urls recognized searching typical prefixes urls gopher forth 
prefix output scanned forwards till character valid url encountered 
url hidden output sent netscape loaded 
effect setup user talks web page command say look page www gatech edu user see depending preference settings merlin says look page www gatech edu merlin says look page second case may look little strange corresponding web pages pop netscape users soon learn happened 
easy looks intermediate step really supporting social navigation reasons user copy paste type url moo command user describe hand send url 
soon recognized shortcoming changed design juggler client providing facility easily point web pages see section 
noted simple setup scanning urls shortened urls prefix 
sort standardized moo client protocol mcp developed jupiter systems curtis nichols curtis 
mcp uses band commands establish virtual communication channel moo server moo client 
loading web pages caused sending mcp command client eliminating need search urls output 
juggler supports particular mcp command 

looking people objects advantages scanning urls simplicity urls associated types activities objects juggler system 
just necessary embed url description object looking object displays description url output loaded client 
application behavior insert home page url user description 
looking user home page pops 
object url associated users give object users 
looking object retrieves associated web page 
object description serves reminder access metaphor web page 
typical examples objects represent books letters signs 
similarly possible associate urls locations moo room automatically displays certain web page entering 
aspects pertain spatial navigation aspect juggler system 
details see dieberger 
allows people easily access user home page having deliberately ask address page 
activity similar accessing people related information person home page web directly involve person 
contrary accessing home page web approach require exact url users directly look person access information 
mentioned main advantage querying pointer pages web user able obtain address person home page moo carries thought step 

point button people juggler client provides feature easily point material web 
basic assumption users want share information juggler client web client time 
browsing web essentially independent communication channel moo urls transferred 
user find interesting page wants transmit url user obvious page user wants point page front window web browser 
juggler provides button grabs address page currently displayed web client wraps explanatory text sends emote command moo see 
clicking button results output merlin points page web page title netscape georgia tech homepage 
corresponding page pops screen users moo room 
method pointing information easier copying pasting typing urls feature truly supports social navigation system users frequently 
juggler moo client 
note point url button 
certain drawbacks simple implementation 
emote command addresses users currently moo room 
easy annoy people constantly pointing web pages especially reading previously sent page 
obvious solution temporarily switch loading urls users may interesting pages 
solution implemented juggler store urls conversation log document handles described section 
urls easily recalled context conversation 
juggler client moo system virtual conference instrumented navigation activities typical social navigation activities point button logged 
logs formally evaluated conclude availability simple effective point feature increased social navigation activity 
logs direct experience moo sessions observed users juggler client point web pages users clients 
observation surprising considering effort operation requires normal moo client 
conversations users know generally liked point button users set client display urls moo output 
preliminary results consider informal support thesis people want see urls tool allows share web pages natural way 
related form pointing pages realized earlier versions juggler eliminated conference version 
feature parse local html file extract urls file 
urls provided pop list pointed selecting pop list see 
url palette earlier client version 
basic idea feature support student professor communication discussed set web pages student created point course material may collected pointer file 
version virtual conference didn see similar feature eliminated 

pointing pages objects pointing information users restricts system synchronous communication system users tell information people directly see 
information objects juggler system interesting 
objects metaphors information carriers convey urls meta information 
examples message bulletin board moo internal mail message object bookshelf slide projector presents sequence web pages explaining text 
information placed objects retrieved users leisure 
order system useful features pointing pages creation information objects 
admittedly stresses metaphor users point web page moo bookshelf users coped quite 
insure bookshelf sees page everybody room user notify bookshelf wants add book 
necessarily ideal solution problem works keeps number features system minimum 
assume providing information objects personality instance making behave agents pointing designed appear logical 
conversations juggler users know users quickly adopted feature 
due bug original bookshelf object urls lost users lost faith point button 
shows users willing adopt simple way share pointer objects agents feature reliable 
virtual conference point button conjunction
