high latencies common internet typically ms roundtrip higher latencies modem connections exhibit typically ms roundtrip results large user base concerned network delay 
game players refer delays lag lc due deleterious visual impact games 
interactive gaming extremely delay sensitive 
known users interactive voice video applications internet telephony video conferencing require roundtrip delays ms

internet service providers isps concerned lag 
years number isps founded charter primarily supporting high quality gaming environment users 
led isps examine evaluate new emerging network components modem servers routers ensure provide reasonably low delays 
low latency optimization primary design goal network hardware manufacturers near 
order properly design evaluate hardware low latency gaming environment require accurate source models network game traffic 
academic trade literature completely ignored gaming 
particular find invariants gaming traffic statistical characteristics gaming host generates network traffic parameterized analytical models simulation 
ideally models simple parsimonious 
currently clear game traffic share similar characteristics 
gaming architecture design human factors number reasons game traffic models parameters may vary significantly connectivity games played modem lan clever game designers may fine tune software send traffic modems due lower available bitrate 
game design different games different methods communicate 
example games may require nxn connectivity participating hosts send messages peers consist centralized server receives updates number clients broadcasts resulting game state 
lan broadcast multicast techniques 
game style fast action shoot em ups may generate traffic slower paced interactive problem solving games 
particular shoot em games require player split second decisions 
game state updated times second player screen player may able respond attack opponent dodge missile properly 
fast paced games may require participating hosts transmit update periodically ms slower games may send updates state changed significantly update 
user experience playing style different users play games different strategies 
example shoot em games main strategies emerged players hunters continuously move tend wait location opponent 
strategies may result differing traffic characteristics game generates traffic state updates periodically
