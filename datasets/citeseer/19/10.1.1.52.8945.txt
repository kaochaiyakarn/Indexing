evolutionary timetabling assuming familiarity basic processes eas suffices describe approach chromosome representation fitness function 
unfamiliar basics eas consult texts 
chromosome representation timetable chromosome vector symbols total length recall number events divided contiguous gene chunks 
alleles ith chunk represent time place agent assignments ith event 
naturally sets possible alleles time place agent genes respectively identified sets simple example chromosome abcdef represents timetable event starts time place involving agent event starts time place involving agent constitutes direct representation opposed indirect style common job shop scheduling implemented timetabling 
relative advantages disadvantages styles scope central point interest 
suffice say comparison complications far direct approach enhanced intelligent mutation operators take great advantage directness representation feasibly constructed indirect style equal terms ingenious version indirect style observations properly backed empirically 
fitness function maximally fit timetable clearly satisfies imposed constraints 
reasonable distinguish timetables terms fitness numbers kinds different constraints violated 
choice fitness function meets behaviour follows set constraints problem penalty associated constraint timetable violates constraint relative penalty values may chosen reflect intuitive judgement relative importance satisfying different kinds constraint

general penalty function rough choice penalty settings derived course organisers notion relative importance different constraints appears adequately robust problems 
specific lecture timetabling problem msc course department artificial intelligence university edinburgh involves taught course modules spread terms 
course organised themes involving particular combination modules compulsory optional 
choices modules available ai department students may choose modules computer science cs department 
complicating factor cs dept inconvenient bus ride away ai dept comprises start times day day day week 
day slots half hourly intervals am pm 
comprises large collection lectures tutorials lab sessions hour long hours long 
student enrolled course attend lectures involving course tutorials labs include tutorials labs course 
separate courses pre assigned term term 
academic year separate lecture timetabling problem term involving roughly half modules available course 
full set constraints need faced follow options student options kept open far possible 
pair lectures theme overlap timetable 
generally lectures overlap expectation students may wish take courses event spread individual timetable student spread fairly evenly 
student sit lectures single day 
events individual student attend evenly spaced week 
different lectures topic may prolog lectures week occur different days 
travel time student minutes free travel events cs dept events ai dept slot exclusions cs lectures occur morning slots ai lectures afternoon slots arises inter departmental agreement 
lectures starting pm pm avoided possible 
similar vein various constraints form event start time arise owing commitments staff involved 
slot specifications various constraints form event start time arising various reasons 
capacity size lecture tutorial exceed capacity room occurs 
room cope event lecture tutorial lab time main difference lecture examination timetabling 
room exclusions constraints room assignments particular events easily derived capacity constraints information expected sizes events 
addition considerations lead priori constraints form event occur room 
example event may demand disabled access certain audio visual requirements unavailable room room specifications similarly constraints apparent form event occur room 
juxtaposition preferably tutorials laboratory sessions course occur week week lecture course 
particularly necessary tutorial lab session may lectures held hopefully earlier week 
cases desirable vital 
translating constraints fitness function case happens lecture agent lecturer predetermined individual lecturers decided advance providing details style exclusion constraints slots available 
tutors tutorials lab sessions pre determined way point incorporating timetable stage usually advance term simply know sure available 
problem need consider set chromosomes length 
constraints dealt follows keeping options open options constraint handled interpreting large collection binary constraints involving distinct pair events expected share students 
convenience derive set virtual students takes distinct set possible options term 
set virtual students derive collection distinct binary constraints events 
binary constraint occurs pair distinct lectures taken virtual student 
similar constraint holds distinct lectures module lectures tutorials module 
constraint needed different tutorials labs course tutorials labs different courses 
may scheduled simultaneously due course gives rise constraints affect students choice set tutorial lab sessions available module 
amounts collection binary constraints form overlap time fitness function check violation turn 
similarly clear basic problem avoiding clashes lecture exam timetabling problem dealt 
notice incorporate travel time constraint 
break say minutes assigned rooms take minutes travel options constraint effectively violated 
violation check options constraints simply accessing place genes travel time matrix places account travel time constraints 
event spread constraints event spread constraints handled number ways 
event spread individual students explicitly calculate measure measures event spread virtual student 
alternatively reasonably approximate examining measure measures spread timetable 
offer effect typically computationally cheaper approach offer potential control tradeoff different aspects event spread individual students 
method experiments detailed follows fitness function notes virtual student number instances events scheduled day virtual student events scheduled day virtual student 
different penalty term associated penalty weighted sum instances summed virtual students contribution fitness event spread constraint 
different day constraints clearly handled way options constraints 
pair lectures module simply check directly chromosome assigned slots day 
appropriate penalty added 
exclusions specifications easy see exclusion constraints directly translated simple violation check functions chromosome representation 
notice just simply pre arrange chromosomes violate constraints place 
doctor allele range gene specified allele ranges non excluded alleles 
choosing pre satisfaction exclusion specification constraints option penalising violations straightforward 
constraints exist pre satisfied space may lack excellent timetables violate exclusions example ways 
hand pre satisfaction speeds evaluation promises speed search reducing search space 
full ramifications choice scope suffices point option available system implements technique 
experiments discussed exclusion specification constraints prespecified 
penalised constraint lectures 
msc course organisers preferable avoid acceptable trade constraint violations 
capacity constraints check room capacity isn exceeded translate room capacity constraint constraints form room contain cap students timeslot room timeslot cap student capacity room evaluation system simply current candidate timetable student load room slot runs list constraints checking turn accumulating penalties violations
