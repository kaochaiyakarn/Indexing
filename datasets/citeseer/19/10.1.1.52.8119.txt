grouplens project seeks alleviate problem information overload applying collaborative filtering techniques usenet news internet resources 
doing hope help restore order usenet build renewed sense community

non collaborative solutions early days usenet people tried find ways reduce number messages process day 
section consider non collaborative solutions solutions information single user 
earliest non collaborative techniques relied matching keywords header fields news articles 
sophisticated keyword matching techniques emerged applied techniques information retrieval 
kill files score files methods introduced usenet community reduce noise level 
introduced general mechanism 
allows user specify certain subjects authors wants see allows user give interesting subjects authors high scores uninteresting subjects authors low scores 
problem techniques coarseness 
articles containing desired keyword interesting generally poor writers occasionally produce article worth reading 
additionally keywords difficult identify presence aliases synonyms misspelled words 
moderated newsgroups approach reducing noise level usenet creation moderated newsgroups 
moderated newsgroup person moderator approve article distributed usenet 
moderator responsible rejecting articles topic inflammatory generally poor quality 
problem moderated groups re quire large time commitment moderator quality judgment left single person 
programmable agents programmable agents simple programs perform actions behalf users 
programmable agents information filtering prioritize messages gather messages folders keyword reply messages 
instance information lens system enables unsophisticated users automatically perform actions response messages 
object lens extends information lens domains including databases hypertext 
intelligent agents july issue communications acm devoted state art intelligent agent research 
issue includes discussions agents designed reduce information overload 

agents address meeting scheduling email handling netnews filtering 
netnews agent known newt

user feedback newt able weighted judgments news articles containing keywords 
intelligent agents information filtering suffer drawbacks keyword techniques 
additional problem agents trained 
norman points interaction instruction agents difficult problem solved satisfactorily 
collaborative solutions collaborative filtering systems reactions opinions people seen piece information predictions value piece information people seen 
collaborative filtering heavily informal ways 
users regularly forward articles articles friends colleagues explicit implicit message 
collaborative filtering systems formalize process effectively incorporate larger set users data 
utility collaborative filtering extends domain usenet news realm movies videos audio cds :10.1.1.30.6583
usenet represents uniquely challenging problem collaborative filtering system sheer volume information items ratings collected predictions calculated 
new messages produced usenet day dwarfs number new cds movies produced entire year 
tapestry tapestry system early collaborative filtering system designed help small groups people solve information overload problem 
tapestry sophisticated subjective evaluations 
allows filtering incoming information streams including email usenet news 
people post evaluations users choose evaluators pay attention 
evaluations contain text just numeric rating boolean accept reject 
tapestry system users combine keyword criteria subjective criteria form requests 
example request give articles containing word collaborative pat evaluated evaluation contains word excellent 
tapestry works community common interests 
grouplens extends concepts tapestry system ways 
grouplens provides predictions aggregation ratings entered users 
second grouplens require user know evaluations advance 
see em system possible attempt cancel article widely cross posted seen blatantly commercial posting 
model person net sees think shouldn posted issue notice 
just type usenet message weight notice carries greater poster net reputation 
people agree issuer criteria feel person judge standard accept notices 
notice accepted user typically mark message read user file 
notices remove message local spool keeping users local system seeing article 
grouplens approach grouplens collaborative filtering system usenet news 
aim grouplens help people find articles huge stream available usenet articles 
effect grouplens automatically selects group people act personal moderators newsgroup 
moderators selected finding people substantial agreement past articles 
users ensure privacy entering ratings pseudonyms reducing effectiveness predictions 
usenet news readers take advantage grouplens reading news news client 
provide clients library available authors want 
example client shown 
connects user local nntp server retrieve usenet news articles connects grouplens server share filtering information 
user fetches articles newsgroup news reader sends message grouplens server requesting predictions user value article

privacy privacy important issue large scale collaborative filtering system 
ways handle user privacy issues collaborative filtering system 
users may anonymous ratings submitted user identification 
ratings submitted anonymously operations system perform aggregate operations average rating 
second users may known users 
case ratings closely associated reputation rater users seeking recommendations predictions may specify users generating predictions 
option requires users give privacy ratings 
third option employed grouplens uses pseudonyms uniquely identify user 
pseudonyms allows ratings associated user allows predictions customized users correlation pseudonyms 
grouplens pseudonyms associated ratings publicly available 
associate pseudonyms user real identity authentication protocol prevents user pseudonym
