syntactic bootstrapping addition organizing semantic space allow generalization side effect distinguish possible impossible form meaning mappings child continually learn new verbs 
known attempts incorporate relationship verb meaning grammatical behavior theories language acquisition 
represented pinker colleagues argue learners knowledge verb means generate syntactic privileges verb 
just discussed semantic representations developed network influence verbs combination particular patterns produce coherent output 
important understand part influences verb 
gleitman colleagues landau gleitman argued relationship form meaning may exploited opposite direction set forms verb may source knowledge verb means process called syntactic bootstrapping 
demonstrate form meaning relationships developed network underly process syntactic bootstrapping supplied novel verbs network asked interpreted 
example utterance john basket mary network computes role interpretation pattern john agent mary endpoint basket theme set verb semantics included move hand pass transfer 
direct information available concerning meaning novel verb semantic values function form verb appeared prepositional dative 
making deductions meanings novel verbs net utilizes information number sequence arguments content arguments 
second utterance object ball replaced message message mary network produces set role interpretations set semantic values verb included communicate interact express 
activation semantic values verb consequence nature object supplied 
network ability integrate multiple sources relevant information including semantics arguments simultaneously accounts behavior 

results reported suggest types procedures advocated various bootstrapping proposals subtypes general phenomenon multiple sources information influence constrain learning processing 
example standard accounts emphasized importance verb semantics generalization semantics turns insufficient explain set neighborhoods emerge network presence distribution alternation patterns input drives formation language particular semantic neighborhoods place
