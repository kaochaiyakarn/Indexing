furthermore protein includes calculus refinements flags factorisation ground reduction steps reduction steps affecting variables handled proof search regularity theory reasoning completed theories theory reasoning comes variants total partial theory reasoning 
total theory reasoning generalizes idea finding complementary literals inferences resolution semantic level 
example theory resolution foreground reasoner may select clauses literal set fa ag pass background reasoner turn discover set contradictory 
problem total theory reasoning general undecidable literals constitute contradictory set 
solution partial theory reasoning tries break big total steps manageable decidable smaller steps 
example background reasoner passed fa cg compute new subgoal return foreground reasoner 
step foreground reasoner call background reasoner fa ag detects trivial contradiction concludes chain 
protein currently offers total theory reasoning input clauses may contain call prolog predicate 
theory implicitly defined enumeration answer substitutions prolog predicate 
sake regularity means proof attempts repeat subgoal branch discarded regularity restriction relaxed case analysis variant 
assume interpreted strict ordering classification total theory extension step theory complementary set consisting exactly literal 
possible application think reasoning examples kms 
implementation partial theory reasoning currently tailored method linearizing completion bau 
linearizing completion saturation technique transforms horn clause set completed set admits resolution terminology linear unit resulting proofs unsatisfiable literal sets
