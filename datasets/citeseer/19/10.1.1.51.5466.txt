mann thompson provide precise answer questions 
compositionality discourse theories lack compositionality criterion kind mentioned previous section specific rst majority discourse theories 
follows discuss 
compositionality grosz sidner theory grosz sidner theory gst proposes discourse structure compatible essential features discussed section 
gst elementary textual units called discourse segments ds discourse structure explicitly stated tree 
discourse segment characterized primary intention called discourse segment purpose dsp 
gst identifies kinds intention relations hold discourse segments dominance satisfaction precedence 
text discourse segment ds satisfies discourse segment purpose dsp provides part satisfaction discourse segment ds includes ds said exists dominance relation ds ds ds dominates ds satisfaction dsp conditioned satisfaction dsp said dsp satisfaction precedes dsp reconsider text perspective gst 
order build discourse structure text need clear criterion determining discourse segment boundaries need clear procedure determining primary intentions pertain segments 
gst provides unambiguous solutions problems grosz hirschberg passonneau litman hirschberg nakatani passonneau litman sake argument assume 
informal analysis text produce discourse segments 
segment ds contains units gamma primary intention intend writer believe reader writer intends reader believe pressure smoke junior high greater time life 

second segment ds contains unit primary intention intend writer believe reader writer intends reader believe teens start smoking day 

third segment ds contains unit primary intention intend writer believe reader writer intends reader believe teens thought smoking 
order build discourse structure text need consider larger segments 
reasonable candidate segment dominates segments ds ds call segment ds problem create segment isomorphic problem tried put text spans rst clear primary intention segment ds 
choice take intention associated segment ds choice take associated segment ds equally valid choice take intention writer intends reader aware contrast teens behavior start smoking day beliefs held younger thought smoking 
case rst know rhetorical relations pertain large text spans related subordinated spans gst know primary intentions large discourse segments related subordinated segments 
compositionality hobbs theory hobbs theory part larger theory attempts explicit relation interpretation text events real world knowledge beliefs speaker hearer 
main difference hobbs theory discourse theories proposed nature taxonomy coherence relations 
hobbs discourse coherent talks coherent events world reflects rational structure goals relates discourse segments reader prior knowledge helps reader derive inferential relations discourse segments enabling create high level structure text 
hobbs theory consistent essential features discourse discussed section elementary units contiguous spans text coherence relations hypotactic paratactic discourse structures trees 
mann thompson grosz sidner theories hobbs provide compositionality criterion discourse structures texts 
algorithm proposes analyzing discourse top

analyst proceeds bottom fashion labelling nonterminal nodes coherence relations making explicit knowledge beliefs support assignment coherence relations nodes 
obviously intuitive nature hobbs algorithm answer compositionality related questions raised connection rst gst

contrast order traversal leaves discourse trees built rst gst yields sequence units reflects original text 
relationship coherence relations hold elementary textual units coherence relations hold larger textual spans 
compositionality polanyi theory polanyi theory pt compatible essential features discourse discussed section polanyi explicitly mentions discourse structures trees elementary units sentences discourse constituent units elementary units non overlapping pieces text 
polanyi rejects approaches discourse rely coherence relations valid structures discourse parse trees interpreted direct expression relations coordination subordination binary structures structural consequence relations hold constituent units 
main interests polanyi explain incremental processing discourse constituent units yields discourse parse tree 
polanyi assumes discourse constituent unit comes context frame encodes information needed parsing process 
information frames determine unambiguously node right frontier partial discourse tree discourse unit attached type attachment 
addition polanyi assumes attachment process modifies frame immediate mother node mother node reflect extra information added structure 
existence oracle determines unambiguously attachment nodes information inherited immediate mother nodes attachment occurs obviates compositionality principle

cases corpus rhetorical relation held units easy label ambiguous unit nucleus satellite 
consider example man ontological 
needs existential completion needs move direction completion 
direction movement determined perception truth 
consequently exist self perceived substantive developing agent exist man intuition analyzable conception say man tradition fall existence 
happens moment man loses perception moral substance nature words perceived locus intelligible necessities 
man perceives existence substance 
cue phrase consequently clearly marks causal relation units direction movement determined perception truth consequently exist self perceived substantive developing agent 
obvious unit assigned status nucleus satellite 
fact general causal relations difficult assign nuclear status cases context provides evidence respect writer intended assign important role cause result 
cases nuclearity assignment go way 
precisely taxonomy relations distinguish causal relations cause nucleus causal relations result nucleus lack objective definition allow determine relations 
problems identifying rhetorical relations holds textual units corpus analysis difficult determine rhetorical relation adequately characterize relation units 
consider example text shown 
certain badly market critics apt feel unfair dirty thoroughly criminal interplay competitive forces 
imagine market reverse things true 
try imagine market minority traders lose majority consistent profits 
profits majority take losses 
rhetorical relation best describes relationship sentences 
certain degree contrast features real market features imaginary 
time interpretation relation considered hold sentences 
choose 
choose objectively assign strength preference relations 
analysis chose label relation textual spans names rhetorical relations definitions apply
