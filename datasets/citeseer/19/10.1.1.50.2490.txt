mmr diversity reranking reordering documents producing summaries jaime carbonell language technologies institute carnegie mellon university cs cmu edu jade goldstein language technologies institute carnegie mellon university jade cs cmu edu presents method combining query relevance information novelty context text retrieval summarization 
maximal marginal relevance mmr criterion strives reduce redundancy maintaining query relevance re ranking retrieved documents selecting appropriate passages text summarization 
preliminary results indicate benefits mmr diversity ranking document retrieval single document summarization 
borne results conference evaluation summarization systems 
clearest advantage demonstrated constructing non redundant multi document summaries mmr results clearly superior non mmr passage selection 
continuing growth online information increasingly important provide improved mechanisms find information quickly 
conventional ir systems rank assimilate documents maximizing relevance user query 
cases relevant documents cases high recall necessary pure relevance ranking appropriate 
cases vast sea potentially relevant documents highly redundant extreme containing partially fully information utilize means pure relevance document ranking 
new document ranking method document ranked list selected combined criterion query relevance novelty information 
measures degree dissimilarity document considered previously selected ones ranked list

maximal marginal relevance modern ir search engines produce ranked list retrieved documents ordered declining relevance user query 
contrast motivated need relevant novelty potentially superior criterion 
approximation measuring relevant novelty measure relevance novelty independently provide linear combination metric 
call linear combination marginal relevance document high marginal relevance relevant query contains minimal similarity previously selected documents

definition mmr computes incrementally standard relevance ranked list parameter computes maximal diversity ranking documents 
intermediate values interval linear combination criteria optimized 
users wishing sample information space query set smaller value wishing focus multiple potentially overlapping reinforcing relevant documents set value closer particularly effective search strategy reinforced user study discussed start small order understand information space region query focus important parts reformulated query possibly relevance feedback larger value 
document reordering performed pilot experiment users undergraduates various disciplines 
purpose study find tell difference standard ranking method mmr 
users asked find information documents told order documents method method 
majority people said preferred method gave opinion broad interesting topics mmr 
final section asked select search method search task 
chose method mmr 
users indicated differential preference mmr navigation locating relevant candidate documents quickly pure relevance ranking looking related documents band 
users clearly discovered differential utility diversity search relevance search 
summarization consider document summarization extraction consider relevance anti redundancy 
summaries need avoid redundancy defeats purpose summarization 
move single document summarization document cluster summarization summary pool passages different possibly overlapping documents reducing redundancy significant problem 
automated document summarization dates back luhn ibm evolved efforts tipster effort includes trainable methods linguistic approaches information centric method focus anti redundancy measures 
human summarization documents called abstraction fixed length summary reflecting key points user deems important 
different user different information needs may require totally different summary document 
created single document summaries segmenting document passages sentences case mmr cosine similarity metric rerank passages response user generated system generated query 
top ranking passages original document order 
may conference featuring government run evaluation summarization systems mmr summarizer produced query relevant summaries score derived precision recall assessors making topic relevance judgements summaries 
system scored highest accuracy informative summaries assessor judged summary contained information required answer set key questions 
noted parameters summary length varied systems evaluation results indicative definitive measures comparative performance

scores see significant statistical difference scores 
explained cases summary failed pick piece relevant information reranking 
mmr passage selection method summarization works better longer documents typically contain inherent passage redundancy document sections results 
mmr extremely useful extraction passages multiple documents topics 
news stories contain repetition background information 
preliminary results multi document summarization show top passages returned news story collections response query significant repetition content retrieved passages passages contain duplicate sentences 
mmr reduces eliminates redundancy 
concluding remarks shown mmr ranking provides useful beneficial manner providing information user allowing user minimize redundancy 
especially true case query relevant multi document summarization
