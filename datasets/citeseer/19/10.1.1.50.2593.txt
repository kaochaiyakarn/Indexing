classical cryptographic protocols shared secret keys vulnerable key guessing attacks 
security keys strong difficult memorize humans 
bellovin merritt proposed encrypted key exchange eke protocols frustrate attacks 
eke requires asymmetric cryptosystems encrypting public key symmetric cipher 
novel way key exchange public keys sent openly encrypted 
contrast eke protocols public key secret key pair arbitrary protocol executions 
rsa protocol variant quite efficient practical 
compared previous protocols solid formal treatment influenced bellare rogaway key exchange protocols strong common secrets 
humans including current author quite bad memorizing large randomly generated keys 
real world people choose weak passwords short pin personal identification number 
real need cryptographic protocols give reasonable degree security weak keys

oracle pi accepted eve ask pi session key 

eve chooses oracle pi attempts guess session key 
eve chooses pair oracles pi pi faithfully conveys flow oracle call oracles pi pi related 
oracles related eve behave benign adversary adversary eve successful guesses session key accepting oracle pi having asked pi related oracle session key
