basic emotions addressing issue emotions include model drawn ideas ekman izard theorists ekman izard johnson laird oatley provided explicit models called basic primary emotions

moods affective phenomena 
number words considered emotion terms refer moods emotions irritation 
words emotion mood interchangeably psychologists alike refer certain aspects affect 
moods emotions interact important ways may differ aspects including function 
perspective cathexis differentiates moods emotions terms levels arousal 
emotions may consist high arousal specific types brain systems 
systems may activated low levels variety internal stimuli relatively weak perceptual inputs 
moods may explained low tonic levels arousal emotional systems mentioned modeled cathexis emotion proto specialists emotions explained high levels arousal systems 
high arousal emotion proto specialists tend inhibit proto specialists mild arousal may allow systems concurrently active leading chance enormous display mood states compared limited number basic emotional states 
representation consistent enormous subtleties human moods feelings 
consistent common observation moods lower threshold certain emotions emotional systems aroused happens representation moods providing potential activation emotion 
consistent observation duration moods appears longer emotions low levels arousal intensity emotion proto specialists decay slowly
