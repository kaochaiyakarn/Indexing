failing component semantic analysis 
syntactic structure may correspond dozens different semantical schemes vast number detailed relations

developing morphological analyzer finnish requires model word stem transformed different cases 
semantic analysis quantitative problem obvious different classes interpretations single syntactic structure genitive considered 
genitive may refer owning eva car having specific property john age relationship catherine husband able interpret kind relationship connected genitive structure possess detailed knowledge word actual expressions 
simplification may state genitive structure detected single rule syntactic structure making semantic analysis requires vast amount fine grained knowledge 
instance building naturallanguage database interface turned challenging task developing system machine translation mt reasonable results obtainable morphological syntactical analysis generation 
called transfer phase ambiguity may occur homonymy word having distinct meanings polysemy word having related meanings vagueness structural ambiguity transform sentence structure descriptions corresponding structures syntax trees graphs target language
