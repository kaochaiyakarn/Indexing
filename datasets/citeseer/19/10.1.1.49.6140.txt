chapter interface design consider issues related speech recognition vocabulary design voice navigation nomadic radio 
speech recognition technology speech recognition technologies today 
consider aspects speaker independence continuous recognition vocabulary size determine appropriate solution specific applications 
additional considerations selecting recognizer include performance memory barge capability os compatibility ease application integration 
template matching vs sub word analysis systems today rely matching 
set template models describing word recognized created representation speech recognized schmandt 
templates form recognizer vocabulary acting models compare spoken input 
pre processing spoken words determines word boundaries similar template selected difference minor accept word 
contrast sub word analysis represents utterance series discrete components called phonemes 
phoneme atomic particle speech smallest element sound maintain meaningful distinction human language 
recognition sub word analysis reduces auditory pattern combination noise human speech string formed letters phonetic alphabet 
system decodes message matching phonetic transcription phrases stored vocabulary 
speaker dependence vs speaker independence general template matching speaker dependent 
individual user required train system speech words vocabulary 
lengthy process may undesirable casual users application 
users wearable audio application may willing train recognizer primary users vested interest application daily basis 
sub word analysis entirely speaker independent relies phoneme representations speech 
requires explicit training user 
especially useful allowing iterative vocabulary design speech centric application 
discrete word recognition vs continuous speech template matching systems generally recognize discrete words 
phrases sentences handled treating utterance single word 
part phrase match template exactly recognition suffers 
discrete word recognition approach works dictation applications users forced provide unnatural input consisting short utterances separated distinct silences 
continuous speech recognition systems phonetic sub units words identified allowing users speak natural conversational style 
approach analyzes phrases chapter interface design identifies significant content system tolerates utterances exact match expected phrase 
users speak restricted grammar defined application 
integrating speech recognition nomadic radio voice input nomadic radio primarily browsing messages controlling high level interface actions 
application need dictation user add new words customize vocabulary 
continuous speech speaker independent recognizer preferable wish provide natural spoken interaction user need extensive training 
recognizer allows wearable application easily needed

mentioned earlier nomadic radio utilizes modeless interface unified messaging voice commands valid category 
commands move back play message preview remove message apply email voice mail news calendar events 
considerations taken designing selecting vocabulary nomadic radio selecting single word vs phrase commands stifelman single word commands due nature speech recognizer 
discrete word recognizer requires users pause words 
commands play eliminated preference simply 
nomadic radio continuous speech recognizer permits users speak longer phrase commands naturally 
commands go view provide intuitive conversational approach voice input 
addition commands reduce recognition errors shorter words difficult distinguish longer phrases 
avoiding acoustic similarity words sound similar difficult recognizer distinguish 
commands read message delete message originally easily confused recognizer 
case command delete message subsequently replaced semantic equivalent remove message 
vocabulary redesigned usage iterations select commands minimal acoustic similarity 
approach reduces errors accuracy influenced noise environment stress speaker voice 
avoiding coarticulation short phrases require users speak quickly pausing cause coarticulation 
coarticulation process pronunciation phoneme changes function surrounding phonemes schmandt 
interaction coarticulation lexical stress speaker voice causes syllables change easily 
leads vowel reduction vowel syllable shortened turned 
example commands go email remove message email remove reducing command heard chapter interface design recognizer go mail message 
commands modified longer phrases spoken naturally coarticulation effects go email remove message 
note words allow speaker slow pause naturally speaking making easier articulate phrases stress voice 
reducing vocabulary size large vocabulary size increase acoustic similarity reduce user ability recall correct commands specific task 
nomadic radio vocabulary consists message actions apply individual messages operational commands control general interface functions independent specific messages 
message actions include general commands go view move direction action message play control audio 
remaining commands operational generally frequently nomadic wake toggle sleep 
creating meta commands modifiers vocabulary size constrained making vocabulary easier users learn recall 
new actions usually added modifiers meta commands existing vocabulary
