constructing query consisting set terms descriptors iterative process 
user starting query final result strongly related 
queries worthy link 
presents method deciding link descriptors justified 
decision hinges way user moved 
order allow users different levels experience different backgrounds introduce number parameters inference process controlled 
document retrieval important world wide web searchers multitude backgrounds full spectrum experience 
person formulate query context document retrieval usually iterative process observer result slightly resembles original query 
user items strongly connected 
instance consider user uses index constructing query search process started say hobbies 
lengthy sequence visiting index entries searcher ends entry titled traditional aspects 
final entry tagged searcher relevant say relation search process 
direct relation searcher point view definitely correspondence

navigation user profile section address problem capturing searcher preferences 
size hyperindex expected user interested descriptors 
users travel small part hyperindex 
indication particular user preferences number times certain links traveled 
uninteresting parts hyperindex characterized links traveled times

activation count important element link activation count number times link activated 
searcher hyperindex time certain links traveled quite heavily corresponding high activation count frequently traveled corresponding low activation count 
viewed set descriptors destination link high activation count said fair representation searcher interest 
order compare link usage options relative number times link emanating descriptor activated normalized activation count introduced definition 
normalized activation count link originating descriptor going determined normalized activation count ranges 
special class descriptors formed descriptors destination heavily traveled links source links traveled sparsely 
indicates searcher reaches descriptor motivation continuing absent 
reasonable cause phenomenon descriptor relevant need continue searching 
shall call descriptor terminating descriptor 
definition 
descriptor called terminating descriptor link high links low 
normalized activation count link exceeds certain significance threshold say link traveled 
question happens searcher decides leave usually traveled paths starts travel traveled part hyperindex

traveling low activation count important marking seen way assign novelty value transition 
sequence traveled links reached link normalized activation count exceeds threshold cause adding link case threshold link function distance function threshold raised 
reason raising threshold need demand stronger evidence labeling outgoing link relevant

traveled link called significant normalized activation count exceeds threshold destination marked terminator mark definition 
sequence links called strongly connected link significant ik suppose sequence links strongly connected 
subsequence sequence necessarily strong connected

order statement concerning informativeness number times link traveled entropy see normalized activation count 
value interval entropy gammax log low entropy corresponds event high information value high entropy corresponds event low information value 
relatively low traveled relatively high traveled link low entropy measure allows searchers decide travel visited areas hyperindex 
note events higher information value 
amount needed evidence increases move search path threshold lowered consider entropies 
demand evidence distance starting point increases need statement concerning maximum threshold value
