document length normalization increasingly obvious past years standard smart method document length normalization cosine normalization optimally trec environment 
cosine similarity function equivalently cosine document normalization developed era documents short single topic

negative information fact large parts document related query just important positive information 
negative information longer appropriate longer full text documents retrieved

expected probability relevance document increases length

probability retrieval cosine normalized documents match increase 
fact probability retrieval remains roughly constant length bytes starts decreasing 
lnc ltc measure retrieves larger share short documents smaller number long documents 
bias short documents affects just straightforward adhoc retrieval 
massive query expansion local global approach strongly influenced bias 
half effectiveness increases approaches due indirectly overcoming bias able retrieve long documents 
local global matching improvement past tests 
local match fixed size windows explicitly non normalized 
short long documents treated equally local match making biased global match 
non biased normalization approach global match improvement due current local match reduced

effect massive query expansion bit subtle harder isolate 
consider effect adding random related relevance common terms query 
large effect short document terms occur 
long document strongly affected terms occur random chance 
long documents higher comparative similarity short documents due added terms effect counter balancing short document bias cosine normalization 
result effective similarity approach achieved combining biased approaches 
past expanding terms reaching point diminishing returns
