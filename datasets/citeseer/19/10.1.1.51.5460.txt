natural language track developed document retrieval model uses noun phrases single word terms indexing retrieval processes

experiments carried collection 
brief overview dempster shafer theory theory theory uncertainty assigns belief propositions 
particular characteristic theory belief proposition necessarily imply belief associated negation proposition gamma happens probability theory 
absence evidence support negation proposition remaining belief assigned entire proposition set represents uncertainty uncommitted belief 
full understanding theory purpose 
give necessary information understanding document retrieval model developed 
theory uses number range assign exact beliefs mutually exclusive propositions frame discernment omega gamma assignment represented basic probability assignment usually denoted omega belief values assigned sum 
belief assigned omega represents uncommitted belief 
fundamental function framework belief function 
function calculates total belief bel committed proposition available evidence expressed basic probability assignment bel contrast calculates exact belief bel calculates total belief committed noun phrase extraction part speech tagger module noun phrase extractor module extraction noun phrases collection trec queries 
tagging text document query performed followed extraction tag patterns considered noun phrases

measuring relevance query document belief function theory 
relevance document query formulated bel documents belief value zero relevance document query 
indexing proposition implies query proposition 
document collection estimated relevant documents query bel ranked belief value document ranking 
example query word wine belief value equal basic probability assigned propositions built word wine propositions table 
query noun phrase red wine belief value equal basic probability assigned propositions derived words wine red proposition table 
results results obtained considered successful 
theoretical framework supporting model sound application proposed basic probability assignments belief function lower precision belief noun phrases 
main reason words low idf values existent noun phrases 
example collection word account frequent term 
appears noun phrases belief value stand word increases 
query requests swiss account interpreted disjunction document containing noun phrase current account times retrieved high belief word swiss contained document 
happens single word query approach runs gla ds gla ds 
method solving problems noun phrase queries run 
unfortunately query approach retrieves documents containing noun phrase query 
previous example noun phrase current account retrieve documents containing retrieve documents words swiss account relevant query contain noun phrase swiss account 
brief main problem belief function model falls cases 
single word queries increases belief frequently unwanted terms irrelevant documents lowering dramatically precision 

noun phrase queries belief function specific retrieval recall gets strongly affected 
major problem document length normalisation basic probability assignment retrieval short documents
