integrating classification framework saw section simply interleave correct classification correct default reasoning lead certain arbitrariness results give problems analogous shortest path problems early approaches default inheritance reasoning 
take approach defining single theory includes classificatory reasoning default reasoning 
condition def 
formed preference map simply states preference labelling inconsistent regarding preference node preference labelling

captures initial information preferred default assumptions 
criteria clearly applicable combined classificatory default reasoning 
condition def 
says prefer assumptions associated specific specific assumptions appropriate retain unchanged 
final condition formedness condition ensuring default assumption empty independently results believe base concept 
looking starting information clearly want default assumptions regarding example default inheritance reasoning support ordering condition formedness shown labelling node earlier modified assumption

discussion shown minor change theory default inheritance gives theory combined classification default inheritance restricted terminological logic 
whilst language may restricted real applications allows obtain clearer understanding complex interaction default inheritance classification 
provides firm basis experiment addition greater expressivity 
may necessary limit expressivity terminological languages defaults tractability problems terminological languages intractable problems conceptual complexity 
certainly applications require defaults requirements expressivity limited 
approach described provides start investigating languages associated reasoning mechanisms applications
