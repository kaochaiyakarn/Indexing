section uses list framework analysing variety collaborative virtual environments general cscw systems tackle user embodiment 
design issues techniques section identify list design issues user embodiments possible techniques dealing 
indicated approach issues perspective collaborative virtual environments encourage reader consider application kinds collaborative system 
fundamental issues presence location identity 
presence primary goal body image convey sense presence virtual environment 
done automatic continuous way users tell glance 
visually oriented system vr systems involve associating user graphics objects considered represent 
location shared spaces may important embodiment show location user 
may involve conveying position orientation spatial frame ordinate system 
argue conveying orientation may particularly important collaborative systems due significance orientation everyday interaction 
example simple actions turning back loaded social significance 
consequently necessary provide body images recognisable front back regions 
identity recognising embodiment clearly key issue 
fact body images convey identity distinct levels recognition 
easy recognise glance body representing human opposed kind object 
second possible distinguish different individuals interaction don know 
third learned identity able recognise implies kind temporal stability 
fourth able find body image 
underpinning distinctions time span body conversation hours permanently potential number inhabitants environment people individual recognised 
allowing users body images important collaborative virtual environments gain widespread acceptance 
personalisation allows people create recognisable body images may help identify body image turn 
example personalisation ability don virtual jewellery 
clearly ability broader social significance conveying status associating individuals wider social group cultural dress codes fashions 
activity viewpoints body images convey sense going activity 
example position orientation data space indicate data user currently accessing 
information important ordinating activity encouraging peripheral awareness activities 
identify aspects conveying activity representing user viewpoints representing 
viewpoint represents space person attending closely related notion gaze direction visual medium 
understanding viewpoints may critical supporting interaction controlling turn conversation providing additional context interpreting talk especially spatial expressions uttered 
furthermore humans ability register rapidly changing viewpoints fine level detail tracking movement eyes moderate distances 
previous experimental domain collaborative dimensional design shown importance conveying users viewpoints 
contrast represents space person manipulating 
typically correspond location virtual limbs representing mouse image hand representing data glove 
propose user may possess multiple viewpoints 
notice deliberately separate people attending manipulating 
closely related appears reason insisting strictly synchronised real world quite possible manipulate control attending highly desirable driving car 
representing involves providing appropriate image limb driven device user employing 
representing viewpoint involves tracking user attending moving appropriate parts embodiment 
shall see systems show general body position head position eye position depending power tracking facilities 
availability degree presence related idea conveying activity idea showing availability interaction 
aim convey sense busy person achieved implicitly displaying sufficient information person current activity explicitly indicator body 
leads issue degree presence 
virtual reality introduce strong separation mind body 
words presence virtual body strongly suggests presence user may fact case mind body may popped office seconds 
particularly happen desktop screen vr minimal connection physical user virtual body 
mind body separation cause number problems social embarrassment wasted effort involved person talking empty body significant amount time 
result may important explicitly show degree actual presence virtual body 
example system track user idle time employ mechanisms increasing closing eyes suggest decreasing presence 
concrete example issue cite early experiences dive system see 
interesting aspects dive user process exits unexpectedly leaves empty graphics embodiment 
long dive session may produce particularly developing testing new applications cause confusion 
result informal conventions established dive users 
meeting stationary embodiment grabs gives shake dive allows pick people 
angry reaction tells embodiment occupied 
second bodies turn buried moved ground plane 
useful graceful mechanisms dealing problem 
gesture facial expression gesture important part conversation ranges sub conscious accompaniment speech complete formed sign languages deaf 
support gesture implies need consider kinds limbs 
facial expression plays key role human interaction powerful external representation emotion conscious sub conscious 
facial expression strongly related gesture 
granularity detail involved finer technical problems inherent capture representation correspondingly difficult 
crude possibly effective approach texture map video appropriate facial surface body image talking heads media lab 
approach involves capturing expression information human face array sensors skin modelling reproducing body image atr explicitly track movement user face combine models facial muscles skin thalmann qu au 
discussion gesture facial expression relates issue voluntary versus involuntary expression 
real bodies provide ability consciously express supplement alternative forms communication 
virtual bodies support providing appropriate set limbs strings manipulate 
flexible limbs richer gestural language 
suspect users may find ways gesturing simple limbs 
hand involuntary expression users little control important looks shock anger fear 
support technically harder requires automatic capture sufficiently rich data user 
real problem facial expression issue capture involuntary expressions 
history activity embodiments support historical awareness past presence activity 
words conveying past done 
clearly extending meaning body normal 
example carving trails pathways virtual space way worn physical world 
manipulating view people heterogeneous systems users employ equipment radically different capabilities see massive important observer able control view people bodies 
example user sophisticated graphics computer may processing power generate highly complex fully textured embodiment 
little benefit observer machine hardware texturing support 
complexity body counter productive observer forced expend valuable computing resource rendering body better render objects 
result observer able exert influence people appear selecting set possible bodies suits needs capabilities 
short propose important owner observers embodiment control appears 
requirement poses serious problem today multi user vr systems subjective variability 
current systems highly objective world view 
words observers see world albeit different perspectives 
notable exception regard system 
ability people adopt subjective world views seeing different representations embodiment represents significant challenge current vr architectures 
representation multiple media spoken mainly terms visual body images 
body images required available communication media including audio text 
example audio body images centre voice tone quality real person artificial 
text body images multi user involve text names descriptions collaborative authoring application text body limbs represented familiar word processing tools icons cursor scissors 
autonomous distributed body parts discussed virtual bodies localised small region space 
may need consider cases people places time multiple direct presence logging kind computer agent acting behalf issuing database query browsing information visualisation 
efficiency limit available computing communications resources 
result embodiments efficient possible conveying information simple ways 
specifically suspect approaches attempt reproduce human physical form full detail possible may fact wasteful approaches reflect issues simple ways may appropriate turns users relate bodies 
furthermore need support graceful degradation users powerful hardware simpler interfaces obtain sufficiently useful information overloaded 
suggests issues communication scenario 
fact real challenge embodiment prioritise issues listed section specific user application needs find ways supporting limited computing resource 
truthfulness final issue relates nearly raised 
concerns degree truth body image 
essence body image represent person physical world created entirely fancy owner 
understand consequences alternatives 
examples include truth identity people pretend people truth facial expression imagine world full perfect poker players truth capabilities body ears hear hand lying dangerous 
constraining people physical truth may limiting boring 
solution may specify gradient body attributes increasingly difficult modify 
easy require relatively little resource 
require 
example changing virtual easy changing size face voice difficult 
truthfulness may situation dependent different degrees may required different worlds applications contexts 
example simulation type vr applications may require high level truthfulness
