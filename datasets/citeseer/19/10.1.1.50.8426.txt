morris hirst showed distribution text lexical chains defined manner indicative intentional structure text sense grosz sidner

new definition centers synset 
wordnet word may synset corresponding different sense word 
look relation different words consider synsets senses word ruled looking possible connection sense word sense second 
kinds relation defined extra strong strong medium strong 
extra strong relation holds word literal repetition relations highest weight relations 
kinds strong relations illustrated 
occurs synset common words 
second occurs editions roget licensed 
line version edition available include index crucial algorithm 
age lacks vocabulary necessary processing contemporary texts especially newspaper magazine articles technical papers 
tried implement lexical chainer edition concluded possible 
horizontal link antonymy similarity see synset word 
third occurs kind link synset word word compound word phrase includes 
strong relation lower weight extra strong relation higher weight medium strong relation 
medium strong relation words occurs member set allowable paths connects synset word 
path sequence links synsets allowable corresponds patterns shown vector represents sequence links direction 
paths patterns allowed shown 
shows example medium strong relation words 
extra strong strong relations medium strong relations different weights 
weight path weight gamma path length gamma number changes direction constants 
longer path changes direction lower weight 
rationale allowable patterns follows path synsets indicative reasonable semantic proximity semantics lexical relation taken consideration 
upward direction corresponds generalization 
instance upward link apple fruit means fruit semantically general synset apple 
similarly downward link corresponds specialization 
horizontal links frequent upward downward links synset rarely 
links usually specific meaning 
horizontal link successor predecessor precursor antecedent accurate specification meaning word successor 
ensure path corresponds reasonable relation source target word rules defined patterns allowable direction may precede upward link 
link narrows context downward horizontal permitted human person person homo man human human person individual man mortal human soul successor precursor successor successor replacement successor harbinger herald precursor precursor predecessor precursor antecedent antonymy school private school school school school school school private school examples kinds strong relation words synset common horizontal link synsets link synsets word compound word phrase includes word 
double circles indicate words ellipses indicate synsets 
patterns paths allowable medium strong relations patterns paths allowable 
vector denotes links direction 
produce green goods fruit vegetable apple carrot apple carrot example regular relation words 
hypernymy hyponymy enlarge context upward link 
change direction allowed 
changes direction constitute large semantic steps 
limited 
second rule exception permitted horizontal link transition upward downward direction 
horizontal links correspond small semantic distance words heat hot linked attribute relation 
case exception second rule enables connections subordinates heat subordinates hot 
assumed enabling connection superordinates imply large semantic step 
creating managing chains lexical chain may thought set words internal structure complex
