name workshop modelling autonomous agents multi agent world maamaw envisions universe populated numerous presumably artificial agents acting interacting autonomously 
interaction produces behaviors complexity means predict need modeling effort called maamaw 
years conference founded research trends technological developments render multiagent vision invited talk maamaw 
commonplace point clich 
internet user vaguely popular press naturally anticipate autonomous agents roam net serving needs representing interests engaging agents generally interacting behalf 
role ai research part create multiagent world help understand design matter emerges 
course ability understand design enhanced degree define multiagent world regularity identify principles agents operate interact 
research maamaw workshop viewed efforts develop principles characterize properties particular multiagent worlds 
market awareness premise research past years particularly useful model constructing analyzing multiagent worlds market price systems 
argue autonomous agents market aware sense trends software business adept interacting market institutions 
computational economic reasons organizing agent interactions markets offers important advantages 
persuaded arguments expect markets prevalent multiagent worlds simply real world commerce system offers default interface artificial agents 
market rules tend generic globally standard providing applicable way interact agents approach 
ubiquity market interactions real world agents sufficient basis predict market interactions common artificial agents 
impetus market awareness naturally extends agents designers designers multiagent systems 
construction multiagent worlds requires understand implications alternate configurations alternate interaction mechanisms alternate agent behaviors 
extent agents interact markets task essentially economic analysis design 
resource focused interactions loss generality decision multiagent system really resource allocation 
making statement take broad view constitutes resource 
resources include physical materials ram wires airplanes ingredients activity time space attention expertise 
distinguishing characteristic resources consider limited 
choosing entails allocation attention activity resources thing lieu 
conversely allocation resources defines activities done done 
shared multiple resources may possible limitations extent scope sharing 
reasons resource oriented perspective 
agents described resources involved various activities 
activities usefully defined resources require value resources generate 
choose activities exclusive resource actor attention required 
general resource focused description lends structure decision problem highlighting tradeoffs alternate activities 

large share significant multiagent interactions characterized terms resources transferred agents 
describing way provides structure problem simplifying interfaces agents 
simple form interaction exchange defined directly specifying resources transferred agent 
seemingly different forms interaction agent performing task described exchange accomplishment task resource generated agent transferred second 
interaction involve exchange salient point connection centers resource mutual interest 
example physical agents colliding instance contention particular instance space resource 
characterization agent activity multiagent interactions terms resources specifying configuration resources devoted various agents respective activities time production consumption initial resources results flow resources multiagent system 
dynamic system determines outcomes activities effectively summarizes state system 
activities usefully divided categories 
agents consume resources acquiring direct value resources consumed 
agents resources produce new resources exchange mutual advantage agents 
types activities define conceptually distinct sectors multiagent system diagrammed 
basic resources agent effort raw materials initially held agents flow consumption sector production sector 
productive activities transform resources stages finished goods directly enjoyed employment consumption activities 
configuration specifying resources devoted activities called allocation 
determining resource allocation viewed problem solved multiagent system 
sector perspective lends structure problem separating resources initially exist results valued defined consumption sector done produce results resources production sector 
mechanisms method allocation determined multiagent system call multiagent interaction protocol simply mechanism 
mechanism describes communication protocol effect defining communicate message types allowed 
study allocation mechanisms properties known economics mechanism design 
mechanisms involve bilateral multilateral communication agents involved 
mechanisms may scale large numbers agents 
mediated mechanisms hand agents submit messages institution implementing mechanism part thereof 
process may iterative mechanism institution providing feedback previous messages received 
process terminates conditions prescribed mechanism rules dictate resulting allocation function pattern messages 
conceptual benefit resource allocation model interface agents rest system 
agents behavior divided realms 
participate mechanism determine available resources 
second apply resources see fit 
division complete resources fully account multiagent interaction broken significant part problem individual agents applying resources require interaction 
justify separability case specify allocation agents resources affect 
economic terminology say externalities 
mechanism design devoted alleviating problems caused externalities 
task mechanism determine allocation resulting agent message passing strategies 
designing mechanism solve allocation problems consider desirable properties outcome allocations computational issues determining allocations agent interaction protocols

standard pareto optimality efficiency 
allocation pareto optimal exist feasible allocation strictly preferred agent preferred rest 
designers multiagent systems clearly want inefficient allocation dominated effect wasting resources 
require introducing judgment relative importance satisfying various agents 
sequel remainder discuss features particular class resource allocation mechanisms market price systems 
section motivate markets enumerating benefits structuring mechanisms price system 
outline design choices relevant market systems section introduce issues bearing choices

market price systems variety mechanisms solving resource allocation problems including known examples come served allocation fiat 
defining feature market mechanism allocation mediated price system 
market price system identify distinct resource type associate numeric specification exchange terms price 
basic rule price system goods may exchanged relative prices goods involved 
example assigned price unit may exchanged units 
price system imposes constraint process getting allocation 
allocation reachable respect initial allocation price system possible reach allocation initial series exchanges ratios determined prices 
price system restrictive sense narrowing set reachable allocations basing mechanism prices numerous advantages 
mention doing complete justice underlying subtleties 
prices define common scale resource value 
consider combinations exchanges agents mechanism institutions simply relate common scale 
reduces specification values number parameters linear number goods size exchange space exponential number goods 
basic idea prices represent marginal values sufficient evaluating incremental decisions 
prices facilitate multilateral exchange bilateral exchange 
common scale values defined price system enables currency tokens price units 
turn enables complex transfers multiple goods multiple agents requiring multilateral communication serial transfers 
multilateral exchange implemented set bilateral exchanges currency original owner final owner 
bilateral exchanges generally easier arrange effective multilateral transfer 
network environments support bilateral communication primitive property significantly enhances computational viability 
prices summarize relevant information 
agent appropriate behavior multiagent system depends general agents preferences capabilities may influence relative values resources 
organizationally unrealistic assume agents know information counterparts presumably reason system decentralized computationally unrealistic ask contemplate possibilities 
prices concisely represent summary impact agents valuations providing compact specification agent local decision problem 
agent influence marginal valuation negligible agent action affect prices local behavior summary information support optimal pareto efficient decentralization 
similar conditions agent determine undertaking newly available productive activity evaluating profitability respect prices 
ygge akkermans concrete model illustrates price system effectively decentralize distributed control problem 
assertion rendered precise demonstrated particular settings

note criteria apply resource allocation mechanisms just market systems 
ffl privacy preservation 
informally mechanism preserves privacy require individuals account private information behavior 
privacy general refers degree information known specifically individual agents revealed 
equal privacy reduces ability agents gain strategic advantage reasoning manipulating beliefs 
ffl individual rationality 
mechanism individually rational agent prefer participate mechanism take initial situation result 
set allocations proper subset agents improve lot participating called core 
ffl efficiency 
mentioned pareto efficiency natural criterion evaluating outcomes resource allocation mechanisms 
ffl feasibility 
primary quality outcome allocation feasible 
allocation feasible resources assigned activities available part initially exists product productive activity assigned allocation 
feasibility may difficult ensure mechanisms distributed resource 
example agent ability produce contingent acquisition negotiations resources inherently coupled 
mechanisms manage separate negotiations provide policy cover unachievable commitments 
ffl incentive compatibility 
mechanism incentive compatible agent better acting truthfully 
desirable feature allows agent consider state simplifying task 
incentive compatibility eliminates advantage speculating agents strategies reduces cognitive burden information gathering processing costs agent 
mediator extract private information held agents mechanism determine optimal allocation respect criteria 
ffl convergence equilibrium 
mechanisms take iterative form iteration accepting messages agents announcing tentative allocation 
mechanism converges approaches particular allocation time 
allocation self enforcing sense agent choose part allocation information reported mechanism say equilibrium 
example competitive equilibrium equilibrium allocation agent gets optimal choice resource prices reported mechanism 
certain conditions competitive equilibria shown exist convergent mechanisms 
fairly general circumstances equilibrium pareto efficient 
space selecting commodities traded difficult part design process 
resource allocation problem obvious breakdown commodities 
times ways slice resources commodities clearly superior treatment 
experience developing variety computational market systems decisions space typically drive extensive chain related design decisions 
time uncertainty common set issues arises goods temporal extent systems schedule time factory cpu 
cases time resource available defining attribute 
today newspaper different week today newspaper available today different today available week 
course week newspaper available today useful 
represent variety strictly speaking need separate goods combination newspaper dated available restricting attention eliminates half cases 
reasonable approximation treat instances identically old news reducing required goods number linear time periods 
extreme simplification commonly consider single time period usually implicit address allocation resources times come 
intermediate approaches common may consider particularly important resources neglecting rest 
freewalk computational economy example agents endowed raw network resources bandwidth time period negotiate multimedia service measured quality units qos time 
depending agent current anticipated needs current anticipated prices may choose intertemporal tradeoffs services various points time 
maintain markets qos time period binary distinction current 
time slice run period model near equilibrium allocate service current allocations roll horizon forward allocations set initial conditions round 
approximate model presumably leads efficient outcomes full set temporal markets having available futures market enables beneficial intertemporal exchanges effected 
expanding period provide large share potential improvement full temporal model small fraction computational cost 
common issue uncertainty agents decisions deploying resources full knowledge outcomes activities 
cases agents may able improve welfare exchanging resources contingent resolution uncertain events 
usually introduce goods corresponding resource state nature generally suffices introduce securities state paying designated resource unit state obtains 
course may require goods prefer cover selected set important contingencies 
idea markets uncertain propositions coordinate decentralized behavior uncertainty proposed context multiagent systems hanson 
shown securities markets serve aggregate beliefs multiple agents possibly divergent information sources 
date relatively little investigation potential contingent goods general problems resource allocation uncertainty multiagent systems 
example space factory scheduling problem illustrate subtlety specification decisions consider simplified factory scheduling problem detail 
imagine factory different products instance different colored bucket seats cars 
factory may supply seats different automobile companies 
companies need seats specific times order install automobile assembly 
depending model building need different numbers seats sports car passenger car 
necessary reach strict general equilibrium period ensure feasibility current period deployed productive activities 
automobile needs complete set time produce car 
default method solving problem companies place orders seats need factory choose serve 
renegotiation handled bilaterally unrestricted protocols 
wish cast market oriented terms task design market structure 
different ways formulate space problem 
formulation adopts seat bundles primary 
wants build red offer buy bundle red seats factory 
red seats delivered today interchangeable blue seats red seats delivered tomorrow market combination seat color delivery time 
second approach treat factory time primary 
automobile companies buy time factory units time sufficient produce car seat decide color seats produce 
advantage second approach factory need decisions color seats 
disadvantage automobile companies need know factory resources go making seat 
general design decisions space implications information burdens participating agents scope markets need consider 
general market factory time factories potentially provide service variety purposes consulting single market 
general market car seats automobile companies potentially obtain seats produced variety methods different factory types needing shop factory markets 
example clear basis deciding formulation superior 
necessarily choice create markets types agents translate 
decide choice formulation may significant influence possible mechanisms determining price allocation resources 
call agents implement identity relations find generally useful smoothing operation computational markets example mapping combinations goods directly produced notional goods directly consumed 
mechanism space loss generality identify problem designing mechanism determining prices designing auction 
general definition auction see quite general 
essentially includes defined mediated protocol determines prices function messages submitted participating agents 
type protocol auction defined terms messages comprise 
full generality possible define required elements auction protocol 
actual proposed auctions include component message types 
ffl bids typically represent agent willingness engage exchange set exchanges 
example bid specify demand function indicating agents desired quantity resource function price 
ffl price quotes convey agents information state auction interim final price determination allocation 
ffl notifications inform agents results auction allocation 
typically auction reports agents terms contracts agreed 
full specification variations message types protocol parameters scope 
exploring space systematically configurable auction server michigan internet auctionbot 
provide brief elaboration issues auction design organized primary message types 
bids bids represent agent willingness exchange typically specifying quantity demanded function price 
single unit goods amounts specifying threshold price 
auction impose variety restrictions scope bids example include limited number price quantity pairs discrete units auction eecs umich edu regular form 
addition auction may restrict changes bids disallowing withdrawals decreases offer prices 
may limit agents allowed place buy sell bids auction 
long rules explicit computable function joint bid state auction enforce simply rejecting bids violate constraints 
price quotes price quotes means auction disseminates information state market 
call price quotes take form hypothetical prices agents exchange allocation determined current state 
compute quotes interpretable way auction usually just execute allocation determining clearing algorithm hypothetical mode 
quote may answer questions price auction cleared offer obtain unit state agents bids 
answer question generally called ask quote 
bid quote represents price offer sell order transact current state 
terminology comes bid ask spread commonly describe state bidding commodities organized exchanges 
chronology price quotes represents historical description state auction series particular times 
auctions may report historical information terms actual previous transactions assuming auction associated resource type meaningful history 
reporting information auctions reduce information inequality exist agents participating previous transactions 
exactly interim information revealed significant effect agents bidding strategies effects auctions 
theoretical analysis auctions explicit assumptions price quotes 
example sealed bid auctions defined eschew price quotes altogether 
limiting eliminating information revealed price quotes beneficial policy 
information bid revealed indirectly price quotes consider potential negative consequences revelation constructing bid 
similarly take account price quote revealed agents 
considerations add cognitive burden individual agents may lead inefficient outcomes attributable agents strategic behavior 
hand multiple interdependent resources auctioned agent value depends substantially prices buy sell 
case price quote essential effective coordination agent exchanges 
example tatonnement related protocols agents adjust bids goods changes prices goods 
methods reaching general equilibrium invariably rely iterative price adjustment processes 
difficult issues auction designers encourage agents participate mechanism iterative search phase making search meaningful despite reveal information 
useful approach impose activity rules usually form conditions auction participation level bidding activity 
example fcc spectrum auctions agent dropped iterative bidding process failed maintain number high bids bidding history 
notifications notifications se interesting merely report result auction process 
salient course allocation determined 
allocation determination event called clear clearing market 
auction clears preset schedule may specify particular times bidding events trigger clear 
extreme continuous auction bid trigger potential clear depending matches existing bid 
shot auction single clear typically fixed designated time 
auction clearing algorithm matches buyers sellers establishes price willing transact 
goods divisible bids take form continuous decreasing demand functions natural clearing algorithm walrasian auction calculate exact price buyer seller demands balance 
indivisible goods circumstances discontinuous demands perfect clearing prices necessarily exist 
uniform pricing algorithms establish single price transaction formed clear execute 
examples uniform pricing policies include mth st pricing rules refers number units offered sale 
policies clearing price mth st highest bids submitted counting unit buy sell 
prices reduce known second price auctions reservation prices 
vickrey demonstrated seminal auction analysis second price sealed bid auction incentive compatible respect bids buy 
st price sealed bid auction similarly incentive compatible buyers mth price auction sellers 
shown uniform price auction simultaneously incentive compatible buyers sellers 
incentive compatibility reason adopt form discriminatory pricing different agents may pay receive different prices 
fundamental reason may potential nonexistence exact uniform price mentioned 
cases discriminatory schemes may support efficient results 
may difficult enforce perception unfairness impede acceptance due care taken design
