axiomatic justification expected outcome vector 
answer 
substitution axiom applies utility functions 
apply attribute values 
substitution axiom assumes person preferences relative utility values linear probability 
utility values general linear attribute values probabilities values 
way think expected attribute values terms information lost calculation 
calculating expected value single attribute ignores decision maker attitude uncertainty 
expected value tells decision maker uncertainty value
