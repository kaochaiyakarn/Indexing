generating multi modal behavior autonomous agents deal real simulated world steve consists components implemented soar laird newell rosenbloom newell handles high level cognitive processing second handles sensorimotor processing 
cognitive component interprets state virtual world constructs carries plans achieve goals decides interact student 
sensorimotor component serves steve interface virtual world allowing cognitive component perceive state world cause changes 
monitors messages simulator describing changes state world virtual reality software describing actions taken student student position field view set objects viewing frustum speech recognition software describing student requests questions posed steve 
sensorimotor component sends messages simulator take action world virtual reality software control steve animated body text speech software generate speech 
steve high level behavior guided primary types knowledge model current task steve current plan completing task representation task initiative 
steve model task encoded hierarchical plan representation generates automatically task decomposition planning sacerdoti steve currently incorporate natural language understanding simply maps predefined phrases speech acts 
declarative domain knowledge 
task proceeds steve uses task model maintain plan complete task variant partial order planning techniques weld 
maintains record steve student currently responsible completing task task initiative change course task request student 
student task initiative steve primary role answer questions evaluate student actions 
steve answers currently just verbal 
steve follows student attaching miniaturized version body corner student field view allows steve remain student view requiring student shift attention steve objects task 
evaluating student actions steve accompanies negative feedback shake head provides positive feedback correct actions nodding head 
rationale positive feedback unobtrusive possible avoid disrupting student expect verbal comments disruptive 
steve task initiative role demonstrate perform task 
role follows plan completing task demonstrating step 
plan provides partial order task steps steve uses discourse focus stack grosz sidner ensure global coherence demonstration 
focus stack allows steve recognize resume prior demonstration unexpected events require temporary deviation usual order task steps 
steve multi modal communicative behavior arises demonstrating primitive task step action simulated world 
example demonstrate object manipulation action steve typically proceed follows 
steve moves location object needs manipulate 
cognitive component sends locomotion motor command sensorimotor component object wants move waits perceptual information indicate body arrived 

steve arrives desired object explains going 
involves describing step pointing object manipulated 
describe step steve outputs speech specification pieces information plan approach rickel allow steve initiate shifts task initiative model student knowledge 
ffl name step retrieve associated text fragment ffl steve demonstrated step allows steve acknowledge repetition choose concise verbose verbal description descriptions provided domain knowledge ffl rhetorical relation indicating relation task model step steve demonstrated generate appropriate cue phrase grosz sidner moore steve sends motor command generate speech waits event sensorimotor component indicating speech complete 

speech complete steve performs task step 
done sending appropriate motor command waiting evidence perception command executed 
example sends motor command press button waits message simulator indicating resulting state button state depressed 

appropriate steve explains results action appropriate text fragments pointing gestures 
sequence events demonstrating action hardwired steve 
steve class hierarchy action types manipulate object move object check condition type action associated appropriate suite communicative acts 
suite essentially augmented transition network atn represented soar production rules 
node atn represents high level act moving object explaining task step performing step 
arcs represent conditions terminating act 
action type class hierarchy inherits action types communicative suite action type compactly represented deviations parent suite 
currently action types inherit communicative suite general action types approach allows easily extend steve behavior suites prove inadequate new types actions encountered new domains 
representing suite atn fixed sequence acts steve demonstration action reactive adaptive transitions sensitive state virtual world state student steve object points object student field view steve says look waits student looking proceeding demonstration 
steve communicative suites similar schemata approach explanation generation pioneered mckeown mckeown 
contrast andre 
andre rist mueller employ standard top discourse planning approach generating communicative behavior animated agent compile resulting plans finite state machines efficient execution 
tradeoffs approaches discourse generation known moore 
individual nodes atn serve domainindependent building blocks steve behavior 
results set motor commands sent steve cognitive component sensorimotor component 
motor commands speak text string look move object point object manipulate object including variations press pull turn nod head agreement shake disagreement move hand neutral position manipulating pointing 
sensorimotor component implements commands decomposing messages sent simulator text speech software virtual reality software 
communicative suites provide knowledge demonstrate different types actions steve detailed behavior need scripted 
behavior general independent particular suite 
behavior generated deliberate acts cognitive component 
includes things looking waiting listening releasing conversational turn nodding head steve informed student takes appropriate action shaking head student mistake 
actions generated sensorimotor component accompany motor commands cognitive component example steve looks going looks object immediately manipulating pointing looks immediately speaking changes facial expression speaking face mouth open eyebrows slightly raised speaking 
low level behavior requires frame update implemented code linked virtual reality software includes animation steve locomotion arm movements periodic blinking slight periodic movement lips speaking tracking abilities steve gaze including varieties focus entire body look head neck glance eyes 
low level behavior takes care motion constraints example object moving steve track left shoulder moves directly point track right shoulder 
steve dialog student mixed initiative support interruptions student 
steve ability handle interruptions provided general behavior need specified communicative suites demonstrating actions 
student behavior unconstrained speak interact objects time 
steve aware student actions complete current utterance action responding 
steve gives student frequent openings telling student showing steve briefly releases conversational turn looking silence second 
behavior need specified communicative suites 
steve receives message speech recognition software student starts speaking allows steve interrupt demonstration listen student 
student utterance complete speech recognition software sends representation content steve stops listening responds 
student interacts objects steve demonstration steve may revise plan completing task 
revision may occur middle demonstrating task step example steve describing action student performs action point steve acknowledge need action continue task 
abilities handle interruptions unexpected events crucial achieving true mixed initiative interaction 
cognitive component reasons interaction student world high level abstraction sensorimotor component requires spatial knowledge virtual world 
virtual reality software provides bounding spheres objects giving steve knowledge object position coarse approximation spatial extent 
second steve requires vector pointing front object steve determines stand optionally vectors specifying direction press grasp object 
fi steve currently reproach student interruptions considering extension elliott rickel lester 
nally support collision free locomotion virtual world steve requires adjacency graph node graph represents object edge nodes collision free path directly 
sensorimotor component uses graph plan steve locomotion motor command move new object steve uses dijkstra shortest path algorithm cormen leiserson rivest identify collision free path 
detailed geometric knowledge virtual world allow steve interact precisely knowledge simple provide maintain supports critical functionality task oriented dialog 
discussion contrast prior multi modal explanation generation maybury focused mainly combining text graphics issue media allocation issue animated agents 
decision conveying information text graphics particularly difficult graphics ways 
contrast nonverbal behavior animated agent important far expressive medium 
nonverbal body language serves complement enhance verbal utterances ability replace graphics 
see cassell forthcoming deeper discussion issue 
areas nonverbal actions significantly replace verbal utterances demonstrations facial expressions 
demonstrating action may far effective trying describe perform action biggest advantage animated agent 
controlling steve facial expressions begun hope give variety different types feedback students verbal comment unnecessarily obtrusive 
important area research synchronization nonverbal acts speech level individual words syllables 
capability needed support features human conversation gestures head nods eyebrow movements highlight emphasized words 
steve current animated characters incapable precise timing andre rist mueller lester stone lester
