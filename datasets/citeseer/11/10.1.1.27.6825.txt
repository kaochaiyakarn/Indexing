linearity fi triangle inequality argument just fi sigma omega know right hand side fact triangle inequality get opposite inequality 
norm defined infimum sum norms decompositions 
infimum realized decomposition inequality know right hand side infimum realized sequence decompositions right hand sides converging infimum fi sums infimum 
cases fi fi contractive 
show ff contractive need fact symmetrization affects norms 
suppose banach space 
omega omega omega 
claim omega omega clearly decomposition omega omega omega realizing infimum definition norm done 
suppose decomposition sigma omega omega omega sigma omega omega consider expression sigma omega gamma omega omega computing norms triangle inequality get omega sigma omega gamma omega sigma omega kk words simple arithmetic omega kk sigma omega contradicts assumption 
symmetrization preserves norms 
clear argument carried symmetrization elements 
map ff just undoes symmetrization pure tensors ff norm preserving 
consider arbitrary element omega 
ff sigma ffh sigma ff sigma sigma ff contractive 
immediately follows morphism omega 
omega morphism satisfies necessary properties
