detecting session boundaries web user logs school computer mathematical sciences robert gordon university aberdeen ab hg scotland scms ac uk ker school computer mathematical sciences robert gordon university aberdeen ab hg scotland scms ac uk detecting session boundaries web important reasons 
firstly important establish common context various statistics relating user sessions frequency user activities 
specifically important detect boundaries order group related information applications learning techniques adaptive search engines 
date notion session web consistently defined 
tendency group log data available user ip address umbrella session regardless length time covered logs 
tendency lacks user oriented view 
argument session web defined group user activities related evolving information need close proximity time 
describe discuss investigation web transaction logs excite altavista view structuring activities sessions units subsequent user oriented learning techniques 
describes methodology experiments performed followed results discussions 
results point minute threshold user activities appropriate session interval 
implications limitations results differences traditional ir systems discussed 
motivation discussing information retrieval process focus individual stages formulating queries searching document collections presenting set returned documents 
cases need go boundaries individual stages consider cycles stages 
research shows nearly users conducted ir search information problem 
research referred process repeatedly searching time relation specific possibly evolving information problem defined successive search phenomenon 
study described investigates subset phenomenon groups sequences activities related evolving information need deeper conceptual level close proximity time 
intend group activities refer session 
activities refer search related actions take place course information retrieval 
include forming query precisely search statement browsing results providing relevance judgements 
session quite defined superficial level context user human intermediary library 
typically starts dialogue user intermediary ends think little misleading refer activities queries 
creates confusion initial search statement browsing activities example 
forming modifying search statement referred query 
dialogue ends 
dialogue may variety reasons 
user finds documents pointers documents looking user receives feedback information time constraint involved 
session clear meaning online search system user login logout facilities 
session case starts time user performs login finishes logout 
different web 
rapid expansion internet great variety information retrieval tasks performed web search engines 
web search usually involve human intermediary fact usually official login logout access search engines clear exactly unit session system oriented definition perspective 
studying users interactive systems difficult studying users web difficult 
special browser information available retrieval process user information need web search traditional library search 
queries short users potentially accessing search engine world point time variety methods difficult identify user activity 
better collect information group activities session query 
important preconditions session identified 
aim investigation 
previous research frequent users bibliographic information retrieval system usually subject matters search 
web users different number subject matters topics unreasonable assume searches tend clustered interests requirements consciously unconsciously 
view user interest particular topic acting particular role anticipate user activities session correspond role 
claim reasonable particularly retrieval process viewed interactive problem solving task particular goal 
connections roles contexts different user information needs open question reasonable think contextual connections different searches user acting role 
contextual information search helpful subsequent searches long role 
summary benefits having sessions identified web searches see section description sessions web queries tend short simple structure generally help human intermediary 
probably difficult identify role query 
know ensure session particular unit corresponds role role identification particular query helped queries session 
useful know queries user 
knowing certain queries web session safely presume belong user 
sessions types web user studies modelling learning web surfing patterns common framework sessions statistics useful 
remaining parts describe discuss investigations web transaction logs tls view structuring transactions sessions units subsequent user oriented learning techniques 
firstly related described methodology study experiments performed study 
followed 
related studies web navigation activities logs spanning long periods time weeks indicate users visit web site 
idea call timeout divide discusses subject matters perspectives 
pragmatic view refers 
page accesses user individual sessions 
timeout time adjacent activities 
catledge pitkow minute timeout user experiments 
reasons choosing particular amount timeout clear users navigation patterns may changed years 
importantly catledge pitkow users navigation behaviour include activities web search engines 
web tl analysis users retrieval activities explicitly implicitly studies group activities user registered ip number unit referred session 
time period logs cover vary hours day days months 
appropriateness grouping activities session debatable particularly time span large 
additionally argue final cut point tls usually arbitrary tls just split different batches 
methodology point clarify referring term session concerned detecting meaningful unit activities boundaries groups activities intention learning technique 
mind start session points role query changes 
identification sessions straightforward role query activity known 
automatically identifying role difficult task requires information background query session 
identification session done information 
activities session share role conceptual level close terms generation time 
time gap adjacent activities session think gap usually smaller activities different sessions 
time span called session interval defined advance threshold 
adjacent activities counted different sessions time exceeds threshold 
identification session boundaries delimiters effectively process examining time gap activities number occurrences comparing session interval 
ideally session contain activities role 
respect optimal session interval large larger gap higher risk grouping activities different roles results correctness role information queries reduced 
having small session interval problems essentially information available role particular point time

types errors type error browsing activities search statement allocated different sessions 
type error adjacent non browsing activities related search statements short time interval allocated different sessions 
type error unrelated searches allocated session 
type error type error results selecting tight session interval type error result loose session interval 
type error vague sense time interval 
open question short time interval reasonable 
considering consequences types errors type error serious purpose role predication invalid 
type information suitable learning data 
having errors invalidate method detecting sessions time intervals 
errors indicate people behaviour irregular method aiming covering cases time probably 
time interval method aims handling cases time may achieved careful considerations optimal session interval 
experiments analysing session cut errors order examine results selecting optimal session interval need experiments analyse session cut errors 
aim experiments examine percentages errors acceptable range 
type error easily identified logs 
example excite logs relations exist activity session activity immediately session type error identified sessions queries user id queries query terms 
reuters logs relations exist activity session activity immediately session type error identified sessions queries ip address activities ip address happening short time assumed user queries query terms query browsing activity sessions day arguable include criterion 
find activities satisfying criteria happened different days 
rare treated special case 
obvious query modifications adding removing words connection seemingly unrelated queries 
domain specific common sense knowledge required judgement occasionally 
task recognising type related non browsing activities cut type error unrelated non browsing activities cut straightforward recognising type error 
queries checked manually establish related type type errors identified automatically experimenting different session intervals 
guarantee possible errors detecting session boundaries removed 
terms priorities firstly error total type small possible 
secondly view type errors damaging cause session intervals minimise type error preferred 
argued detecting session boundaries web important 
problematic assume activities user ip address session especially logs covering days months 
sessions provide common ground various statistics relating user activities 
provide possibility regulating incremental learning building intra inter adaptive systems web 
essential session boundaries established solid ground empirical evidence 
discussions experiments analysing sets web logs excite logs reuters logs 
experiments various session intervals results show optimal session interval regard likelihood belonging role range minutes minutes 
aim show methodology deriving reasonable session breaks web queries order better investigate effectiveness learning techniques web 
possible learning take place particular point session query relevance feedback long information learning purpose 
emphasis fact need meaningful session boundaries learning techniques better exploit boundaries 
session boundaries provide initial cut learning sessions split necessary 
summary provide common terminology discussing sessions mechanism obtaining optimal session interval 
suggest record additional information facilitate research web user search activities 
beneficial know users activities returned documents 
example returned documents documents selected users ranking information selected documents 
web search logs provide information analysis web users easier results accurate
