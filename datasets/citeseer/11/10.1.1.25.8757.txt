techniques araneus order correlate tabular data generate integrated views 
commercial database systems see example provide functionalities automatic generation pages 
mainly allow generating single page time containing set database tuples usually skeletons pages kept inside database pages contain specific html tags specify order fill page sql query run database query executed resulting table inserted body page returned user 
language penelope described generate hypertext database content 
issue hypertext structure addressed commercial products 
adm logical data model web hypertexts araneus data model adm variant odmg specifically tailored web context 
say page oriented sense recognizes central role pages play framework 
web page considered object identifier url set attributes 
introduce notion page scheme resembles notion relation scheme relational databases class object oriented databases model sets homogeneous pages 
attributes page may simple complex type 
simple type attributes correspond essentially text images links pages 
attributes web pages contain collections objects multivalued attributes 
model lists tuples 
component types lists turn multivalued nested lists may arise 
noted chosen lists multivalued type repeated patterns web pages physically ordered 
specific aspects framework counterpart traditional data models 
important construct web pages represented forms 
forms execute programs server dynamically generate pages 
adm provides form type essentially considered virtual list tuples tuple attributes fill fields form plus link resulting page lists virtual tuples stored page correspond submissions form 
second usually site includes pages special role unique sense pages structure 
typically home page site falls category 
sake homogeneity model pages means page schemes 
example db lp bibliography server provides page search specific author name page unique page site structure 
essential feature page form searching author database specifying string corresponding name author list publications author returned 
see form virtual list tuples attributes text entered string search second link page generated corresponding search tuple associates result page search keyword tuples list directly accessed built sense keyword specified order generate result page 
constructs model due semi structured heterogeneous nature web data optional attributes allow describe pages missing features adm provides heterogeneous union type appropriate context traditional class inheritance 
consider page db lp bibliography server search author database 
search form involved behavior string specified database author names searched single name matching query string author page publications returned contrary query string matches names different page containing list matching names links corresponding pages returned 
union essential model behavior page url www informatik uni trier de ley db indices tree index html case say form returns link type union different page schemes author pages name index pages 
page containing publications leonardo da vinci define notion adm scheme set page schemes 
represent scheme directed multigraph nodes scheme graph page schemes unique page scheme diagrammatic representation denoted single page non unique page schemes represented stacks pages edges denote links 
fragment db lp bibliography server scheme shown contains explanation symbols 
consider example page scheme corresponds pages referring fictional publications author leonardo da vinci 
author site similar page pages share structure 
corresponding page scheme attribute name plus multivalued attribute worklist containing list publications turn set nested tuples 
note choose model information publications extract title conference journal published year list authors author report name link corresponding page site link optional authors 
choose slightly redundant representation sense extract string containing names authors 
advantages terms querying site allowing pose conditions author names done page scheme possible descriptions information page reflecting user personal view site adapted basis efficiency needs 
citation contains link corresponding conference journal page pages conferences journals different structure union type model link 
note see actual pages site instances page scheme need access html source apply suitable text restructuring procedures 
attribute values extracted html source editor language formalism text manipulation 
current implementation wrap pages java classes page scheme site corresponds specific class method attribute method implements editor program accesses html source returns complex value attribute 
perspective instance level site seen graph links connect trees corresponding pages 
fact instance page scheme tree nested structure may contain links instances 
nodes trees graph essentially tuples tuple attribute may simple value root subtree optional attributes may null value 
worth noting approach generalizes models adopted query languages web pages considered essentially unstructured objects 
fact show possible model web adm scheme discuss ask general queries retrieve documents web mentioning java ulixes :10.1.1.11.3892:10.1.1.145.2594
shows approach highly scalable fact model little structure

ulixes defining relational views web section ulixes language definition relational views web 
ulixes designed simple flexible language extracting data web adm scheme 
data extraction process notion navigation site 
navigations ulixes expressed navigational expressions path expressions denoting paths site graph 
perspective site offers essence set navigations pages site navigations allow follow links different pages explore hierarchical structure page represent natural means query page 
consider example scheme 
suppose interested reaching author pages site 
start author search page url known submit empty form reach search result page index authors site instance page scheme author corresponding page reached associate link 
navigations site pages site relatively small number different types fact order reduce design maintenance costs large sites tend reduce amount heterogeneity pages trying gain structure 
specified navigational expression dot operator denotes navigations inside pages link operator 
follow links submit semantics expression interpreted possible paths site obtained starting unique instance page scheme submitting empty form traversing reaching 
navigations represented tuple values value attribute associated nodes navigation navigational expression represented relation relational model sense 
ideas associate relation set tuples navigational expression 
navigational expression call sem corresponding relation 
assume attributes suitably renamed needed 
relational nature navigations definition relational views adm schemes directly navigational expressions 
define table statement purpose form define table bn relation name bn attributes ii adm scheme iii navigational expression iv attributes sem set conditions attribute values 
formal semantics statements :10.1.1.145.2594
example suppose interested authors titles papers leonardo da vinci vldb conferences 
generate relation statement define table authors title submit worklist worklist authors worklist title worklist name leonardo da vinci worklist vldb expression essentially giving name relation corresponding navigational expression submit worklist resulting relation includes subset attributes listed clause authors title selected papers 
things note respect example navigation data filtered conditions clause paths vldb conference considered 
clause fill form completely transparent way specifying name attribute form equal leonardo da vinci 
note navigational expression require submit link returns page scheme selecting possibilities union type 
language specific mechanisms dealing union types page returned correct type navigates simply returns empty result 
penelope generating derived hypertexts approach discussed previous section interesting considered extraneous web framework users access information navigating hypertexts 
extend view paradigm way data retrieved user hypertext 
show relational views transformed back web hypertexts pages structure appear existing site 
order reach goal introduce penelope allows definition new page schemes data organized 
illustrate process means example 
suppose ulixes navigate site build table containing tuple form authors title year leonardo da vinci 
new page schemes organize papers year want re organize papers dividing basis year publication 
year table generate page containing list papers published author year unique page containing list years created provide access year pages 
need restructured scheme described page schemes called 
structure pages defined define page statements 
note attributes source table enclosed angle brackets 
define page url url year year text year worklist list authors text authors title text title text link union define page unique url result html list year text year link url year statements generate html code new pages 
statement defines page scheme attribute year multivalued attribute corresponding list papers leonardo published year 
page created different year clearly urls pages generated system time page created new different url needed 
function terms generate urls fact term url year 
specifies system generate url page scheme url uniquely associated year value 
define page statement describes pages filled starting attributes relation 
example definition attribute year type text page scheme specifies values come attribute year relation 
second statement defines unique page scheme multivalued attribute corresponding list years note case local constant url result html assigned corresponding instance 
declare page scheme unique indicate single url assuming unique page generated statement 
page item year list linked corresponding year page value link function term generate urls years pages url year 
note want access corresponding conference journal page 
re create pages derived hypertext access original site 
link pages urls existing pages values attribute table extracted ulixes 
essence languages generate hypertext new pages offering different perspective data plus existing portion original site 
define page statements ideas 
local urls identify new pages constant strings strings built function symbol url attributes relations 
example result html constant local url url year 
denotes local url built values attribute year 
define page statement form technique similar skolem functors invent new oid object oriented databases
