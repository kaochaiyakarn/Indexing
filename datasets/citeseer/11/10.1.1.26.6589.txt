experiments muc terrorism domain created dictionary extraction patterns performed comparably dictionary created autoslog preclassified texts input 
motivation vast amount text available line offers new possibilities bottleneck lurking underneath natural language processing nlp systems 
systems rely text corpus manually tagged way 
example brown corpus francis kucera penn treebank corpus marcus santorini marcinkiewicz widely manually annotated part speech syntactic bracketing information 
part speech tagging syntactic bracketing relatively general nature corpora different natural language processing systems different domains 
systems rely text corpus manually tagged domain specific task specific manner 
example corpus approaches information extraction generally rely special domainspecific text annotations 
consequently manual tagging effort considerably cost effective annotated corpus useful type nlp system domain 
corpus approaches information extraction demonstrated significant time savings conventional hand coding methods riloff 
time required annotate training corpus nontrivial expense 
reduce bottleneck developed system called autoslog ts generates extraction patterns untagged text 
autoslog ts needs preclassified corpus relevant irrelevant texts 
inside texts needs tagged way 
generating extraction patterns tagged text related years systems developed generate patterns information extraction automatically 
previous systems depend manually tagged training data sort 
dictionary construction systems autoslog riloff requires tagged noun phrases form annotated text text associated answer keys 
kim moldovan similar spirit autoslog requires manually defined frames including keywords semantic hierarchy associated lexicon 
competing hypotheses resolved referring manually encoded answer keys available asking user 
crystal soderland generates extraction patterns annotated training corpus 
crystal relies domain specific annotations plus semantic hierarchy associated lexicon 
liep huffman system learns extraction patterns relies predefined keywords object recognizers identify people companies human interaction annotate relevant sentence event type 
cardie cardie hastings hastings lytinen developed lexical acquisition systems information extraction systems learned individual word meanings extraction patterns 
systems semantic hierarchy sentence contexts learn meanings unknown words 
autoslog autoslog riloff dictionary construction system creates extraction patterns automatically heuristic rules 
input autoslog needs answer keys text noun phrases extracted labeled domain specific tags 
example terrorism domain noun phrases refer perpetrators targets victims may tagged 
tagged noun phrase original source text autoslog identifies sentence noun phrase appears 
sentence annotation indicate appropriate autoslog chooses 
autoslog invokes sentence analyzer called circus lehnert identify clause boundaries syntactic constituents 
autoslog needs flat syntactic analysis recognizes subject verb direct object prepositional phrases clause parser 
autoslog determines clause contains targeted noun phrase applies heuristic rules shown 
pattern example subj 
passive verb victim 
murdered subj 
active verb perp 
bombed subj 
verb 
perp 
attempted kill subj 
aux noun victim 
victim passive verb dobj 
killed victim 
active verb dobj 
bombed target 

dobj 
kill victim 
verb 
dobj 
tried attack target 
gerund dobj 
killing victim 
noun aux dobj 
victim 
noun prep np 
bomb target 
active verb prep np 
killed instrument 
passive verb prep np 
aimed target 
autoslog heuristics rules divided categories syntactic class noun phrase 
example targeted noun phrase subject clause subject rules apply 
rule generates expression defines conceptual role noun phrase 
cases assume verb determines role 
rules recognize verb forms active passive principle passive verbs direct objects 
included pattern circus occasionally confused active passive constructions 
tive 
extraction pattern created instantiating rule specific words matched sentence 
rules ordered satisfied generates extraction pattern longer patterns tested shorter ones 
example consider sentence ricardo mayor kidnapped yesterday 
suppose ricardo tagged relevant victim 
autoslog passes sentence circus identifies ricardo subject 
autoslog subject heuristics tested subj 
passive verb rule fires 
pattern instantiated specific words sentence produce extraction pattern victim 
kidnapped 
texts pattern activated verb kidnapped appears passive construction subject extracted victim 
autoslog produce undesirable patterns variety reasons including faulty sentence analysis incorrect pp attachment insufficient context 
person manually inspect extraction pattern decide ones accepted ones rejected 
manual filtering process typically fast 
experiments muc terrorism domain took user hours review extraction patterns riloff 
manual filtering process part knowledge engineering cycle generating annotated training corpus substantial bottleneck 
generating extraction patterns untagged text tag tag 
generating annotated training corpus significant undertaking time difficulty 
previous experiments autoslog suggested took user hours annotate texts riloff 
take roughly week construct training corpus texts 
committing domain expert knowledge engineering project week prohibitive short term applications 
furthermore annotation task deceptively complex 
autoslog user annotate relevant noun phrases 
constitutes relevant noun phrase 
user include modifiers just head noun 
modifiers just relevant modifiers determiners 
noun phrase part conjunction user annotate conjuncts just 
user include appositives 
prepositional phrases 
meaning simple nps change substantially prepositional phrase 
example bank boston different bank toronto 
real texts loaded complex noun phrases include variety constructs single 
question tag 
user tag person 
ones 
difficult specify convention reliably captures desired information specifying convention produce inconsistencies data 
avoid problems developed new version autoslog called autoslog ts require text annotations 
autoslog ts requires preclassified training corpus relevant irrelevant texts domain 
preclassified corpus easier generate user simply needs identify relevant irrelevant sample texts 
furthermore relevant texts available line applications easily exploited create training corpus autoslog ts 
autoslog ts autoslog ts extension autoslog operates exhaustively generating extraction pattern noun phrase training corpus 
evaluates extraction patterns processing corpus second time generating relevance statistics pattern 
process illustrated 
concept node dictionary sentence analyzer concept node rel bombed bombed killed saw autoslog heuristics stage stage killed bombed bombed saw concept nodes bombed bombed preclassified texts sentence analyzer world trade center bombed pp terrorists preclassified texts autoslog ts flowchart stage sentence analyzer produces syntactic analysis sentence identifies noun phrases 
noun phrase heuristic rules generate pattern called concept node circus extract noun phrase 
autoslog ts uses set ideally irrelevant texts near texts similar relevant texts 
heuristic rules original rules autoslog plus subj 
active verb dobj infinitive prep np 
additional rules created business domain previous experiment probably important experiments described 
significant difference autoslog ts allows multiple rules fire matches context 
result multiple extraction patterns may generated response single noun phrase 
example sentence terrorists bombed produce patterns extract terrorists subj 
bombed subj 
bombed 
statistics reveal shorter general pattern longer pattern needed reliable domain 
stage giant dictionary extraction patterns literally capable extracting noun phrase corpus 
stage process training corpus second time new extraction patterns 
sentence analyzer activates patterns applicable sentence 
compute relevance statistics pattern 
specifically estimate conditional probability text relevant activates particular extraction pattern 
formula pr relevant text text contains pattern rel gammaf req total gammaf req rel gamma freq number instances pattern activated relevant texts total gamma freq total number instances pattern activated training corpus 
sake simplicity refer probability pattern relevance rate 
note patterns activated relevant texts domain specific 
example general phrases reported appear sorts texts 
motivation conditional probability estimate domainspecific expressions appear substantially relevant texts irrelevant texts 
rank patterns order importance domain 
autoslog ts exhaustive approach pattern generation easily produce tens thousands extraction patterns reasonably expect human review 
ranking function order person needs review highly ranked patterns 
rank extraction patterns formula relevance rate log frequency relevance rate case function returns zero pattern negatively correlated see riloff detailed explanation 
domain assuming corpus relevant 
formula promotes patterns high relevance rate high frequency 
important high frequency patterns considered relevance rate moderate say expressions killed occur frequently relevant irrelevant texts 
patterns highest relevance rates promoted crucial expressions buried ranked list

reasons difference 
current experiments done version circus process conjunctions semantic features 
autoslog semantic features create extraction patterns incorporated selectional restrictions patterns 
example extracted victims satisfy human constraint 
semantic features current experiments technical reasons undoubtedly improved precision dictionaries 
previously reported scores umass muc system included discourse analyzer domain specific rules distinguish terrorist incidents events 
circus designed extract potentially relevant information local context assumption complete system contain discourse analyzer global decisions relevance 
scenes informative look scenes try understand autoslog achieved slightly better recall autoslog ts achieved better precision 
autoslog additional recall came low frequency patterns buried deep ranked list 
main advantage annotations provide guidance system easily hone relevant expressions 
corpus tagging mercy ranking function 
believe ranking function job pulling impor tant patterns top additional research needed recognize low frequency patterns 
fact reason believe autoslog ts ultimately capable producing better recall autoslog generated patterns autoslog 
autoslog ts produced patterns relevance rate frequency

directions previous results suggest core dictionary extraction patterns created reviewing patterns 
specific number patterns need reviewed ultimately depend breadth domain desired performance levels 
potential problem autoslog ts undoubtedly useful patterns buried deep ranked list cumulatively substantial impact performance 
current ranking scheme biased encouraging high frequency patterns float top better ranking scheme able balance needs effectively 
precision extraction patterns improved adding semantic constraints long run creating complex extraction patterns 
autoslog ts represents important step making information extraction systems easily portable domains 
autoslog ts system generate domain specific extraction patterns automatically annotated training data 
user needs provide sample texts relevant irrelevant spend time filtering labeling resulting extraction patterns
