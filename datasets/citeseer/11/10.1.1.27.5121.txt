requirements xml query language prior introducing features xml gl propose set requirements design query language xml documents 

language flexible allow query formulation valid wellformed documents 
availability dtd result facilitation expressing evaluating query xml gl 

want address queries web site account links different documents querying document time 

want possibility access dtds xml metadata proposed rdf draft standard proposal data query paradigm 

want extract information xml document means powerful declarative pattern matching element manipulation primitives 

want reshape source xml documents specifying new links existing elements new elements xml document resulting query 
process requires new tags result document 

want specify regular expressions paths possibility recursively arbitrarily long paths site possibly specifying conditions path nodes 
feature particularly helpful case search directed certain document patterns may placed arbitrarily xml source 

want support arbitrary computations numeric content documents means built functions 

xml positional may want allow order sensitive query interpretation relative order appearance xml tags character data meaningful 
interpretation may overly restrictive query language offer unordered interpretation probably default 

query interpretation xml gl able compute approximate results similar ones fully satisfy queries 

want queries language readable dtd result query immediately apparent 
xml gl data model query languages semi structured data rely data models notations representing organization data 
data models define data schemas actual data organizations 
difference structured semi structured data tuples relational database obey explicit data schema may partial schema schema html page head body content may different structure page page 
xml permits representation structured semi structured data 
hand provides notion similar data schema express organization documents xml document compliant document type definition dtd specifies types markup elements appear document attributes containment relationships 
xml document adheres dtd said valid 
hand xml documents need valid lack dtd respect syntactic rules tag placement said formed 
xml directly assumed data model query language 
includes document oriented features different classical database style data models safely abstracted away definition query language 
coherence visual nature xml gl introduce explicit data model xml documents called xml graphical data model represent expected structure xml documents dtds actual documents 
xml gdm syntax additional graphic notations writing xml gl queries representing dtd result benefit reducing minimum notations user learn query xml documents 
formed documents dtd queried way valid documents information structure document available query formulation time queries may match exactly structure document result empty answers 
flexibility definition data model query language may alleviate problem querying documents dtd allowing syntactically different semantically equivalent representations information leveraging data query transformation techniques improve response imprecise queries
