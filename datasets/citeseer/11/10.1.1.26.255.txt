motivation distributed computing environments distributed computing environments research collaborations spanning institutions may independent geographically dispersed individuals authority control access resources 
wish provide automated system allow stakeholders assert authority resource flexible manner consistent scope authority 
immediate motivation enable sharing open networks valued resources scientific community generally distributed doe project particular

document report lbnl resources consist large scientific instruments electron high energy light sources supercomputers high compute servers large scale storage systems 
researchers groups may contribute software data shared members group 
owners software data want able securely store data software hardware owned entity 
owners hardware resources want able control uses 
stakeholders may want share members collaboratory 
example commercial members may want common compute hardware share data results members organization 
environment requires stakeholders able enforce access policy resources resources physically controlled different administrative domain 
stakeholder willing trust resource server enforce access control stakeholder able flexibly specify access requirements resources 
traditionally stakeholders relied access control lists acls stored resource server express access policy 
acls typically require central administrator changes means administrator trusted stakeholders administrator potentially bottleneck rapid updating policy 
acls usually require server domain maintain accounts administrative support stakeholders users 
problems exacerbated stakeholders users administratively geographically remote server 
problem arises distributed research environments may multiple principals different administrative domains need input access control policy single resource 
attempted execution proprietary code large scientific modeling program owned third party remote supercomputer example multi ply controlled resource 
owner supercomputer may want restrict amount run time allotted user author code may want specify may run code 
getting permission run code requires satisfying separately administered policy requirements 
multiple layers management may wish impose independent restrictions large scientific instrument 
example top level administrators may general restrictions nationality membership organization safety officers may require special training principal investigator may set requirements project scheduled time instrument 
scenarios resource data instrument computational storage capacity multiple stakeholders stakeholder impose conditions access called conditions resource 
met simultaneously order satisfy requirements access 
common principals scientific collaborations geographically distributed multi organizational 
reliable widely deployed easily administered access control mechanisms feasible administer secure collaborative environment 
access control mechanism allow secure distributed management policy access resources provide transparent access authorized users strong exclusion unauthorized users operating environment stakeholders users system resource administrators may meet face face 

goal policy access control want access control mechanism support computer working environment sort distributed authority resources group endeavors 
stakeholder able assertions signing policy statement mediator especially centralized system administrator act behalf 
mechanism dynamic easily concerned stakeholders users maintaining strong assurances 
solution scale number stakeholders resources users 
specifically access control mechanism able collect relevant assertions identity stakeholder conditions corresponding user attributes unambiguous access decision requiring absolute minimum centrally administered configuration information 
policy decision resource server able ensure compliance part intended users unauthorized parties 
mechanism evolve emerging commercially supplied public key certificate infrastructure components 

approach certificate distributed security approach policy access control distributed environment digitally signed documents certificates convey identity authorization attributes 
digital signature assert document validity physical presence signer physical possession documents signed author handwriting 
result digitally signed documents provide assertions stakeholders resource assertions trusted authorities attributes user may generated represented verified independent time location 
users authenticated presenting identity certificate proving know associated private key 
certificates issued certificate authorities ca verify connection person system component possession public key private key pair 
stakeholders create digitally sign condition certificates define conditions satisfied user access resource 
user attributes asserted authorities provide assured information digitally signed attribute certificates 
condition attribute certificates may stored local issuer long provided server needed determine permissions access request 
components enable certificates include reliable mechanisms generating distributing verifying digitally signed documents mechanisms match conditions attributes decide access allowed access methods enforce policy specific resource access control decision 
mechanisms rely public key cryptography digital signatures publickey infrastructure certificate management protocol secure authenticated communication secure sockets layer protocol ssl

naming resources issue needs addressed 
model assumes resources may form hierarchy file system tree web documents

urls resources corba object names context orb non obvious feature conditions 
conditions general access resource specified enable access access conjunction actions read write 
condition specifies access user satisfy gaining access resource 
feature allows stakeholders exercise veto power subtree resources

certificate placing group get additional access 
note identity certificates place separate attribute certificate attest user values selected components dn organization organizational unit common name 
conditions evaluated user access determined 
access satisfied assert negative conditions country take precedent deny access positive ones may add rights
