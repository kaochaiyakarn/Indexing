teletraffic theory practice traditional telephony highly static nature conventional defined notion limited variability trademark homogeneous systems talk typical users generic behavior averages describe system performance adequately 
important reason special appeal widely models engineering community mainly simplicity physical interpretation practical relevance required inputs readily estimated practice 
static nature traditional contributed popular belief existence universal laws governing voice networks significant presumed poisson nature call arrivals links network traffic heavily aggregated inter office trunk groups 
law states call arrivals mutually independent call interarrival times exponentially distributed parameter equivalently denotes number call arrivals successive non overlapping time intervals length deltat increment process poisson process parameter random variables independent identically distributed gamma deltat deltat 
traffic models poisson process full dynamics described just parameters termed parsimonious highly desirable property reasons develop 
poisson law remained valid modeling purposes years 
related invariant pots traffic specifies call holding times durations follow exponential distribution 
important teletraffic laws growth rates highly predictable allowing fine tuned short long term capacity planning network controls operations fully centralized envision advantage information network global state offered services strictly regulated monitored 
hand static pstn environment resulted steady decline perceived importance continued measurements emphasized need analytical techniques 
teletraffic theory originally empirical studies traffic measurements collected laboriously public telephone networks soon belief poisson process exponential distribution universal laws pots overcame curiosity associated collecting analyzing data 
new mathematical results provided sound physical basis observed poisson nature call arrivals trunk groups 
example palm khintchine theorem states superposition independent properly normalized renewal processes describing call arrivals single phone line forms poisson process 
resulting traffic models general mathematically tractable predict accurately performance measures interest 
queueing theory born 
faith true traffic models took need traffic measurements glossed main focus shifted turning queueing theory full fledged mathematical discipline 
ironically engendered mathematical elegance particularly success changes static world telephony 
year old patterns telephone teletraffic modeling success story greatly undermined major new uses telephone network 
changes began advent faxes continued drastic popularity web 
key change telephone calls fax transmission internet access statistical characteristics dramatically different typical voice call 
tend significantly longer variable duration voice call numbers increased dramatically especially terms internet access calls 
types calls playing havoc existing pstn engineering infrastructure designed deal voice calls 
places call blocking increased unacceptable levels especially late evening hours popular web surfers ad hoc engineering methods necessary prevent temporarily internet access calls saturating access public telephone network 
clearly theory longer meets reality result capacity planning inexact concentrated industry wide efforts loading internet traffic pstn way 
goodbye poisson expect voice network modeling success story enjoy triumph applied data networks attempted 
fact voice traffic modeling proven pioneering erlang palm wilkinson half century ago 
short disastrous applied data networks simple profound reason rules change computers humans doing talking 
voice traffic property relatively homogeneous predictable signaling perspective spans long time scales 
consequently concurrent voice connections easily multiplexed share common expensive wire link allocating fixed amount link capacity connection 
new call request arrives easy determine link sufficient capacity carry additional load 
result voice networks engineered circuit switching fashion 
routers internal network responsible forwarding traffic link ultimately reaches destination keep track currently active connection new traffic arrives look corresponding connection determine forward traffic 
principal abstraction known providing virtual circuits network behaves provides direct circuit traffic source way destination 
contrast voice traffic data traffic variable individual connections ranging extremely short extremely long extremely low rate extremely high rate 
properties led design data networks individual data packet datagram transmitted network forwarded network independently previous packets may transmitted connection 
packet self contained routers need inspect header packet determine destination forward network 
consequently routers keep track currently active connection 
shift away circuit switching packet switching profound implications 
hand results highly efficient networks 
time capacity available network newly arriving packets benefit 
packet network competes happens little competing traffic particular path connection enjoy entire bandwidth path transfer data quickly 
connections compete path receive unfair portion available bandwidth 
addition packet switching buys enormous robustness enables networks route transparently router link failures perturbing active connections 
routers problem accepting rerouted traffic far tell way new traffic notion current traffic problem accepting traffic moment know existed situation different circuit switched network routers easily accept rerouted traffic knowledge corresponding virtual circuit 
links overloaded packets arrive transmission rates exceeding capacity link 
packets buffered awaiting transmission link excess rate sustained condition termed congestion ultimately buffers routers fill packets discarded dropped 
ensure sources behave properly presence congestion network protocols transmitting data internet include congestion control mechanisms decrease automatically rate data transmitted congestion detected 
important consequence congestion control traffic network shaped conditions connection encountered past 
internet traffic includes basic mechanism introduces significant complicated correlations time complex interactions active connections 
damaging legacy telephony influence data network research virtually complete absence attempts validate crucial modeling assumptions actual data network traffic measurements 
just measurement studies suffice discover data traffic highly variable bursty 
come steady rate starts fits 
term bursty readily understood intuitive meaning turns precise mathematical meaning profound implications developing mathematical models network traffic 
natural approach getting handle burstiness define terms time scale activities occur 
telephony time scale related rate poisson process describes dynamics call arrivals 
example sec time scale burstiness msec periods sustained greater average activity sustained lower average smaller larger time scales occur rapidly vanishing probability 
practitioners long observed traffic bursts data networks occur different time scales multi scale burstiness simply fit world traditional poisson traffic modeling

difference poisson model measured traffic obvious striking time scale increases poisson traffic smooths quite tame measured traffic shows 
difference absolutely crucial engineering perspective traffic behaves shown left column easily engineered 
certain time scale surprises boils knowing long term arrival rate need big buffers routers switches reasons conservative choosing safe operating points engineering backbone trunks think user perceived quality ofservice relevant issue 
stark contrast measured traffic shown right column wild remains quite coarse time scales plays havoc conventional traffic engineering routers require big buffers accommodate traffic fluctuations time scales absence effective controls safe operating points set conservatively traffic saturate link time time scale adequate network performance longer taken guarantee happy individual users
