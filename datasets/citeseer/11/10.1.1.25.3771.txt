communicative action theory scientific framework analysis interaction net ves cat habermas 
theory applied example information systems development communication business activity modelling 
follows principles guidelines provided janson 
cat consists main types social actions available participants 
success oriented instrumental action performed individual aiming advance personal interests 
individual seeks bring wished condition behaving technical rules derived empirical knowledge theoretical models 
strategic action occurs social world involves individuals seek bring desired state affairs 
means individual assessing expected results action takes account action counterpart 
regulated action occurs members social group act accordance common values 
members expect counterparts behave particular way certain situations 
action presentation self public forum 
disseminates understanding individual strengths weaknesses true fake 
communicative action aims bring consensus rational argument 
individuals arrive common description consensus situation process negotiation ordinate action plans aforementioned situation description 
action aims establish set common norms participants 
entails explanation discussion criticism validity norms govern communicative action

proceedings workshop october madeira portugal ieee computer society press instrumental avatar appearance clear example personal achievement 
games longer relationship player avatar encourage player effort developing character symbol personal achievement 
control ordination involves possibility prevent damage running dangerous area jumping pool toxic waste 
object interactions placing wound order bleeding common material balancing games 
example special protective suit possible enter locations impossible reach 
world modifications quite limited action games simpler examples breaking containers collect pulling lever get 
strategic autonomous category includes set actions counter measures anticipate players actions 
examples automatically blocking surprise attack evading stronger opponent critically wounded initiating counter attack player direct command 
avatar appearance decoy cases team colours 
furthermore wearing special equipment possible gain advantage 
control ordination main strategic class competitive games 
attacking team defending flag crawling order avoid exposure enemy examples type 
language communication forms strategic backbone games value communication aspects 
examples action fast paced shooting games 
bluffing opposite team false status reports distracting enemy feeding irritating indicate interaction class 
object interactions strategically utilised example extra energy gain advantage stealing critical artefact take 
world modifications cutting access destroying bridge opening trapdoor located opponent examples achievements actions 
regulated autonomous interactions strongly opposed form actions settings balance game easily disrupted automatic procedures amount autonomic interactions may forced system essential part game rules 
avatar appearance regulate colours shapes avatars inside team 
visible equipment may indicate special role abilities team member red cross pack medic magic wand wizard 
control ordination category includes hiding special place players quite strongly regulated playing communities 
players team oriented games usually targets dislike 
gestures act secret code player group 
example waving hand encountering avatars part protocol developed clan 
strongest evidence regulated language communication debate pursue character language 
role playing want strong suspension disbelief possible want communication follow norms game setting 
physical contacts world modifications usually strictly regulated system occurrences player community regulations 
example building castle close players premises may lead serious 
avatar appearance reflect players style attitude truly falsely 
equipment carried show power player names avatars indicate purposeful act 
world modifications include examples similar actions 
control coordination interaction tactical opponent false attack concentrating strong 
gestures raising hands sign strong part act types interactions supported system 
unfortunately gestures relatively limited multi player games 
language communication calling medic wounded create false illusion player current status 
similar action executed object interaction weaker weapon preserving stronger emergency 
physical contact category especially elimination players purposes fair play purposes surprise attacks 
communicative control ordination aimed find consensus team configuration attack defence synchronisation 
group usually amount communicative action 
negotiations executed language interactions making language main tool action 
consensus seeking settings object interaction category includes interactions sharing treasure equally group exchanging artefacts utilising win win principle

proceedings workshop october madeira portugal ieee computer society press game settings easily unbalanced 
decision limit types actions may successful player basis 
resulted specific gaming servers disable certain features gaming worlds consist separate zones individual norms 
action may executed control ordination category example configuration teams balanced 
weaker team may original configurations current situation 
cat criticised light conditions communicative action takes place 
idealistic environment freely speaking highly contributing collectively acting individuals may hard find real world 
hand game settings communities may enable totally different conditions cases

second limitation cat language centred perspective

research illustrated describes concept interaction order lay basic ground research 
understanding interaction occurring inside networked virtual environments provided analysing communicative social aspects computer mediated interaction multi player games 
main categories proposed interaction taxonomy analysed light communicative action theory 
analysis indicates strong social aspect current networked multi player games 
games contain limited amount communication interactions follow types social actions 
furthermore findings suggest proposed interaction taxonomy reflect types actions occurring multi player games 
amount overlapping confusion indicate taxonomy constructed social action types categorisation selected author
