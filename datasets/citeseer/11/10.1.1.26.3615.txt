feature explains prevalence practice models presume market completeness 
unfortunately conditions required models produce market completeness generally quite stringent 
example models black scholes merton heath jarrow morton state space reduced significantly requiring continuous price processes asset space inflated substantially allowing continuous trading 
unfortunately empirical suggest realistic price processes trading opportunities typically permit market completeness
