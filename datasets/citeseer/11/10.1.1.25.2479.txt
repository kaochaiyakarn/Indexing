factors contributed problem semantic heterogeneity terminology conflicts overriding factors need organizations assert ownership data 
organizations wish data wish assume responsibility curation data wish share data defined sharing agreements 
spend large amounts money centralized data warehouse enterprises implementing smaller data integrating federated architectures 
federated data warehouses trend away centralized data warehouse leads notion federated data warehouse independent smaller warehouses publish selected data data integrated 
interesting case study insurance decided build federated data warehouse combining data central meta data repository existing stand line business lob warehouses 
approach turned easier time resource consuming 
federated warehouse marketing personnel determine customers life property insurance order sell securities 
data resided distinct lob data warehouses implemented differing commercial products query languages 
queries common business decision making inability answer questions leads lost revenues 
approach involves creation information hub containing data interest entire data interest remains local data warehouses 
hub create specialized data decision makers 
federated approach appealing common data reside metadata repository rapidly changing data reside data underlying data sources
