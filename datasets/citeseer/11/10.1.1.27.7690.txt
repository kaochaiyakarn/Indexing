chapter motivation information retrieval ir deals representation storage organization access information items 
representation organization information items provide user easy access information interested 
unfortunately characterization user information need simple problem 
consider instance hypothetical user information need context world wide web just web find pages documents containing information college tennis teams maintained university usa participate tennis tournament 
relevant page include information national ranking team years email phone number team coach 
clearly full description user information need directly request information current interfaces web search engines 
user translate information need query processed search engine ir system 
common form translation yields set keywords index terms summarizes description user information need 
user query key goal ir system retrieve information useful relevant user 
emphasis retrieval information opposed retrieval data 
information versus data retrieval data retrieval context ir system consists mainly determining documents collection contain keywords user query frequently satisfy user information need 
fact user ir system concerned retrieving information subject retrieving data satisfies query 
data retrieval language aims retrieving objects satisfy clearly defined conditions regular expression relational algebra expression 
data retrieval system single erroneous object retrieved objects means total failure 
information retrieval system retrieved objects inaccurate small errors go unnoticed 
main reason difference information retrieval usually deals natural language text structured semantically ambiguous 
hand data retrieval system relational database deals data defined structure semantics 
data retrieval providing solution user database system solve problem retrieving information subject topic 
effective attempt satisfy user information need ir system interpret contents information items documents collection rank degree relevance user query 
interpretation document content involves extracting syntactic semantic information document text information match user information need 
difficulty knowing extract information knowing decide relevance 
notion relevance center information retrieval 
fact primary goal ir system retrieve documents relevant user query retrieving non relevant documents possible 
information retrieval center stage past years area information retrieval grown primary goals indexing text searching useful documents collection 
nowadays research ir includes modeling document classification categorization systems architecture user interfaces data visualization filtering languages despite maturity ir seen narrow area interest mainly librarians information experts 
vision prevailed years despite rapid dissemination users modern personal computers ir tools multimedia hypertext applications 
single fact changed perceptions world wide web 
web universal repository human knowledge culture allowed sharing ideas information scale seen 
success conception standard user interface matter computational environment run interface 
result user shielded details communication protocols machine location operating systems 
user create web documents point web documents restrictions 
key aspect turns web new publishing medium accessible everybody 
immediate basic concepts consequence web user push personal agenda little effort cost 
universe frontiers attracted tremendous attention millions people 
furthermore causing revolution way people computers perform daily tasks 
instance home shopping home banking popular generated dollars revenues 
despite success web introduced new problems 
finding useful information web frequently tedious difficult task 
instance satisfy information need user navigate space web links hyperspace searching information interest 
hyperspace vast unknown navigation task usually inefficient 
naive users problem harder entirely frustrate efforts 
main obstacle absence defined underlying data model web implies information definition structure frequently low quality 
difficulties attracted renewed interest ir techniques promising solutions 
result overnight ir gained place technologies center stage 
focus book despite great increase interest information retrieval modern textbooks ir broad extensive coverage various topics field difficult find 
attempt partially fulfill gap book presents view research ir computer scientist perspective 
means focus book computer algorithms techniques information retrieval systems 
distinct viewpoint taken librarians information science researchers adopt interpretation ir problem 
interpretation focus trying understand people interpret information opposed structure store retrieve information automatically 
book dedicated computer scientist viewpoint ir problem human centered viewpoint discussed extent chapters 
put great emphasis integration different areas closed related information retrieval problem treated 
reason covering text retrieval library systems user interfaces web book discusses visualization multimedia retrieval digital libraries 
basic concepts effective retrieval relevant information directly affected user task logical view documents adopted retrieval system discuss 
retrieval browsing database interaction user retrieval system distinct tasks 
user task user retrieval system translate information need query language provided system 
information retrieval system normally implies specifying set words convey semantics information need 
data retrieval system query expression instance regular expression convey constraints satisfied objects answer set 
cases say user searches useful information executing retrieval task 
consider user interest poorly defined inherently broad 
instance user interested documents car racing general 
situation user interactive interface simply look collection documents related car racing 
instance find interesting documents formula racing car manufacturers hours le mans 
furthermore reading hours le mans turn attention document provides directions le mans documents cover tourism france 
situation say user browsing documents collection searching 
process retrieving information main objectives clearly defined purpose change interaction system 
book clear distinction different tasks user retrieval system engaged 
task distinct types information data retrieval browsing 
classic information retrieval systems normally allow information data retrieval 
hypertext systems usually tuned providing quick browsing 
modern digital library web interfaces attempt combine tasks provide improved retrieval capabilities 
combination retrieval browsing basic concepts established approach dominant paradigm 
illustrates interaction user different tasks identify 
information data retrieval usually provided modern information retrieval systems web interfaces 
systems provide limited form browsing 
combining information data retrieval browsing common practice 
retrieval browsing language world wide web pulling actions 
user requests information interactive manner 
alternative retrieval automatic permanent fashion software agents push information user 
instance information useful user extracted periodically news service 
case say ir system executing particular retrieval task consists filtering relevant information inspection user 
briefly discuss filtering chapter 
logical view documents due historical reasons documents collection frequently represented set index terms keywords 
keywords extracted directly text document specified human subject frequently done information sciences arena 
matter representative keywords derived automatically generated specialist provide logical view document 
precise definition concept document characteristics see chapter 
modern computers making possible represent document full set words 
case say retrieval system adopts full text logical view representation documents 
large collections modern computers reduce set representative keywords 
accomplished elimination stopwords articles connectives stemming reduces distinct words common grammatical root identification noun groups eliminates adjectives adverbs verbs 
compression employed 
operations called text operations transformations covered detail chapter 
text operations reduce complexity document representation allow moving logical view full text set index terms 
full text clearly complete logical view document usage usually implies higher computational costs 
small set categories generated human specialist provides concise logical view document usage lead retrieval poor quality 
intermediate logical views document adopted information retrieval system illustrated 
adopting intermediate representations retrieval system recognize internal structure normally document chapters sections subsections 
text structure text structure accents spacing stopwords recognition groups stemming automatic manual indexing noun document full text structure index terms logical view document full text set index terms 
information structure document quite useful required structured text retrieval models discussed chapter 
illustrated view issue logically representing document continuum logical view document shift smoothly full text representation higher level representation specified human subject 
past early developments approximately years man organized information retrieval usage 
typical example table contents book 
volume information eventually grew books necessary build specialized data structures ensure faster access stored information 
old popular data structure faster information retrieval collection selected words concepts associated pointers related information documents index 
form indexes core modern information retrieval system 
provide faster access data allow query processing task speeded 
detailed coverage indexes usage searching chapter 
centuries indexes created manually categorization hierarchies 
fact libraries form categorical hierarchy classify volumes documents discussed chapter 
hierarchies usually conceived human subjects library sciences field 
advent modern computers possible construction large indexes automatically 
automatic indexes provide view retrieval problem related system user need 
past respect important distinguish different views ir problem computer centered human centered 
computer centered view ir problem consists mainly building efficient indexes processing user queries high performance developing ranking algorithms improve quality answer set 
human centered view ir problem consists mainly studying behavior user understanding main needs determining understanding affects organization operation retrieval system 
view keyword query processing seen strategy yield solution information retrieval problem long run 
book focus mainly computer centered view ir problem continues dominant market place 
information retrieval library libraries institutions adopt ir systems retrieving information
