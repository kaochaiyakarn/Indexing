want differential operator create diffusion process tank 
simplest operator desired characteristics laplacian consider operator 
start euclidean space 
problem formulated way 
general don need compute exactly distance source 
invertible function distance convey information 
consider functions form constant 
want know properties function function harmonic 
gi xi gii want avoid necessity parentheses 
reason coordinates perceptual space contravariant quantities section take liberty notation subscript notation xi 
laplacian introduce variable allows express laplacian define function condition harmonic translates rewritten 
solution equation zy dy dz dy dz log log cz cz function looking cu du zk log definition second condition function harmonic log value irrelevant due presence log incorporated constant function harmonic comes fact 
solution gives function distance compute laplace operator 
solution differential equation dirac distribution gives distance precisely function distance point 
nonlinear spaces know map structure compute function distance euclidean space

remember fairly general riemann space deal simple euclidean space 
easily translate previous considerations general case covariant formalism 
note form far laplace operator xi going back deal general riemann spaces distinction covariant contravariant indices quite important 
reason idea section stand extra parentheses equations go back proper indices 
coordinates indicated proper way ii invariant transformations coordinate system 
depends fact regular derivatives covariant derivatives 
assume perceptual space locally riemann space vanishing curvature true spaces far 
find coordinate system gij ij 
known normal coordinate system 
system considerations done previous section continue hold 
write laplacian operator covariant form gv ik important property form scalar invariant respect transformations coordinate system 
means don need normal coordinates solutions previous section continue hold long covariant form laplacian operator
