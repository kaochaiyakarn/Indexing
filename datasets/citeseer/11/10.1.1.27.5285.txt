kinds architectures view agent consisting main components russell norvig agent program implements mapping percepts actions called action selection function action composition

main concern agent architecture 
architecture defines atomic operations agent program implicitly defines components agent 
example load store operations conventional cpu imply sort memory operations effect supposed calling load store return saved value 
architecture determines operations happen automatically agent program having incrementing program counter conventional cpu production firing conflict resolution rule system

likewise agent programs architecture implement new higher level architecture virtual machine
