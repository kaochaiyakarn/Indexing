hand selecting discriminating terms order represent contents texts critical problem 
ideally indexing terms directly describe concepts documents

unfortunately domains contain pre defined thesauri projects include automatic construction specialised thesauri grefenstette 
order overcome lack domain specific thesauri evolutionary retrieval systems multiword terms previously extracted text collections represent contents texts evans 
multiword terms embody meaningful sequences words ambiguous single words allow approximating accurately contents texts 
hand information retrieval system able guide user search information allowing refine query list relevant terms semantically match initial search 
user able visit document space concept keeping trace route 
discriminating power multiword terms plays fundamental role operation proposing refined view contents text collection 
multiword terms listed lexical databases
