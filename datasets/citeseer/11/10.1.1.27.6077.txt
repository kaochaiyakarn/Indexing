development conversational interfaces offers set significant challenges speech natural language researchers raises important research issues discussed remainder section 

spoken language understanding spoken language understanding involves transformation speech signal meaning representation interact specific application back 
typically accomplished steps conversion signal set words speech recognition derivation meaning word hypotheses language understanding 

speech recognition historically speech recognition systems long developed assumption speech material read prepared text 
input conversational interfaces typically generated containing disfluencies unfilled filled pauses word fragments words outside system working vocabulary 
far attempts deal problems 
example researchers improved system recognition performance introducing explicit acoustic models filled pauses 
similarly trash models introduced detect presence unknown words procedures devised learn new words detected 
issue receiving increasing attention research community recognition telephone quality speech 
highly conversational interfaces available general public accessible telephone cases replacing presently existing ivr systems 
telephone quality speech significantly difficult recognize high quality recordings limited bandwidth noise distortions introduced channel 

language understanding speech recognition systems typically implement linguistic constraints statistical grammar ngram specifies probability word predecessors 
language models effective reducing search space improving performance address issue speech understanding 
hand natural language systems developed text input mind usually assumed entire word string known certainty 
assumption clearly false speech input words competing time span youth asia words may reliable varying signal robustness 
furthermore spoken language containing fragments disfluencies partial words 
language understanding systems designed text input may modified fundamental ways accommodate spoken input 
natural language analysis traditionally predominantly syntax driven complete syntactic analysis performed attempts account words utterance 
working spoken material researchers quickly came realize approach break dramatically presence unknown words novel linguistic constructs recognition errors spontaneous speech events false starts 
due problems researchers tended favor semantic driven approaches spoken language tasks limited domains 
approaches meaning representation derived spotting key words phrases utterance 
approach loses constraint provided syntax may able adequately interpret complex linguistic constructs need accommodate spontaneous speech input outweighed potential shortcomings 
time viable systems abandoned notion achieving complete syntactic analysis input sentence favoring robust strategy answer full parse achieved 
accomplished identifying parsable phrases clauses providing separate mechanism gluing form complete meaning analysis 
ideally parser includes probabilistic framework smooth transition parsing fragments full linguistic analysis achievable 
examples systems incorporate stochastic modelling techniques 

sr nl integration speech recognition component interact natural language component order obtain correct meaning representation 
popular strategy called best interface recognizer proposes best complete sentence hypotheses stopping sentence successfully analyzed natural language component 
case natural language component acts filter sentence hypotheses 
best interface candidate sentences may differ minimally regions acoustic information robust 
confusions acoustically reasonable eliminated linguistic grounds 
fact top sentence hypotheses eliminated reaching syntactic semantic analyses taken place early search 
possible solution speech recognition natural language components tightly coupled acoustically promising hypotheses linguistically meaningful advanced 
example partial theories arranged stack prioritized score 
promising partial theories extended natural language component predictor possible word candidates word hypotheses allowed proceed 
theory completes guaranteed parse 
researchers find tightly coupled integration strategy achieve higher performance best interface considerably smaller stack size 
see increasing instances systems making linguistic analysis early stages recognition process 

spoken language generation output side conversational interface able convey information user natural sounding sentences 
typically accomplished steps information converted formed sentences fed speech tts system generate verbal responses 
spoken language generation serves important roles provides verbal response user queries provide paraphrase user input serve confirmation system proper understanding input query 
research language generation conversational systems received nearly attention language understanding due funding priorities set forth major government sponsors 
language generation component conversational system typically produces response sentence time paragraph level planning 
effective approach sentence generation concatenate templates filling slots applying recursive rules appropriate constraints person gender number 
currently language generation text components output side conversational systems closely coupled text generated read spoken 
furthermore current systems typically expect language generation component produce textual surface form sentence throwing away valuable linguistic prosodic knowledge require text speech component produce linguistic analysis anew 
clearly components benefit shared knowledge base 

discourse dialogue human verbal communication way process involving multiple active participants 
mutual understanding achieved direct indirect speech acts turn clarification pragmatic considerations 
effective conversational interface information retrieval interactive transactions incorporate extensive complex dialogue modelling initiating appropriate clarification sub dialogues partial understanding active role directing conversation valid 
theoretical structure human human dialogue led effective insights building human machine interactive systems 
essential system able interpret user queries context 
instance user says want go boston denver followed show united flights clearly don want see united flights just ones fly boston denver 
ability inherit information preceding sentences particularly helpful face recognition errors 
user may asked complex question involving restrictions recognizer may misunderstood single word flight number arrival time 
context model exists user utter short correction phrase system able replace just misunderstood word preventing user having entire sentence running risk recognition errors

system efficiently ported different task domain changing geographical area city entirely different domain library information access 
research issues surface confronted need human language technology truly useful solving real problems 
consider example unknown word problem 
traditional approach spoken language recognition understanding research development define working vocabulary domain specific corpora 
experience shown matter large size training corpora system invariably encounter previously unseen words 
illustrated 
atis task example word training corpus yield vocabulary words 
probability system encountering unknown word 
assuming average sentence contains words mean approximately sentences contain unknown word 
real domain jupiter electronic yellow pages larger fraction words uttered users system working vocabulary 
unavoidable partly possible anticipate words users partly database usually changing time new restaurants opening 
past paid attention unknown word problem tasks chosen assume closed vocabulary 
limited cases vocabulary open unknown words accounted small fraction word tokens test corpus 
researchers construct generic trash word models hope best ignore unknown word problem altogether accept small penalty word error rate 
real applications system able cope unknown words number unique words new words voyager atis nyt atis voyager number training words voyager nyt voyager atis atis number training words wsj wsj number unique words task vocabulary function size training corpora spoken language tasks percentage unknown words previously unseen data function size training corpora determine vocabulary empirically
