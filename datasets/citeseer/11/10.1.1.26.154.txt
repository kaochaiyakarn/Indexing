special attention paid protect privacy system users 
world wide web web browsers available today provide users bookmarking facility 
bookmark system provide users ability save addresses web pages sites users judge relevant information need 
typically bookmark record holds information url indexed page page title data bookmark creation date visit date user provided description indexed page 
bookmark set personal web space help user land marking huge information space composed currently available web pages 
major reason popularity bookmarks ease 
browsers simple click save currently visited web page list bookmarks 
simple click saved bookmark takes user directly required site 
addition bookmarks reduce cognitive physical load managing url addresses release user typing interpreting unfriendly urls 
user bookmark set effective user customized gate internet problems need handled 
resource discovery problem 
bookmark recall problem 
bookmarks maintenance problem 
discuss briefly cited problems 
resource discovery problem effective personal web space provide user sites match best information needs 
mainly propose user new sites interest 
burden feeding bookmark list exclusively charge user 
fact reported empirical study abrams bookmarks mainly created archival purposes 
say bookmarks save addresses visited sites 
established relevant resource discovery main problem face web users 
effective web resource discovery tools hot topic 
systems propose automatic approach building feeding bookmark sets 
recall problem useful bookmark easily needed 
number bookmarks small say bookmarks finding relevant easy 
number bookmarks relatively big organizational scheme applied order enhance recall time 
existing bookmark management systems enable users organize bookmarks hierarchy folders 
hierarchical structures may effectively enhance retrieval time introduce new problems users continually tradeoff cost organizing bookmarks remembering bookmarks folder versus cost having deal disorganized set bookmarks abrams 
providing automated bookmark organization capabilities enhance global usage bookmark systems maarek 
empirical study reported abrams users file bookmarks creation time users organized bookmarks half users organize bookmarks sporadic way 
percentages need confirmed large scale express real tendency web users 
tow reasons may explain percentages 
finding appropriate folder bookmark easy task 
bookmark may fit folder 
bookmark mar require create new folder split existing folders maarek 
filing bookmark folder easily supported current browsers creation bookmark 
frequently requires open specific application tool dedicated bookmark organization introducing gaps process web navigation 
maintenance problem web sites users information needs evolve time 
consequently bookmark sets need revised continually order 
match evolution user information need 
ensure stored bookmarks valid avoid broken links obsolete contents 
maintenance time consuming process 
way people maintain continually set bookmarks abrams 
result noisy bookmarks user bookmark list 
high level entropy bookmark organization recall processes expensive reducing utility bookmark set 
collaborative bookmark systems motivations main approaches explored scientific literature face cited problems 
personal assistants approach 
idea provide personal software agents learn automatically semi automatically user profile user interests behavior able learned profile help users automating realization cited tasks 
example system uses bookmark hierarchy web user creates recommend new web sites 
maarek ben shaul authors propose agent help user organizing re organizing hierarchy bookmarks 

collaborative approach 
basic idea enable group users share experiences managing bookmarks 
sharing bookmarks provide solutions problems discussed 
obvious sharing bookmarks user benefit urls interesting users 
urls expected better quality urls returned searching engine implicitly explicitly evaluated users 
applying collaborative filtering technique resnick quality new discovered urls improved 
manner having access hierarchy defined user get hints better organize bookmark hierarchy 
manner maintenance efforts user reused users direct indirect way resulting lower maintenance cost 
recommender systems vocabulary approach corresponds content recommendation second corresponds collaborative filtering resnick 
approaches jointly system demonstrated fab system balabanovic 
personal agent bookmark management enhance effectiveness cooperating personal agents 
focus design implementation issues collaborative bookmark management system 
reminder organized follows 
report main observations bookmark usage pattern 
section analysis requirement set met shared bookmark system 
section proposes functional classification shared bookmark systems discuss main architectural issues systems 
section discuss existing shared bookmark systems 
existing systems analyzed evaluated function satisfaction set requirements identified earlier 
bookmarks patterns studying design issues collaborative bookmark management system important idea actual single user bookmark systems 
interesting study bookmarks usage pattern reported abrams abrams 
maarek proposes requirement study single user bookmark systems 
studies structure current study function sequence phases compose life cycle bookmark create bookmark bookmarks organized deleted 
bookmarks created 
main reasons motivate users bookmark web site 
obvious reason usefulness site 
book marking page viewed implicit positive rating content page wittenburg 
motivation book marking pages 
motivations abrams high visit frequency bookmarked page potential interest page 
users consult frequently web site tend bookmark site order access process 
important notice accessing frequently web site mean necessarily content site part user interests centers 
example users bookmark internet search engine site ex 
altavista yahoo metacrawler 
sites fixed content 
case news sites cnn newspapers sites 
bookmarks 
surprising study reported abrams subsequent part created bookmarks users 
authors median time months visit bookmark 
authors point view observation strength archival nature created bookmarks 
types bookmark usage pattern cache collaborative 
mode user share stored bookmark people sending mails incorporating bookmark specific published web page 
mode bookmark speed access sites frequently consulted user 
bookmarks organized 
question bookmark organization discussed section recall problem 
need tools assist users bookmark organization crucial issue success bookmark systems customized web spaces abrams maarek 
bookmarks deleted 
deciding delete existing bookmark time consuming task requires user re visit bookmarked site evaluate relevancy site current information need 
required cost users take time delete useful bookmarks 
best cases useful bookmarks deleted sporadic reorganization sessions abrams 
discussion analysis bookmark usage pattern shows consequent part saved bookmarks correspond current user interests 
consequently obsolete bookmarks feed construction current user profile 
consequently systems take indexed web sites part user interest centers making non negligible error 
information effective utilization bookmark frequency consultation filing nature filing context taken consideration composing user profile bookmark set 
question construct user profile basing user behavior managing bookmarks discussed coming publication requirements shared bookmark systems section study main requirements ideal collaborative bookmark system meet 
current requirement study guided usability concept 
issues influence usability shared bookmark system common groupware applications critical mass problem markus privacy protection issues 
specific application field cold start personalization problems 
review main issues believe influence usability shared bookmark systems cite requirements system meet 
critical mass problem widely admitted success collaborative application depends constitution critical mass users markus point benefits application outweigh costs user pay system 
benefits groupware designer groupware system minimize maximum additional effort users order system 
rule minimize cost user adoption collaborative application users able continue usual software collaboration settings kanawati 
result system support heterogeneity applications execution platforms 
context expressed requirement 
users able collaborate usual single user bookmark management systems 
factor influence adoption collaborative system performances system 
field interactive application main issues prime importance system availability system responsiveness 
single user settings creation bookmark visualization folder content short 
users collaborative system imply longer response times low availability 
creation take seconds users create bookmarks single user settings consult frequently bookmark set takes long time view bookmark set content 

system performances terms availability responsiveness comparable single user bookmark management systems cold start problem major advantage sharing bookmarks ability share users opinions bookmarks 
fact user submit explicitly implicitly bookmark group users submission process interpreted recommendation 
applying collaborative filtering technique selection relevant bookmarks enhanced 
serious problem face collaborative filtering cold start problem resnick 
collaborative filtering requires concerned users number ratings order able discover similarities people 
real world settings people prefer play role recommendation consumers recommendation producers 
example analyzing user contribution different public communities interests supported experimental site pharos system pharos inria fr contributions total number community members 
behavior lead inevitably system failure 
active people get real benefits system may lead contribution 
useable shared bookmark system satisfy requirement 
system useful users early possible personalization personalization difficult problem face collaborative shared bookmark management systems 
problem folds 
user able tailor application function view points information needs 

secondly system provide users relevant recommendations match view points information needs 
area shared bookmark systems focus second issue 
handle issue system users 
illustrate importance issue example hierarchical organization bookmarks 
user point view preferences organize bookmarks 
imposing hierarchy users just allowing stranger organize desktop maarek 
people accept relinquish control bookmarks 
systems impose users case knowledge pump glance pharos users obliged maintain different systems personal group oriented 
clear separation cooperative tools individual tools task factor leads collaborative applications failure kanawati navarro 
consequently shared bookmark system meet requirements 
system tailorable users 

system provide users customized recommendations privacy protection classical problem collaborative system design privacy protection 
users able control know simply refuse system 
existing systems provide binary protection scheme allow users define information private public 
real world settings relations people expressed binary way 
user may wish share part knowledge user part user fine grained access control schemes provided kanawati 

system provide users fine grained access control module 
user able control share

architectural issues classical way distinguish tow basic types architectures centralized architecture distributed 
centralized architecture central server keep shared date bookmarks information system users user profiles 
main advantage architecture simplicity 
existing shared bookmark management system centralized architecture see section 
architecture type suffers number serious drawbacks 
centralized architectures subject single point failure problems 
central server fails unreachable network failure system compromised 
centralized architecture may provide poor system availability 
system responsiveness compromised user actions treated remote machine 
addition centralized architecture known scaling problems 
importantly centralization presents trust problem foner 
requirement see section states users control share data 
centralizing data remote server user loose control data 
believe distributed architecture implement useable shared bookmark system 
architecture user keeps locally data view data 
problems availability responsiveness scaling resolved 
users control share bookmarks 
solution drawbacks 
implementing distributed architecture requires designer solve difficult problem coordination different sites
