dave clark van jacobson differentiated services munich ietf meeting 
explained bit ip header deliver new kind service packets internet 
different kinds service quite different policy assumptions 
ensuing discussion convinced service types merit service types implemented set similar mechanisms 
propose architectural framework permits service types exploits similarities forwarding path mechanisms 
major goals architecture shared proposals keep forwarding path simple push complexity edges network extent possible provide service avoids assumptions type traffic employ allocation policy compatible long term short term provisioning possible dominant internet traffic model remain best effort 
major contributions document distinct service types set general mechanisms forwarding path implement range differentiated services propose flexible framework provisioning differentiated services network 
precisely kind architecture needed expedient deployment differentiated services need framework set primitives implemented short term provide interoperable services provide sandbox experimentation elaboration lead time levels differentiation service needed 
risk analogy motivated provide services tiers somewhat fashion airlines class business class coach class

clark wroclawski defined assured service follows expected capacity usage profiles statistically provisioned 
assurance user service receives traffic dropped long stays expected capacity profile 
exact meaning depends 
underlying similarity accident dave clark parts architecture early jacobson heavily influenced simplicity scalability clark model 
page provisioned service assured service traffic flow may exceed profile excess traffic assurance level 
jacobson defined premium service provisioned peak capacity profiles strictly high priority queue routers 
premium service traffic flow shaped hard limited provisioned peak rate shaped bursts injected network 
premium service presents virtual wire flow bursts may queue shaper edge network proportion indegree router 
despite similarities approaches result fundamentally different services 
uses buffer management provide better effort service creates service little jitter queueing delay need queue management premium packets queue 
assured service introduced clark wroclawski alterations specification architecture 
refinements expected capacity framework clark fang 
framework focused providing different levels best effort service times network congestion mentions possible separate router queue implement guaranteed level assurance

premium service documented describe follow description bit architecture 
premium service premium service fundamentally different internet current best effort service 
service meant replace best effort primarily meet emerging demand commercial service share network best effort traffic 
desirable economically network kinds traffic 
expected premium traffic allocated small percentage total network capacity priced higher 
service create virtual leased lines saving cost building maintaining separate network 
premium service standard telephone line capacity customer expects receiver lifted may depending household idle deal time 
provisioning premium traffic way reduces capacity best effort internet amount premium allocated worst case priced accordingly 
hand capacity available best effort traffic 
contrast normal best effort traffic bursty requires queue management deal fairly congestive episodes premium service design creates regular traffic patterns small nonexistent queues 
premium service levels specified desired peak bit rate specific flow aggregation flows 
user contract network exceed peak rate 
network contract contracted bandwidth available traffic sent 
hop routers edge devices filter packets entering network set premium bit match premium service specification perform traffic shaping flow smooths traffic bursts enter network 
approach requires changes hosts 
compliant router path needs levels priority queueing sending packets premium bit set 
best effort traffic unmarked queued sent lower priority 
results virtual networks identical today internet buffers designed absorb traffic bursts traffic limited shaped contracted peak rate packets move network queues experience queueing delay 
architecture forwarding path decisions separately simply setting service agreements traffic profiles 
exception policing shaping administrative trust boundaries actions need handled forwarding path classify packet queues single bit service queues simple priority 
shaping include rate burst parameters expected small packet range 
policing boundaries enforces rate compliance may implemented simple token bucket 
admission set procedures expected evolve time dynamically configurable fairly complex mechanisms forwarding path remain simple 
premium service built architecture deployed useful way forwarding path mechanisms place making static allocations 
traffic flows designated special treatment network management configuration 
traffic flows designated source destination combination fields packet header

adherence subscribed rate burst size enforced entry network system hop router 
intranet administrative domain trust region packets classified serviced solely premium bit 
packets cross boundary policing function critical 
entered region check prioritized packet flow conformance rate regions agreed discarding packets exceed rate best interests region ensure conformance agreed rate egress 
requirement means premium traffic burst free rule leads directly observation premium queues easily sized prevent need drop packets need queue management policy 
router largest queue size related degree routers quite small order packets 
premium bandwidth allocations represent commitment network priced accordingly 
note architecture premium traffic experience considerably delay variation best effort traffic assured data traffic 
premium rates configured subscription basis near term demand dynamic set signaling available 
shows premium packet flow established particular administrative domain sent access link isp 
assume host hop router configured match flow host ip address destination ip address reached isp 
premium flow configured host rate smaller total premium allocation isp bytes second smaller amount allocation assigned hosts packets marked special way leave host 
hop router clears premium bit arriving packets sets premium bit packets designated flow shapes packets premium flow configured rate burst size queues best effort unmarked packets low priority queue shaped premium packets high priority queue sends packets queues simple priority 
intermediate routers internal enqueue packets output queues premium bit service queues simple priority 
border routers perform quite different tasks depending processing egress flow ingress flow 
egress border router may perform reshaping aggregate premium traffic conform rate depending number premium flows aggregated 
ingress border routers need perform simple policing function implemented token bucket 
example isp accepts premium packets long flow exceed bytes second 

alternative strategy downgrade priority non compliant packets 
effect premium flows stay profile causing order packet delivery leads performance ambiguity strategy compatible service
