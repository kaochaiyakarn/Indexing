world wide web www offers promise unlimited access electronic information 
unfortunately reality electronic access unlimited anarchy 
information available www hundreds thousands millions sites placed archives information online 
information known savvy users serendipity 
bring order chaos spiders created surf web collect web pages central location indexing 
web pages distributed result handful computers processed queries millions users day 
searching web went highly distributed activity completely centralized 
web sites providing ability search local collection web pages 
query brokering systems ability sending queries selected local web sites processing 
viable alternative centralized search engines issues resolved particularly scalability identify relevant sites fuse information multiple sites 
project focus automatic creation conceptual meta information local sites specifically weighted ontologies regional information agents 
browsing method find information 
search engines provide subject hierarchies browsed associated web pages manually placed categories limits amount information available 
contrast build browsing structure automatically producing weighted ontologies categorizing documents local site 
addition just shared meta information allows user search multiple sites simultaneously query broker shared meta information allow users browse multiple sites simultaneously 
exploring visualization meta information individual multiple sites mechanism provide users overview information space 
meta information created local sites foundation rest project rests 
providing overview project related focus experiments run assess accuracy automatically generated meta information 
conclude initial versions searching browsing visualization agents

section briefly overview techniques site mapping text categorization distributed search agent communication 
site mapping information services categorized types search browsing 
browsing information services provide users overview site help locate web pages interest navigation 
browsing information services require tool creates site map method display site map 
site map generation site map represents information space site relating group web pages particular subject depicting links specified web pages 
generate subject site map describe subject space typically hierarchical structure associate documents appropriate subjects 
manual approaches example infoseek concentrate providing user tools help create topics assign documents appropriate categories rules 
approach analyze contents web pages site produce set statistical data indices train neural network 
outcome neural network representation site map contains labeled subject areas displayed urls related documents 
approach site map generation commercial product clusters documents collected site identifies cluster topics topic relationships contents documents 
link site map usually generated spider starts set initial urls collect web pages site 
site map produced way example represents organization set urls interconnections 
site map display site map display techniques attempt users clear global view site generally allowing quickly navigate areas interest site 
simple spatial arrangement subject titles may group related information 
sophisticated graphical techniques shape color dimensional views may 
common examples fisheye views cone trees treemaps value bars :10.1.1.51.8012
developing simple text displays browsing tasks threedimensional techniques visualization tasks 
text categorization site map generation technique uses text categorization review nave bayes effective classifiers 
approach pre defined categories described terms fixed collection attributes 
descriptions categories obtained inductive generalization process identifies patterns attributes set training data construct classifiers represented decision trees sets production rules 
category corresponds logical expression specifies values attributes 
new documents come extracts values attributes classifies particular categories established decision tree rules 
nave bayes approach conditional probability attribute value particular category determined probability category appearing :10.1.1.135.7718
probabilistic information typically established learning procedure takes new training instance time adjusts probabilistic information corresponding category 
new test instance evaluates ranks candidate categories classifies instance top ranked category probabilistic information categories 
approach assumes attributes probabilistically independent 
distributed search internet witnessing proliferation search engines developed help users find information web 
search engine indexes subset web 
address meta search engines developed select set promising search engines query submit request simultaneously selected search engines fuse results users 
distributed search systems similar meta search engines may send queries document collections centralized search engines 
distributed search divided steps choose best sites particular query query selected sites merge search results sites 
query routing task query routing locate best sites query distributed search environment 
query routing algorithms usually rely meta information describes contents capabilities site 
different query routers require different types meta information 
content summaries contain list words appear collection frequency word collection total number documents contain particular word metainformation 
gram centroids metainformation 
query router matches gram profile query gram centroids sites routes query sites best match 
term similarity matrices meta information query routing effective content summaries 
document collection term term similarities calculated corpus analysis techniques 
query router uses similarity matrices choose collections contain richest set terms similar query 
information fusion distributed search environment rankings results rely individual collections relevance query 
best documents site little information relevant query comparable best documents different collection contains relevant information 
retrieval effectiveness severely degraded responses different collections simply ordered rankings reported individual sites 
approach information fusion attempts maximize total number relevant documents retrieved requesting documents collections believed contain relevant information 
approach rankings reassigned factors value query document match reported site match factor estimated accuracy site confidence factor 
agent communication agent information systems typically require group agents working fulfil common goal 
number different agent architectures allow agents coordinate cooperate 
direct communication approach agents talk directly contract nets specification sharing federated system agents organized hierarchy 
federated agents communicate facilitator coordinates activity agents federation 
major approaches agent communication languages protocols 
declarative approaches kqml corba omg commonly implement platform independent information agents procedural approaches java tcl safe tcl smalltalk perl python telescript activex usually mobile agents 

generating site maps local characterizing agent lca creates site map consists hierarchy subjects associated weights weights indicate amount information relevant subject local site

loa decides subject removed added local ontology data provided lca gives information web pages relevant subject site 
lba lva create representation global view local site site map generated lca 
lsa searches local site index produced lca 
site map produces meta information regional agents see section 
approach lca pre existing ontology case browsing hierarchy prominent web site categorizes web page local site best matching concept

histogram distances assigned concept correct concept number training pages vector space approach nave bayes approach 
addition varying number training pages investigated effect subset words complete test documents input vector space classifier 
words weighted tf idf tf frequency term test document idf inverse document frequency calculated available training documents 
shows results varied number words selected 
data show mean distance decreased number selected words increased little improvement seen words selected

mean distance function number top words test documents 
summary data experiments show vector space approach accurate nave bayes approach modest number training documents approximately concept sufficient performance 
results show small number important words document convey information classification
