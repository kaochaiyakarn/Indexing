image retrieval content versus context university twente department computer science group po box ae enschede netherlands cs utwente nl introduce new approach image retrieval 
new approach takes best worlds combines image features content words collateral text context semantic space 
approach uses latent semantic indexing method uses occurrence statistics uncover hidden semantics 
shows method proven successful monolingual cross lingual text retrieval multi modal cross modal information retrieval

information retrieval years retrieval text images manually created indexes stored back book indexes card indexes

decades techniques developed automatically index large volumes text techniques index images basis associated text context image retrieval

section describes different approaches image retrieval 
subsections basic methods problems respectively context image retrieval content image retrieval discussed 
context image retrieval lot information content image come sources image 
information doesn come visual properties image seen context image 
example place image person pointed tell lot information displayed image 
term context textual information comes image 
context image retrieval annotations manually added disclosing images keywords descriptions collateral text accidentally available image captions subtitles nearby text 
texts indexes created standard text retrieval techniques 
similarity images similarity associated texts turn similarity word 
important problem approach difference word documents 
documents discuss subject different words synonymy words describing different concepts ambiguity 
problem occurs full text retrieval known paraphrase problem oard dorr 
overcome restricted vocabulary manual annotation controlled term indexing expensive manually index images large collection 
content image retrieval content image retrieval cbir query example qbe popular years 
cbir systems try return images visually similar example image similarity set low level image features 
features index images colour texture shape spatial layout 
studies exists features best match human perception kasturi liu picard partly subjectivity involved improbable feature set exists 
important problem content indexing fact visual similarity correspond semantic similarity 
feature set existed matches human vision retrieved images aren necessarily related example image semantic level 
problem known semantic gap causes current image retrieval systems retrieve example images women red dresses example image picture red car 
uncovering hidden semantics previous sections saw major problems context base image retrieval content image retrieval fact terms document words low level image features differ semantic content document 
doesn mean terms document totally meaningless 
humans things term term refer textual items term refers textual items words visual items low level image features term read indexing term 
set terms discover semantics document 
need technique uncovers hidden semantics document able disregard different term related documents 
latent semantic indexing uncover hidden semantics document latent semantic indexing lsi approach proven successful monolingual cross lingual text retrieval deerwester dumais harshman dumais landauer littman yang carbonell brown 
lsi method uses occurrence statistics terms find semantics document terms concluding documents similar terms probably related 
lsi example infer document containing words reservation double room shower breakfast related documents hotels word hotel mentioned particular document 
state art monolingual text lsi starts term document matrix represents term occurrences documents 
depending weighting cells matrix indicate term occurs document term occurs important term certain document 
term document matrix seen high dimensional representation document base document represented vector term occurrences 
dimension matrix reduced applying singular value decomposition svd form computes meaningful linear combinations terms documents 
take dimensions resulting matrices optimal approximation original term document matrix lower dimension 
lower dimensional space similar terms similar documents close image retrieval 
resulting lower dimensional space document containing words reservation double room shower breakfast close documents hotels close term hotel 
people searching term hotel find document term hotel 
lsi groups related concepts solve ambiguity document containing words bank money interest account cash dispenser closer documents financial institutes documents river banks 
combining text images learning field cross language retrieval lsi index documents multiple languages semantic space dumais landauer littman yang carbonell brown apply lsi build multi modal space terms text images represented 
latent semantic indexing image retrieval textual part combination content context image retrieval cascia sethi sclaroff far know combined text image semantic space latent semantic indexing 
basic principal building multi modal space hiemstra de jong quite simple just list terms modalities term document matrix apply svd resulting semantic space contains visual textual items see 
tree park tree sunny day park multi modal lsi documents term document matrix semantic space main difficulty lies choice terms 
terms image 
words normally lsi text retrieval replaced image features 
order lsi perform terms images similar type distribution ones text 
hand number possible image features high just total number terms document collection high 
hand number image features image low typical textual document contains small portion possible words 
different common terms content image retrieval number possible terms relatively low image value term 
apart image terms values continuous scale terms text discrete 
lsi image content define set discrete image terms roughly distribution set textual terms 
create set image terms small sparse set words text set cover visual characteristics images 
tried different approaches calculating image terms 
approach create set image terms roughly sparse set textual terms second approach create set image terms size set textual terms

experiments show sets best suitable image retrieval 
experiments compare combined lsi described section pure content pure context approaches collection images dutch newspaper captions collateral text available 
obviously collection far small perform extensive recall precision evaluations give idea possibilities limitations approach 
terms images extracted applying techniques described previous section terms text extracted captions selecting terms occur different documents 
lsi index document collection times visual terms textual terms terms image text combinations sets image terms 
test different distributions image features affected semantic space randomly selected documents collection query documents indexes retrieve similar documents query 
query compared top documents set turned results combined approach similar ones images approach holds sets image terms 
top returned documents combined index image index overlap sparse set image terms overlap small set image features 
combined index text index overlapped respectively 
manual inspection results confirmed visual similarity important semantic similarity 
percentage sets image features roughly small set image features perform somewhat better sparse set 
manual inspection results shows combined approach set features outperforms image text approach queries relevant documents data set

course single example proof viability approach shows combination textual visual terms yield better results separate approaches 
discussion research didn extensively experiment approach small set test data think latent semantic indexing promising method indexing visual multi modal data 
lsi find semantic associations terms help bridge semantic gap major problems image retrieval 
showed combination text images outperform text image approaches cases 
lsi ignores words useful finding named entities

text available image research investigate weather combined approach help building semantic space allows disclosure images text associated
