webminer system proposes sql query mechanism querying discovered knowledge form association rules sequential patterns :10.1.1.146.4557
techniques discussed subsequent sections 
pattern discovery web transactions discussed section analysis users accessing site critical determining effective marketing strategies optimizing logical structure web site 
unique characteristics client server model world wide web including differences physical topology web repositories user access paths difficulty identification unique users user sessions transactions necessary develop new framework enable mining process 
specifically number issues preprocessing data mining addressed mining algorithms run 
include developing model access log data developing techniques clean filter raw data eliminate outliers irrelevant items grouping individual page accesses semantic units transactions integration various data sources user registration information specializing generic data mining algorithms take advantage specific nature access log data 
preprocessing tasks preprocessing task data cleaning 
techniques clean server log eliminate irrelevant items importance type web log analysis just data mining 
discovered associations reported statistics useful data represented server log gives accurate picture user accesses web site 
elimination irrelevant items reasonably accomplished checking suffix url name 
instance log entries filename suffixes gif jpeg gif jpeg jpg jpg map removed 
related harder problem determining important accesses recorded access log 
mechanisms local caches proxy servers severely distort picture user traversals web site 
current methods try overcome problem include cookies cache busting explicit user registration 
detailed methods serious drawbacks 
cookies deleted user cache busting defeats speed advantage caching created provide disabled user registration voluntary users provide false information 
methods dealing caching problem include site topology referrer logs temporal information infer missing 
problem associated proxy servers user identification 
machine name uniquely identify users result users erroneously grouped user 
algorithm checks see incoming request reachable pages visited 
page requested directly linked previous pages multiple users assumed exist machine 
user session lengths determined automatically navigation patterns identify users 
heuristics involve combination ip address machine name browser agent temporal information identify users 
second major preprocessing task transaction identification 
mining done web usage data sequences page grouped logical units representing web transactions user sessions 
user session page user single visit site 
identifying user sessions similar problem identifying individual users discussed 
transaction differs user session size transaction range single page page user session depending criteria identify transactions 
traditional domains data mining point sale databases convenient method clustering page transactions smaller entire user session 
problem addressed 
discovery techniques web transactions user transactions sessions identified kinds access pattern mining performed depending needs analyst path analysis discovery association rules sequential patterns clustering classification 
different types graphs formed performing path analysis graph represents relation defined web pages objects 
obvious graph representing physical layout web site web pages nodes hypertext links pages directed edges 
graphs formed types web pages edges representing similarity pages creating edges give number users go page 
date involves determining frequent traversal patterns large sequences physical layout type graph 
path analysis determine frequently visited paths web site 
examples information discovered path analysis ffl clients accessed product starting proceeding new products product ffl clients accessed site started products ffl clients left site page 
rule suggests useful information product users tend take circuitous route page clearly marked 
second rule simply states majority users accessing site page main page assumed example idea include directory type information page 
rule indicates attrition rate site 
users don browse pages site prudent ensure important information contained pages common site entry points 
association rule discovery techniques generally applied databases transactions transaction consists set items 
framework problem discover associations correlations data items presence set items transaction implies certain degree confidence presence items 
context web usage mining problem amounts discovering correlations various files available server client 
transaction comprised set urls accessed client visit server 
example association rule discovery techniques find correlations ffl clients accessed web page url product accessed product ffl clients accessed special placed online order product 
usually transaction databases contain extremely large amounts data current association rule discovery techniques try prune search space support items consideration 
support measure number occurrences user transactions transaction logs 
discovery rules organizations engaged electronic commerce help development effective marketing strategies 
addition association rules discovered www access logs give indication best organize organization web space 
problem discovering sequential patterns find inter transaction patterns presence set items followed item time stamp ordered transaction set 
web server transaction logs visit client recorded period time 
time stamp associated transaction case time interval determined attached transaction data cleaning transaction identification processes 
discovery sequential patterns web server access logs allows web organizations predict user visit patterns helps targeting advertising aimed groups users patterns 
analyzing information web mining system determine temporal relationships data items ffl clients visited products done search yahoo past week keyword ffl clients placed online order product placed online order product days 
important kind data dependency discovered temporal characteristics data similar time sequences 
example may interested finding common characteristics clients visited particular file time period 
conversely may interested time interval day week particular file accessed 
discovering classification rules allows develop profile items belonging particular group common attributes
