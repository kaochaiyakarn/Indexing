acharya studied way devising prefetching algorithms update scenarios 
acharya extend previous study integration pull push broadcast disk approach 
pull operation clients explicitly request items sending messages server turn sends information back clients 
combining approaches beneficial server clients 
study assumes independent data channels front backchannel push operation back channel serves media pull operation 
available bandwidth shared channels 
study concludes extreme cases little contention server server overload pure pull pure push solutions respectively best options 
cases authors propose hybrid solution called interleaved push pull ipp allows clients backchannel send pull requests items appear broadcast channel server supports broadcast disks plus interleaved responses pulls 
ipp suffers bottleneck problems pull approach 
improve scalability ipp authors propose different techniques adjusting pull bandwidth expense push bandwidth 
introduces trade fast queue pull requests served versus fast broadcast delivery executed 
lower values percent available bandwidth pull bandwidth produce best results lightly loaded systems produce worse results saturated systems candidates dynamic loads

guaranteeing time constraints met important concern 
previous broadcast disks protocols failures ignored 
basic premise errors fetching data available channel deemed tolerable data available rebroadcast 
real time systems assumption may imply missing critical deadlines 
remedy problems bestavros proposes series broadcast disk organizations suitable real time environments usage adaptive information dispersal algorithm aida adds reliability broadcast 
bestavros presents different organizations flat rate monotonic slotted rate monotonic suitable real time environments 
flat organizations simplest server sends union data items needed client periodic fashion 
flat broadcast need guaranteeing worst case latency tolerable items strictest deadlines 
order guarantee bandwidth allocated 
organization wasteful bandwidth 
remedy rate monotonic organization broadcasts item rate inversely proportional time constraint 
item represents independent disk spinning rate reciprocal timing constraint associated item 
obviously extreme organization tries optimize bandwidth expense ease broadcast programming 
slotted rate monotonic organization achieves balance previous organizations coalescing data items put broadcast disk 
coalescence achieved partitioning data set bins 
items bin share broadcast disk identical worst case latencies 
fault tolerance achieved bestavros aida elaboration information dispersal algorithm ida rabin 
information dispersal takes file divides independent pieces dispersal way recombining pieces sufficient retrieve reconstruction 
aida uses ida adaptively decide amount redundancy broadcast
