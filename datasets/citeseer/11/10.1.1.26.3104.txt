modal logics propositional order melvin fitting dept mathematics computer science lehman college cuny ny mail fitting lehman cuny edu web page comet lehman cuny edu fitting january add machinery relation symbols terms propositional modal logic adding quantifiers 
ordinarily extension propositional 
terms allowed non rigid scoping mechanism usually written lambda abstraction introduced avoid ambiguity 
quantifiers really order logic exactly propositional 
propositional logics adding machinery produces decidable logic adding produces undecidable 
equality symbol language interpreted equality relation logics yield undecidable versions 
transitivity villain 
proof undecidability consists showing classical order logic embedded 
best known propositional modal logics decidable shown filtration produce finite models special characteristics proof procedure tableaus 
course order versions undecidable conservatively extend classical logic 
modal logics sense intermediate firstorder propositional dark daylight speak 
decidability obvious fact fails range modal logics 
state results properly appropriate machinery introduced 
syntax order logic involves simply admitting quantifiers needs relation symbols variables constant function symbols 
modal setting straightforward semantics allows terms non rigid different values different possible worlds 
happens ambiguity results 
standard example constant symbol interpreted non rigidly 
say true possible world mean true alternative world meaning holds designates alternative world 
say true designates possible property meaning alternative world holds designated back 
nonrigid lead different outcomes seeing de re de dicto distinction 
readings useful different purposes mechanism introduced disambiguate things 
time ago abstraction device proposed modal logic proved quite useful 
extensive study virtues 
defined properly suffice say readings just discussed correspond distinct syntactic expressions 
propositional modal logic mean characterized class frames 
propositional modal logic ll logic syntactically allows relation symbols constant symbols abstraction quantification 
keep things simple ll omit function symbols 
semantically ll extend possible world semantics domain interpret constant relation symbols 
ll take domain world world constant domain semantics ll allow constant symbols interpreted non rigidly

turn semantics 
usual machinery propositional modal logic domain provided supply objects serve values constant symbols variables 
constant symbols interpreted non rigidly functions mapping worlds objects 
likewise non rigid interpretation supplied relation symbols 
modal logics definition model amodel structure

non empty set domain 
mapping assigns constant symbol function ary relation symbol function power set dn constant function assigning equality relation member ll say model 
constant symbols interpreted non rigidly variables thought rigid

usual closed formulas specification valuation matter 
say quite sophisticated things syntax semantics

define formula abbreviations 
notice arbitrary instance de re implying de dicto specialized instance de dicto implying de re 
shown valid 
de dicto implies de re fact de re implies de dicto 
works way 
example involving equality convenient introduce abbreviation 
rigid characterizes called local rigidity 
rigid valid 
rigid says accessible worlds keeps designation 
ll need weaker notion saying accessible world move world recovers designation world
