current results research include integration top level ontologies ontology library formalization terminological knowledge umls metathesaurus 
overwhelming amount information available various data repositories especially web emphasizes relevance knowledge integration methodologies techniques facilitate data sharing 
need integration perceived years telecommunications networking quickly dramatically changing scenario 
increasing demand data sharing rely solid conceptual foundation order give semantics terabytes available different databases eventually traveling networks 
domains applications deal lack conceptual foundation 
example domain molecular biology schulze kremer reports interesting case relevance semantic mismatches 
apparently unambiguous concept gene may conceptualized different ways different genome data banks 
gdb gene dna fragment transcribed translated protein genbank dna region biological interest name carries genetic trait phenotype 
versione domain physiology semantic mismatches terminological repositories icd snomed iii 
example icd terms classified inflammatory diseases snomed iii separate taxonomy morphology containing properties structures produced inflammatory disease 
standalone application local terminological repository may able accomplish task serious flaws 
integrated application semantic mismatches constitute serious obstacle agent interface negotiating sharing information 
obvious solution mismatches having unique standardized conceptualization sense lexical item domain 
easy achievement constantly put discussion special needs users 
alternative solution domain independent solid conceptual foundation helps application repository represented unambiguously 
fact actual demand unique conceptualization unambiguous communication complex detailed concepts possibly expressed different languages leaving user free explicit conceptualization
