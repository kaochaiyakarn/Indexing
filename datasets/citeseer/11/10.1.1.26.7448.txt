economic approach artificial intelligence michael wellman university michigan artificial intelligence laboratory ann arbor mi usa wellman umich edu ai eecs umich edu people wellman appear acm computing surveys symposium artificial intelligence take economic approach typically invokes premises 
fundamental problem solved resource allocation 
second useful model behavior terms rationality abstraction 
third essential consider authority activity may decentralized 
premises increasingly adopted explicitly implicitly artificial intelligence growing numbers ai researchers working economic paradigm 
resource allocation computer scientists view program specification machine describable behaviorally terms input output relationship resulting computation 
machine product output representing value function point represented input 
find helpful view product higher level say solution posed problem 
inevitably problem bears course action embarked 
conceptions computation answering questions era human intermediaries necessary perform transduction computation action 
view computer decision machine decision resolution distinction potential courses action 
loss generality decision computation doyle really resource allocation 
choosing entails allocation attention activity resources thing lieu 
conversely allocation resources defines activities done done 
making choices appropriately involves weighing benefits activities done opportunity cost done 
far tautologies 
sure problem cast resource allocation concomitant advantage 
answer considering resources explicitly difficult express range courses action available defined configurations resources devoted various activities 
seriously acknowledging gradations value likelihood outcome allocations impossible account tradeoffs alternate activities 
widely recognized problem solving techniques developed ai research called classical planning need generalized accommodate uncertainty graded preferences 
decision theoretic planning hanks address problems adopting comprehensive framework principled resource allocation attempting retain useful computational representational techniques prior ai 
rationality abstraction microeconomic theory assumes individual agents rational acting achieve preferred outcome subject knowledge capabilities 
rationality abstraction single methodological feature distinguishes economics social sciences 
approach highly congruent artificial intelligence 
fifteen years ago newell proposed central characteristic ai practice particular abstraction level interpret behavior computing machines 
viewing system newell knowledge level entails attributing system knowledge goals available actions predicting behavior principle rationality specifies elements dictate action selection 
rationality applied matter coherence defining relation knowledge goals actions stand 
exactly bayesian view rationality standard economics knowledge goals beliefs preferences subjective notions constrained self coherence consistency coherence resulting behavior 
introducing knowledge level idea newell proposed particular basic rationality principle agent knowledge actions lead goals agent select action 
formulation criticized grounds having matters resource allocation graded preferences ad hoc auxiliary principles 
economic perspective satisfactory comprehensive rationality principle address choice alternate activities resource allocations accomplish goals varying degrees 
regardless particular expression point coherence rationality principle required order sense sorts agent attitudes knowledge belief preference intention commonly invoked ai research 
decentralization human societies computational power inherently distributed relatively small brains resident separate connected costly low bandwidth error prone communication channels 
authority activity separately controlled local computational units 
surprising economics focuses decentralized nature decision making 
primary aim discipline explain aggregate results alternate configurations interacting rational agents 
case decentralization computational environments communication usually direct configurations controllable straightforward

writing development promotion software agents necessarily derived ai technology prominent activity 
interpretations software agency vary widely typical conceptions involve autonomy action modularity scope interest interaction agents 
understanding influencing configurations software agents directly analogous problem faced economists 
economics problem synthesizing interaction protocol rational agents achieve socially desirable called mechanism design
