connectionism knowledge representation traditional view knowledge representation intelligent system means representing knowledge uses knowledge represented fundamental 
method chosen represent knowledge constrains done knowledge intelligent system perform 
traditionally finding method knowledge representation viewed finding language formal language predicate logic expressing knowledge concise manner 
linguistic approach knowledge representation exemplified description knowledge representation contained popular ai textbook russell norvig page object knowledge representation express knowledge computer tractable form help agents perform 
knowledge representation language defined aspects ffl syntax language describes possible configurations constitute sentences 
usually describe syntax terms sentences represented printed page real representation inside computer sentence implemented physical configuration physical property part agent ffl semantics determines facts world sentences refer emphasis original page possible principle define language sentence completely arbitrary interpretation 
practice representation languages impose systematic relationship sentences facts 
languages deal compositional meaning sentence function meaning parts 
emphasises key point knowledge representation representations normally compositional 
fodor pylyshyn argue compositionality essential cognitive architecture 
traditional symbolic systems compositionality achieved building representation complex proposition directly representation constituents 
example sentence john loves mary concatenates constituents john loves mary 
symbolic systems may concatenate symbols manner may build data structure pointers indicate relationship constituents 
way representation complex structure contains representation constituents building blocks 
resources representation directly proportional number constituents structure 
lead van gelder shall refer form compositionality concatenative compositionality 
final point note representations require method denoting symbol bit patterns represent symbol computer 
abstractly collection representational elements bit patterns arranged sort representational space computer memory 
form representational medium representations formed 
point mentioned russell norvig discussion importance discussed 
traditional knowledge representation focuses choosing representational language best suited particular task typically ignores representational medium 
shall illustrate choice representational medium may constrain forms processing knowledge just choice representational language 
connectionism altered traditional view knowledge representation start connectionism different concept representations 
symbolic representations involved collections discrete symbols connectionist representations involved patterns activity set neurons amount vectors typically real valued numbers 
representation object done units opposed single unit giving rise notion distributed representation apparent especially critique connectionism fodor pylyshyn neural networks difficulty handling tasks required compositional representations sort symbolic systems routinely 
compositional representation arbitrary size assignation node set nodes possible proposition infeasible 
needed way creating compositional representation number units directly related number constituents structure 
response fodor pylyshyn challenge techniques representing compositional structures neural networks soon developed recursive auto associative memories raams holographic reduced representations hrrs 
connectionist representational techniques involve methods combining vectors representing constituents structure create single vector representing structure 
case raams hrrs view promising techniques developed far representation complex structure vector size vectors representing constituents representations amenable processing standard neural models feed forward networks 
representations differ traditional compositional representations quite fundamentally 
complex structure instance represented concatenation constituents vector systematically related constituents mathematical transformations hand picked case hrrs learned case raams 
compositionality achieved process combining vectors representing constituents structure create single vector constituents extracted 
van gelder coined term functional compositionality describe 
development new way achieving compositionality lies claim new view knowledge representation opened 
connectionists rumelhart mcclelland volumes favoured approach tackled problem compositionality concatenative compositionality simply arose naturally linguistic form traditional representations 
showing compositionality achieved way altered traditional view knowledge representation 
representing structures fixed width vectors amenable processing standard neural models argued important consequence 
symbolic systems operated compositional structures finding symbol needs changed individually altering 
neural networks operate vectors holistically representing structures fixed width vectors possible operate symbolic structures holistically constituents structure processed simultaneously

applications holistic computation included logical inference holistic unification logical terms 
furthermore holistic representations known representations holistic computation possible sequential machines 
holistic representation complex structure represented representational element involved representing constituent structure element structure represented representational elements part 
isolate part structure isolating elements change single element results changes constituents structure 
hrrs holistic representations sense 
new form compositionality new forms representation allow new way processing compositional structures formed techniques 
representational medium involving vectors real valued numbers possible achieve compositionality way illustrates properties representational medium nature representational elements fact constrain forms processing possible particular method representation

page 
inferences representation directly accessing compositional structure said perform holistic inference 
page 
clear chrisman means inference occurs gestalt fashion mean constituents structure processed simultaneously constituents representation structure processed simultaneously 
representation processing constituents representation simultaneously involve processing constituents structure simultaneously 
holistic representation changing single representational element involves changes entire structure occurring simultaneously constituent structure altered simultaneously element representation changed 
representations constituents structure directly elements representation holistic computation occur operate representation 
chalmers claimed representations developed raams property distributed representations formed raams explicit original words reprint page

chalmers test representations directly see case
