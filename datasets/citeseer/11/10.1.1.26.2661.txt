difference postulates revision update explained intuitively follows 
suppose knowledge base revised sentence revision methods satisfy agm postulates exactly select models closest models notion closeness defined ordering relationship models satisfies certain conditions katsuno mendelzon 
models selected determine new theory denote ffi hand update methods select model knowledge base set models closest new theory describes union models 
suppose exactly models possible worlds described knowledge base 
suppose describes exactly worlds closer closer selected new knowledge base 
note knowledge base effectively forgotten possible world new fact evidence retroactive impossibility refuse model new knowledge base conclude old knowledge base 
doing revisions behaviour rational 
real world changed true new possible worlds forget old possible worlds grounds different know case 
hand suppose doing updates 
models possible worlds think real world know 
real world changed examine old possible worlds find minimal way changing model fact real world changed gives grounds conclude old worlds possible 
illustrate distinction update revision consider examples formally identical different intuitively desirable results

consider example formally identical desired result revision update 
suppose knowledge base describes state bit register read noisy communication lines 
propositional letters represents bit 
state register unchanging 
different readings obtained 
independent analysis circuits control register learn bits value 
possible patterns 
dalal revision method tells keep new knowledge base conclude relatively far possible patterns acceptable result 
argued better forget readings kb just keep possible worlds 
consider example register thousands bits long readings agree bit new fact says bits 
clearly waste information discard old kb just keep new fact
