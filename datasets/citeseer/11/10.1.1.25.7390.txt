spatial metaphors navigation complex information spaces finding information information space supported appropriate user interface metaphor fosters understanding information space structure 
information spaces need structure useful structure needs communicated user 
term information space hints spatial conceptualization underlying metaphor 
strong relationship spatial metaphors information visualization visualization communicates structure information space user navigation space possible 

basics navigation information visualization information space structure communicated user graphical representation space elements examples visualizations information visualizer navigational view builder system landscape metaphor visualizations system 
term visualization want stress representation structure necessarily visual 
visualizations spatial metaphors 
metaphor explicit influences visual design system 
explicit spatial structure data set useful represent data spatial metaphors talk structure spatial terms 
generally assumed spatial visualizations information structures help users learn structure information space 
navigation information spaces information systems contain information hypertext properties 
hypertext consists nodes containing information connected links 
users navigate structure directed links 
types information typical order necessarily true hypertext 
users easily lose orientation small hypertexts 
called getting lost hyperspace problem 
shortcoming hypertext concept failure hypertext user interface communicate structure information user 
users map information space structure tasks navigational activities 
mapping impossible apparent structure 
apparent key questions information navigation piece information property get information am relation 
spatial formulation questions indicates spatial conception navigation process 
note users inhabit position space history visited places user interface provides 

spatial user interface metaphors usefulness spatial metaphors intuitively understandable proven studies 
earlier studies 
spatial metaphors shortcomings need addressed basis information system 
advantage spatial organization schemes user initial familiarity 
people organize objects spatial way strongly developed spatial cognitive abilities 
highly developed methods describe access paths objects able understand follow route descriptions incomplete partly incorrect 
spatial arrangements express relationships objects difficult describe formal way spatial language describe complex relationships leave room ambiguity 
assumed visualizations better dimensional 
reports simpler flatter representation information structures learnt easier advanced visualizations 
example complex spatial relationships structure city overlapping neighborhoods districts 
city areas form strict hierarchy structure partial containment 
time city structure shows hierarchical properties promote understanding 
major shortcoming spatial metaphors scale badly 
desktop metaphor example 
users choose view files list spatial arrangement objects large number objects represented 
shows close relationship spatial metaphors information visualization elaborate visualization file space cone trees information visualizer scales better 
city metaphor addresses scaling providing global overviews form city maps 
people may familiar limited part city strategies navigate unknown parts reasonably maps available infrastructure interacting people 
reduces apparent size city addresses scaling problem 
magic features introduce city provide additional tool cope complexity large spaces 
necessary amount realism spatial filing useful form organization tasks involve large mass diverse objects entities 
key word diverse spatial filing objects look similar 
representing space objects realistically helps create necessary diversity 
detailed rendering metaphor source domain eases transfer preexisting knowledge target domain 
artificial environments enriched visualizing example usage information read wear 
idea history enriched objects wear real objects visualizing usage information highlights frequently promising objects 
examples group memories collaborative navigation concepts read wear see 
information richness systems support collaboration interaction users important ingredient provide call social navigation :10.1.1.51.1563
social navigation behavior users information systems freely share pointers information help users disoriented new system 
essentially social navigation happens inhabited city space people ask way inhabitants modify environment nicer personalized easier recognize navigate 
information world created inhabitants city may incomprehensible outsiders 
information kind close writing world concept 
current information systems seldom support user communities personalize information space way city metaphor logical thing support processes environment legible 
note word legible differs little concept legibility refers easy read learn city structure 
magic features deliberately breaking metaphor spatial organization universal cure navigation issues 
spatial arrangement determines distance effort cross distance objects 
conventional space effort proportional distance available navigational means 
information systems slow navigation just convey feeling distance probably accepted distances delays reach certain amount 
need provide shortcuts space may break relationship distance effort favor navigation speed appear lies outside underlying metaphor 
call magic features 
consistent spatial metaphor prohibit magic features loosening rules improve navigation information space 
happen controlled manner spatial metaphor confusing user 
magic features designed look differently rest system users recognize special 
provide shortcuts navigation large spaces effective tackle scaling issues 

motivation basic concepts information city main argument city metaphor cities provide structures scale relatively provide navigation tools cope space complexity 
argument city people know strategies navigate effectively unknown parts city 
cities hierarchical sense people mental representations cities contain overlapping elements 
elements describe complex relationships containment city metaphor including encapsulation access control 
addition people navigating city structures interacting people city environment 
know social protocols control interaction users inquiring locations asking way gaining access closed spaces

navigation tools distinguish transportation navigation tools 
navigation traditional sense consider transportation passive form navigation user moved navigation active process 
example consider difference taxi driving car 
taxi user instructs desired destination sits back ride 
hand driving car user choose route steer vehicle 
types navigation transport metaphors navigation task 
navigation walking navigation short distances 
uses paths squares open access structures 
walking half automatic address link close selected user decides follow red carpet 
driving metaphor fast walking covering medium distances 
flying long distance navigation 
transportation taxis cars constantly controlled user 
rom able navigate incomplete information 
provide guided tour 
subway provides long distance transport city 
set predefined stops coincide major landmarks 
leaving subway landmarks places user main lobby front landmark 
travel time gives rough indication distance traveled 
show environment traveled 
left predefined stops temporary subway outside buildings enter subway 
inside buildings elevators provide connection subway 
elevator user awareness leaving building 
subway tunnels city space 
connects distant points traveling locations travels different space walking user 
subway space concept connectedness 
movement somewhat detached space observed kevin lynch 
depending distance traveled users apply different navigation transportation tools need realized differently 
classification distance decides visual representation navigational activity enactment representation navigation process 
correct enactment helps users better understand navigating 
enactment provide necessary feedback user get disoriented navigation process 

information providers information providers information carrying entities city

walls signs facade building wall provides information contents building 
facades show read wear indicate usage visual cues indicate content building 
information walls information show read wear 
link information walls red carpet metaphor magic windows embedded 
links show usage 
information walls moved 
signs small information walls provide linking 
movable information objects removable information objects source domains writing pads books business cards contain information strictly associated location 
may available single objects may provided information create unlimited number information objects 
dispenser associated fixed location city information object movable 
examples metaphors include newspaper vending machine information kiosk
