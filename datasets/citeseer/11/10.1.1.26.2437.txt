user preference inferred site usage example purchasing book may taken evidence interest just book book author 
discussion primary strength collaborative filtering recommendations personalized 
extent nearest neighbors really similar taste find items wouldn thought quite find interesting 
second don go looking recommendation recommender simply state preferences receive recommendations 
computational view data representation simple uniform user item matrix cells represent ratings amenable different computational manipulations 
collaborative filtering simply support existing activity

leads naturally growth system knowledge better recommendations database leads database updated 
role uniformity bad aspects 
hand observed practice suggests people don want offer recommendations just want 
hand rating items particularly onerous precisely want recommendation 
collaborative filtering separates personal contact recommendation process need contact recommendation producer receiver 
course system designers wish results matching algorithm introduce people nearest neighbors 
excellent technique community formation people linked automatically share interests 
issues technical challenges collaborative filtering algorithms including rater sparsity problems 
recommendation item offered rated 
number people rated items relatively small compared number items database won significant similarity users 
turn means nearest neighbors hci new millennium jack carroll ed addison wesley really won near recommendations won 
problems urgent number items increases 
major tactic addressing problems combine collaborative filtering content recommenders 
simple example illustrate benefits hybrid systems 
example suppose user rated nba page com favorably rated nba page com favorably 
pure collaborative filtering find match users 
content analysis show items fact quite similar indicating match users 
fab system builds intuition 
analyzes content items users rate favorably build content profiles user interest 
applies collaborative filtering techniques identify users similar interests 
effort grouplens research group experimenting collaborative filtering technique combine opinions users personal information filtering agents 
researchers analyzed problem incentives generalization rater problem theoretically 
issue rate get benefit wait rate benefit 
avery carried game theoretic analysis incentive systems encourage optimal quantity order ratings 
billsus pazzani took approach addressing problems collaborative filtering

take singular value decomposition initial ratings matrix extract features apply learning algorithm neural network 
exploiting latent structure user ratings latent semantic analysis exploits latent structure text system greatly reduces need users rate common items user serve predictor 
experiments showed approach significantly outperformed previous collaborative filtering algorithms 
aggarwal invented new graph theoretic approach collaborative filtering appears avoid limitations previous algorithms 
particular compute accurate recommendations sparse data 
system offers results people basis significant computational processing collaborative filtering system faces issue explanation system think item 
herlocker proposes techniques explaining recommendations computed collaborative filtering system experiments evaluating efficacy explanations 
final important issue concerns notion serendipity 
stated informally want recommender system tell don know 
current systems fail test 
example authors terveen uses amazon com recommendation center 
terveen rated number items system recommended shakespeare macbeth rated positively indicating 
point system began recommend shakespeare plays king hamlet twelfth night 
familiar hci new millennium jack carroll ed addison wesley shakespeare unaware rest plays 
recommendations carried new information 
situations common 
generalize shakespeare example may seldom useful recommend books author rated books author highly 
analogous argument cds artists 
fact argument strengthened 
rates cds highly person highly opinion cds hole foo fighters overlap relationships members groups 
system improved knowledge correlations user opinions items user opinion item quite opinion item approach problem build knowledge items essentially creating hybrid content collaborative system 
aggarwal algorithm incorporates hierarchical classification structure called creative recommendations span categories 
scheme serve basis making serendipitous recommendations 
challenging ultimately scalable approach invent algorithms determine sorts correlations automatically 
experimenting technique billsus pazzani may promising place start 
current challenges new opportunities close considering current challenges recommender systems 
set challenges concerns issues bringing people communities interest 
major concern respecting people privacy 
second challenge create recommendation algorithms combine multiple types information probably acquired different sources different times 
forming supporting communities interest naturally occurring communities laboratories challenge study learn better support naturally occurring communities 
example spoken roles recommendation seeker recommender preference provider treated distinct assumptions may hold real communities 
observations weblogs illustrate 
slashdot com known weblog web community slogan news

slashdot started people place collect discuss information interesting 
grew rapidly soon fell prey problems information overload weblog tries avoid 
dozens stories thousands comments posted day read 
slashdot editor developed interesting moderation mechanism see slashdot com moderation shtml cope problem 
slashdot participants limited moderation powers

human participants communities may need recommender systems 
want maintain faq contribute weblog matter motivated impossible read evaluate information web reasonably broad topic 
human recommender need recommender system 
different types recommender systems suggest content 
contentbased recommender observe documents editor considers inclusion note ones selects rejects gradually evolve filter capture preferences 
social data mining systems mine relevant newsgroups continuously crawl analyze relevant web localities new popular items 
social recommender systems editor gets access opinions different individuals sort community pulse 
come new ideas information 
content recommender hand editor get suggestions items items selected past 
may lead coherent narrow static offering information 
forming communities automatically respecting privacy recommender systems link people shared interests 
systems mine preferences activity records choose convey identity people produced preferences 
collaborative filtering systems may communicate set neighbors compute recommendation 
case users system opportunity contact form community share interests 
opportunity raises significant privacy concerns 
concerns acute social data mining systems extract information original context 
consider phoaks example extracts preferences concerning web pages newsgroup messages aggregates preferences recommendations available web site 
presumably people view web site participants original newsgroup 
way information processed new audience access results intended foreseen original producers information 
system designer various choices balancing individual group privacy opportunities expanded contacts people 
play safe information aggregated decontextualized 
phoaks mean presenting ordered lists recommended urls information recommending messages persons posted recommenders 
results rich informative recommendations gives opportunity people new contacts share interests 
second explicit 
example hci new millennium jack carroll ed addison wesley designed phoaks identify recommenders prominent technically easy contact recommender including mailto links 
chose go far 
included email addresses recommenders top level 
phoaks users want find information dig bit want email recommenders explicitly cut paste email addresses 
generally interested middle ground solutions lie extremes complete disclosure complete anonymity 
place start techniques places online dating services 
cases system trusted intermediary mediating interaction people 
participants progressively reveal system login personal email address information comfortable 
combining multiple types information compute recommendations authority expertise just similarity taste basis collaborative filtering algorithms matching people similar interests 
getting recommendations somebody similar tastes start want person making recommendation expert topics 
prefer getting recommendation opinions expert people interests somewhat closer 
raises multiple challenges including obtaining expertise information qualifying information combining information similarity preferences compute recommendation 
various techniques getting information expertise may explored 
example online conversation metrics amount messages person contributes number responses messages receive assess participant expertise 
academic contexts citation indexing methods 
consideration expertise topic specific example music domain person expert baroque music big band swing third rock 
techniques may help categorize person expertise 
system categorical information items genre person rates items category highly genres may indicate expertise category 
conversational application messages individual produces may analyzed extract topics discusses frequently 
realize discussing topic lot doesn necessarily expert place experimenting 
final issue combine expertise taste information 
existing collaborative filtering algorithms simply tweaked term weights neighbors influence recommendation expertise 
weight assign clear priori experiments necessary different combinations appropriate different circumstances 
combining multiple sources preferences thinking combining expertise preference information leads realization preferences obtained different sources algorithms hci new millennium jack carroll ed addison wesley able combine different types preferences appropriately 
example preferences phoaks obtained mining aggregating opinions usenet messages 
phoaks users able rate recommended urls system captured usage history url browsed 
sources preferences urls mentions newsgroup messages usage history explicit ratings 
combine types preferences challenge clear weight assign type 
analysis usage history particular requires thought 
example simply counting number times users clicked url preference measure obvious strategy 
expect users click urls higher display list 
building intuition deviation expected pattern urls clicked significantly frequently expected probably needs considered 
example illustrates interesting general point recommendation decision may yield additional preference data evolve recommendation 
single user may play multiple roles recommendation seeker preference producer simultaneously 
recommender systems developed response manifest need helping people deal world information abundance overload 
clear link people people share interests just relevant information 
identified set major issues recommender systems preference data obtained roles played people computation types communication involved algorithms linking people computing recommendations presentation recommendations users 
identified major approaches recommender systems distinguished large part issues address address
