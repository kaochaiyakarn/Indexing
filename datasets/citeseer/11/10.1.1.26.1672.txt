approach compare information needs car drivers pedestrians investigate data sets navigation systems car drivers city maps capability support specific needs pedestrians 
results improve location services mobile users 
people move unfamiliar environments need precise instructions reach specific location 
mobile phones communicators personal digital assistants provide navigation instructions real time accessing wireless internet 
positioning methods global positioning system gps global system mobile telecommunication gsm pedestrian navigation services continuously frequently updated information updating path user guided

digital city maps digital street maps find elements match needs users exploring city environment foot public transport 
comparing driver navigation systems travel paths pedestrians form network information information completely different instructions created guide car drivers 
example pedestrian network need single street lanes foot need part street network provided streets takeuchi 
hand elements added double way directions road pedestrian malls 
typical distances moving foot city smaller compared ones covered cars reduce scale factor new series details perceivable
