second case model interaction system assessment current state hidden students 
system uses information decisions moderate group 
fundamentally paradigms data collected model interaction constructed instantiated represent current state possibly desired state decisions proceed 
difference approaches lies locus processing see 
systems collect interaction data construct visualizations data place locus processing user level systems advise process information directly 
benefits coaching student interaction human computer clear correct diagnosis appropriate remedial actions 
students learn visualizations data indicators
