conversational recommendation systems large set items description user needs recommendation systems user small set items suited requirements 
widely framework recommendation systems ranked list approach 
scheme user specifies needs keywords system presents usually long list results ordered predicted relevance user 
technique comes information retrieval originally designed help find documents reports library research 
basic method quite general underlies search engines world wide web millions regularly quite different selection tasks 
despite current popularity ranked list scheme approach making recommendations

interaction supported conversational systems quite different ranked list approach 
important distinction inquirer hears complete item choices remain 
overwhelmed items compete attention user interacts advisor narrow choices iterative manageable fashion

table summarizes operators supported adaptive place advisor 
consider operators available dialogue manager advancing conversation 
obvious ask constrain involves asking user provide value attribute 
example conversation saw examples operator advisor asking questions cuisine quality food payment options location city 
cases process introducing constraint produce situation items satisfactory 
occurs dialogue manager applies ask relax asks user wants drop particular constraint 
operator suggest values answers user query possible values attribute

conversation reduced number alternatives manageable size dialogue manager invokes recommend item operator proposes complete item user 
clarify operator invoked system uncertain user said low speech recognition certainty value applicable attribute 
turn operators system assumes available user 
central action user take provide constrain involves specifying value attribute 
value attribute just asked system value different attribute replacement previously specified value 
example included instances operator response questions cuisine city answering question different posed system replacing previously provided value cuisine 
answer constrains items system considers presentation user advances dialogue goal identifying satisfactory items 
saw place advisor assume user answer questions 
person decides proposed attribute inappropriate relevant factor reject attribute replace 
reject constrain operator captures explicit rejection 
saw example inquirer specify restaurant quality replied don care long cheap 
addition user explicitly accept reject proposals system say relaxing certain attribute accept relax reject relax complete item accept item reject item 
user query available attributes query attributes possible values attribute table dialogue operators supported adaptive place advisor system operators ask constrain asks question obtain value attribute ask relax asks question remove value attribute suggest values suggests small set possible values attribute suggest attributes suggests small set unconstrained attributes recommend item recommends item satisfies constraints clarify asks clarifying question uncertain user performed operator user operators provide constrain provides value attribute reject constrain rejects proposed attribute accept relax accepts removal value attribute reject relax rejects removal value attribute accept item accepts proposed item reject item rejects proposed item query attributes asks system information possible attributes query values asks system information possible values attribute start asks system re initialize search quit asks system abort search query values saw cuisine

retrieval engine retrieval engine adaptive place advisor retrieves items suitable users request match preferences 
retrieval engines casebased reasoning systems usually indifferent users preferences 
calculate similarity items case base query similarity metrics weighting factors domain model 
adaptive place advisor take current status conversation preferences user account 
current status conversation determines attributes query values associated 
values represent user explicit choices generate sql query retrieve items match values

selection attribute constrained relaxed information gain measure 
attribute constrain selected determining attribute lowest entropy highest information gain attributes user constrained 
items returned new database query attribute highest entropy lowest information gain respect case base query selected attributes user constrained far suggested relaxation

summary described initial version adaptive place advisor intelligent assistant designed help people select destination example restaurant 
recommendation systems accept keywords produce ranked list carries conversation user progressively narrow options
