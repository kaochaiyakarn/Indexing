chapter correspondence problem nehaniv kerstin dautenhahn 
matching imitation identification form social learning imitation copying mimicry presupposes notion correspondence autonomous agents 
judging behavior transmitted socially requires observer identify mapping demonstrator imitator 
demonstrator imitator similar bodies animals species similar age gender human observer obvious correspondence map corresponding body parts left arm demonstrator maps left arm imitator right eye demonstrator maps right eye imitator tail demonstrator maps tail imitator 
obvious correspondence actions raising left arm model corresponds raising left arm imitator production vocal signals model corresponds production acoustically similar ones imitator picking fruit demonstrator corresponds picking fruit type imitator 
furthermore correspondence sensory experience audible sounds touch visible objects colors evidently detected experienced similar ways 
take correspondence relatively clear case 
humans imitating recognizing correspondences 
clear animals robots software programs may fact generally fail recognize correspondences 
judge produced behavior copy observed require respects correspondence 
faithfulness precision behavioral match obviously vary absolute cutoff threshold exists defining success opposed failure behavioral matching 
study degree success various metrics measures correspondence nehaniv dautenhahn see 
turns obvious correspondences similar bodies mentioned ones possible 
consider human imitating facing demonstrator raises left arm imitator raise left arm 
raise right mirror image demonstrator actions 
demonstrator picks brush imitator pick brush 
just brush type 
demonstrator opens container get chocolate inside imitator open similar container way unwrapping tearing surrounding just open container 
different possible answers questions presuppose different correspondences
