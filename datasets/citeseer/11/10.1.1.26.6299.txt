mutual bootstrapping information extraction systems designed extract specific types information text 
categories interest defined advance usually require extraction noun phrases nps names people companies locations 
purposes semantic lexicon just refers dictionary words semantic category labels 
tasks set possible extractions finite 
example extracting country names text straightforward easy define list countries 
tasks require extraction potentially open ended set phrases 
example impossible enumerate noun phrases describe person location 
systems semantic lexicon known phrases dictionary extraction patterns recognize relevant noun phrases 
example system identify locations semantic lexicon lists country names states rely extraction patterns recognize location phrases cities neighborhoods general descriptions downtown northwest region 
semantic lexicon support semantic constraints extraction patterns

recall precision baseline lexicon union web web location web title table recall precision results web test set table shows seed words achieved high precision locations titles low recall 
low precision companies mainly due presence seed word list extremely common extracts referents specific names 
count referents legitimate extractions experiments 
second column lexicon shows semantic lexicons useful extracting information new web pages 
lexicon achieved recall precision locations titles 
results companies substantially lower baseline 
hypothesize set possible names larger set due time constraints hand labeled noun phrases extracted candidate patterns produced autoslog 
locations titles corporate web pages probably need generate larger lexicon names achieve results category 
third column union shows lexicon extraction patterns identify new information slightly increases recall locations titles slightly decreased precision 
retrospect realized probably need extraction patterns 
experiment patterns score produced title extraction patterns extraction patterns 
patterns represent specific linguistic expressions probably need lower threshold 
plan consider schemes allowing semantic lexicon extraction patterns vote possible extractions 
bootstrapping powerful technique leveraging small amounts knowledge acquire domain knowledge automatically 
important aspect bootstrapping mechanism generates domainspecific dictionaries 
example location dictionary generated web pages contained mainly country names cities location dictionary generated terrorism articles contained cities towns latin america 
generating domain specific dictionaries strength dictionaries tailored domain interest 
categories may behave strangely anticipate role domain 
example tried bootstrapping technique semantic category vehicle terrorism corpus resulting dictionaries looked remarkably similar weapon dictionaries 
retrospect realized vehicles weapons terrorism texts car bombs fighter planes 
domain considering vehicles weapons usually sense 
summary shown multi level bootstrapping produce high quality dictionaries variety categories 
bootstrapping method advantages previous techniques learning information extraction dictionaries semantic lexicon dictionary extraction patterns acquired simultaneously special training resources needed 
algorithm needs corpus unannotated training texts small set seed words input 
resulting semantic lexicon need manually inspected get rid bad entries done minutes 
multilevel bootstrapping appears promising approach acquiring domain knowledge automatically hope apply technique knowledge acquisition tasks
