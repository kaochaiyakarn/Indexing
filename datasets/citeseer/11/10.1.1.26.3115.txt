ontology 
ontology study concern kinds things exist entities things universe 
computer science view ontology somewhat narrower ontology working model entities interactions generically cyc ontology particular domain knowledge practice molecular biology bioinformatics 
definition ontology may take variety forms necessarily include vocabulary terms specification meaning 
includes definitions indication concepts inter related collectively impose structure domain constrain possible interpretations terms 
gruber defines ontology specification conceptualisations help programs humans share knowledge 
conceptualisation knowledge world terms entities things relationships hold constraints 
specification representation conceptualisation concrete form 
step specification encoding conceptualisation knowledge representation language 
goal create agreed vocabulary semantic structure exchanging information domain 
specification encoding ontology explored section 
main components ontology concepts relations instances axioms 
concept represents set class entities things domain 
protein concept domain molecular biology 
concepts fall kinds 
primitive concepts necessary conditions terms properties membership class 
example globular protein kind protein hydrophobic core globular proteins hydrophobic core things hydrophobic core globular proteins 

defined concepts description necessary sufficient thing member class 
example eukaryotic cells kinds cells nucleus 
eukaryotic cell nucleus nucleus containing cell eukaryotic 
relations describe interactions concepts concept properties 
relations fall broad kinds 
taxonomies organise concepts sub super concept tree structures 
common forms specialisation relationships commonly known kind relationship 
example enzyme kind protein turn kind 
relationships describe concepts part concepts protein 

associative relationships relate concepts tree structures 
commonly examples include nominative relationships describe names concepts protein context bioinformatics gene 
locative relationships describe location concept respect chromosome nucleus 
associative relationships represent example functions processes concept involved properties concept protein receptor protein transcription protein species 
types relationships exist causative relationships described 
relations concepts organised taxonomies 
example subdivided 
relations properties capture knowledge relationships concepts 
include restricted universally necessary relationship hold concept 
example describing protein database want say protein holds universally proteins 
relationship optionally hold concept example want describe enzyme cofactor describes possibility enzymes cofactor enzymes cofactor 
concept relationship links restricted certain kinds concepts 
example protein receptor restricts relation link concepts kinds receptors 
protein says protein function restrict kind concept function 
cardinality relationship 
example particular accession number protein chromosome may genes 
relationship transitive example protein transcription transcription protein 
taxonomy relations property 
conceptualisation concrete see section ontology produced 
instances things represented concept human instance concept protein
