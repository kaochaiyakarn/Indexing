agents negotiate terms trades exchanging asynchronous messages auctions 
auction mechanism defines rules determining prices allocations function agents messages 
agents bidding policies govern interaction auctions 
key distinction mechanism control system designers bidding policies determined individual agents 
elements constitute market protocol 

auction mechanism task allocation market includes simultaneous auction potential value 
agent regularly sends new bid messages goods wishes buy sell agent wish change bid leaves previous bid standing auction 
bid specifies price agent willing buy sell 
auction receives new bid sends bidders price quote message specifying price result auction ended current bid state 
multiple agents may bid price price quote reports bidder quantity buy sell current state 
agents may choose revise bids response notifications 
auction sends price quote agent includes id bid received agent 
agent responds price quote reflects bid sent 
agent follow policy may difficulty establishing feasibility asynchronous system 
bidding continues quiescence state messages received agent chooses revise bids auction changes allocation 
point auctions clear bidder notified final prices units 
note quiescent economy may solution state valid invalid 
auction runs st price rules 
st price auction uniform price generalization second price vickrey auction allows sale purchase multiple units 
set bids including units offered sale st price auction sets price equal st highest bids 
price said separate winners losers winners include sell bids strictly price buy bids strictly price 
order maximize trade agents producer relies price quote output reflect bid may incorrectly think winning output 
policy described section may increase bids inputs 
result situations producers continue incorrectly raise bids establish feasibility 
problem occur id reporting 
bid st price win tie breaking rule 
winning buy sell bids matched oneto 
producers technologies complementary ensuring feasibility challenging problem 
inspired fcc actions designed auctions run simultaneously reject agent bid increase previous bid see preliminary analysis simultaneous ascending auctions 
design helps give producers accurate indication relative prices inputs outputs 
show section bid restriction serves key role establishing relationships system quiescence solution convergence economy 

bidding policies mas designers generally control agents behaviors outcome protocol assumptions behaviors 
analysis assumes agents follow simple bidding policy described section 
variations may reasonable better respects policies describe 
explore range possibilities chose investigate particular set policies depth 
chosen policies respect ascending bid restriction enforced auction agent autonomy agent utilizes private information agents system 
suppliers consumer optimization problems simply maximize minimize respectively difference reserve price prices transact 
assume agents behave strategically simply place fixed bids respective reserve prices 
auction rules ensure policy result nonnegative surplus value 
producer optimization problem complex maximize difference price receives output total price pays inputs remaining feasible 
producer places new bid output price equal sum expected input prices sum exceeds previous bid 
input define expected price producer price quote price quote indicated winning small finite amount price quote price quote indicated losing 
producer initially bids zero input goods gradually increases bids ensure feasibility 
producer raise bid input small finite amount ffi price quotes indicate losing winning output 
note negotiation producers place bids output goods received commitments input goods 
producers counteract potential risk continually updating bids price changes feasibility status

quiescence reached price reaches consumer reserve price valid solution 
theorem market reaches quiescence price system state represents valid solution 
proof 
producer feasible change input bids economy reached quiescence 
active producer price output total price input goods increase output bid economy reached quiescence

auction guarantees mapping successful buy bids successful sell bids

agent reduces sell bids 

agent won sell bid bid price quote 
proof 
recall consumer bids reserve price

property satisfied 
property satisfied agents decrease bids 
producer won sell bid bid current quote 
definition valid solution producer active current price output total current price inputs 
active producer bid higher current price output 
combined fact suppliers change bids satisfies property 
say tie breaking consistent consecutive set bids auction breaks ties way 
theorem economy valid solution state auctions break ties consistently sell bids currently lost due tie breaking subsequent price quote auction economy quiescent state valid solution 
proof 
refer properties enumerated lemma 
recall current price tie breaking separates winning bids losing bids submitted prior 
property know current price consistent tie breaking separate winning buyers losing buyers price quote 
properties fact sell bids currently lost tie breaking ensure current price separate winning sellers losing sellers price quote

current price separate winners losers price quote price change price quote
