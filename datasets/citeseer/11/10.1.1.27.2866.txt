paragraphs briefly introduce basic notions procedures conceptual data analysis application database marketing 
philosophically grounded formalization concept see conceptual data analysis allows data mathematically treated processed 
formal concept analysis mathematical theory underlying conceptual data analysis formalizes concept conceptual hierarchy reflect philosophical understanding concept unit thought constituted extension intension 
extension comprises objects belonging concept intension consists attributes valid objects 
allow mathematical description extension intension formal concept analysis starts formal context definition 
formal context set structure sets binary relation gm 
elements called formal objects attributes respectively gim read object attribute 
derivations defined gim gim formal concept formal context pair sets called extent intent formal concept 
relation formalized 
set formal concepts order relation complete lattice called concept lattice denoted 
concept lattices graphically represented line diagrams proven useful representations understanding conceptual relationships data 
illustrate examples introduce notion valued context formalization data tables reports objects consideration specific values respect attributes 
order obtain concept lattice valued context context formally transformed formal context called valued context 
transformation performed conceptual scales reflect specific interpretations data
