speech auditory interface commotion meant carried user times definition location reminders arrive user busy doing driving walking factors suggest core memo management functions alerting speech input auditory cues 
speech suitable portable applications speakers microphones small require little power 
auditory input output performed user hands eyes busy driving 
importantly performing multiple tasks effective terms cognitive resources tasks performed different sensory modalities 
main downside auditory interface speech recognition difficult accuracy remains poor especially noisy environments 
addition speech transitory serial nature difficult take auditory glance list pick important item 
presentation text speech synthesis greater cognitive load placed user 
effective speech user interfaces exploit advantages minimizing user frustration due error cognitive load 
influenced commotion ways 
limited set functions available voice related hearing modifying lists reminders 
limiting functionality allows smaller speech recognizer vocabularies resulting better recognition performance 
frequently commotion functions speech accessible users forget say invoke increasing frustration recognizer 
actual reminders created voice simply saved digitized audio attempting dictation text visual feedback tedious best 
past explored giving spoken driving directions commotion limits map features graphical interface simplicity 
different auditory cues associated various types information lists reminders subscribed content information 
user pending messages relevant context pertinent audio cue heard 
purpose cues alert user distracting primary task different ones chosen way may subtle wishes 
system default cues currently list ding reminders subscribed information 
new default cues may chosen consensus users preferences 
user interacts system speech commands commands intuitive 
commotion run terse verbose mode 
verbose mode user receive auditory feedback speech command recognized system repeat command performing task 
example user says read item system repeat read item synthesizes plays back relevant list item 
auditory cue explain reason cue 
instance items grocery list 
choosing locations list names user says system respond example bank 
speech recognition fragile speech commands recognized mis recognized causing unwanted action performed 
visual interface user generally perceive system doing audio interface transparent user 
explicit feedback beneficial especially novice users
