extended john rushby computer science laboratory sri international menlo park ca usa rushby csl sri com requirements engineering information security poses main challenges eliciting requirements particular system figuring specify way perspicuous problem owner useful developer 
short note look challenges specify security requirements kind requirements may expect encounter 
specify security requirements 
prejudice specification security requirements best undertaken formal methods 
formal methods allow requirements specifications refinements examined mechanized calculation symbolic execution model checking theorem proving valuable allows reviews supplemented replaced analyses 
am terms sense employed guidelines software commercial aircraft section reviews processes depend human judgment consensus analyses objective mechanical processes testing calculation 
course certain questions require human judgment decisions require consensus issues better addressed analyses reviews analyses systematic checked automated 
especially automated analyses reliable thorough reviews cheaper 
human time talent issues really require judgment consensus see 
main approaches specifying requirements formal manner way describe model system characteristics required stipulate acceptable implementation refinement suitable sense model 
way specify requirements constraints satisfied acceptable implementation 
security requirements proven unusually uniquely troublesome approaches 
classical bell la formulation military multilevel security model specification exhibits problems approach security requirements specification 
interpret subjects objects model terms elements intended application 
aspects system state behavior overlooked may provide channels undesired communication despite verification application complies model 
channels kind multics interpretation intended exemplify utility approach 
model proved restrictive aspects behavior real systems trusted subjects introduced allowed violate restrictions model 
problem approach overarching security specification constrain behavior trusted sub jects effective way calculate properties behavior system 
bell la model illustrates need care interpreting formal demonstrations consistency security requirements specifications useful ways examine formal requirements specification check consistent alternative formulation entails expected property 
basic security theorem bell la demonstration kind advanced authors evidence model captures essence security 
mclean refuted claim establishing essentially identical theorem model clearly violates reasonable notion security 
problem basic security theorem consequence underlying state machine model security requirements layered top 
difficulties bell la model approach security requirements specification motivations development alternative property approach 
seen developed basis checking multilevel security information flow analysis generalized noninterference 
noninterference works nicely sequential systems multilevel security properties proved difficult generalize distributed systems nonhierarchical policies 
distributed systems challenge find natural formulation security compositional property secure systems joined suitable way result secure system 
straightforward extensions noninterference compositional compositional straightforward early versions restrictiveness unintuitive 
problems nonhierarchical policies similar applications wish specify information may flow directly intransitive policies surprisingly difficult specify correctly witness sequence papers identifying flaws predecessor attempt capture idea 
reason property formulations security requirements proved difficult security property 
technically property predicate equivalently subset traces system 
liveness safety properties important classifications known property expressed conjunction safety liveness property 
difficulty noninterference specifications security predicates traces properties predicates sets traces higher order 
tell particular trace represents run information flows say knowing trace looks absent 
suspect character certain formulations security tricky 
suspect difficulties inherent mere artifacts technical methods specify noninterference 
evidence suspicion note security requirements naturally expressed counterfactual terms 
counterfactual statements concern hadn driving fast crashed 
computer security statements information flows sees different behavior taken away certificate authorizes action signed 
counterfactuals long studied philosophers logicians psychologists linguists see counterfactual research news web page www sfu ca counterfactual fair say analysis poses problems 
issue consider simply subtract event interested produce inconsistent impossible world world born children adjustments sure adjustments cause consequences wish investigate 
computer systems avoid philosophical difficulties considering possible worlds event variations precise definition possible trace essentially time ordered sequence giving history values passed communications channels system event corresponds value sent channel trace sequence events recorded order occurrence simultaneous events recorded arbitrary order 
interest occur faced technical difficulties similar noninterference 
course restrictions behaviors enforce computer system properties kind enforcement mechanisms decisions basis part current run trace seen far argued safety properties schneider gives sharper characterization 
subtle noninterference enforced property corresponding bell la shown strong 
behaved properties compositional avoid lot difficulty high formulations security requirements focusing earth shadows cast properties 
arguments philosophical practical 
philosophical closer real requirements get straight prove properties enforce stronger shadows 
practical concerns analysis implementations refinements called formal contexts 
security requirements concern happen preserved standard notions functional refinement demand refinement implementation specification 
restriction doing allow violation security requirements protect files implementation allows access raw disk 
means verify design respect property shadow security requirement simply verify implementation refinement design need security preserving notion refinement need directly verify implementation security requirements 
believe choices require fundamental requirement 
specify 
multilevel security related notion information flow considered somewhat today important manage sensitive information relevant name partitioning concerned fault containment safety critical systems 
interest focussed needs ecommerce including interesting problems copyright protection contract signing collapse dot led conclude business internet share opinion heard expressed stuart card xerox parc internet seriously continue shape new requirements security 
opinion influenced projections imminent arrival ubiquitous computing evolve combination universal communications radio technology bluetooth yards broadband packet radio ricochet technology mile essentially free broadband wireline long distance connecting small cheap internet enabled devices costs dollars ip address

trivial scenario throw shirt washing machine comment 
shirt button computer knows talks computers places visit able tell washing machine dinner 
washing machine contacts restaurant examines order

contacts manufacturer downloads best program choice shirt button knows type shirt 
technology may result slightly cleaner shirts certainly result recording mining information previously went unnoticed computers involved scenario send selection advertisements restaurants tomato sauce shirts sell news interest items computer planet 
scenario may little exaggerated illustrates think dominant security issues concern privacy quality integrity information associated individuals transactions 
familiar supermarket loyalty cards allow record purchase browser cookies track online habits wireless technologies tell time 
privacy facets surely ability separate different aspects lives employer know spend spare time 
clearly threatened ubiquitous surveillance 
public concern may generate market selective anonymity anonymity accountability concepts precise requirements quite challenging capture 
issues attempting simultaneously satisfy requirements privacy accountability integrity accuracy illustrated concerns voting usa see rebecca web page www com html 
information gathered obtained knowledge cooperation checks accuracy integrity 
look credit report know false picture created sloppy incomplete recording 
inaccurate credit reports nuisance serious consequences recorded similarly sloppy manner 
hope truly important information medical history gathered treated care jurisdictions may medical smart card carried french citizens solutions decentralized societies interesting challenge 
personal information recorded completely accurately stakes raised traditional security requirements authentication identity theft increasingly common devastating victims 
certainly legal regulatory action needed address issues believe information security community take lead articulating requirements developing mechanisms place control possible hands individual citizen 
genuine benefits provided accurate complete personal information available automatic detection multiple drug prescriptions having potentially harmful interactions feasible citizens confidence allow collection integration 
articulating requirements developing mechanisms allow individuals measure control information collected urgent reactive activity response trends underway 
dual proactive endeavor identify opportunities early focus security requirements mechanisms enable development new services improved delivery services benefit 
mind include activities involve authentication 
show person employ service physical passport get visa

reasons usa forces globalization spread trend particularly california seen significant reduction reliability 
individuals extent protect unreliability means control subscribing ser vices buying generator 
trend decentralization complicates regulation control security privacy integrity information time quantity detail information gathered set explode 
individuals ability compensate inadequate security inadequate reliability services
