principles cinematography film considered linear sequence frames helpful think film having structure 
highest level film sequence scenes captures specific situation action 
scene film composed shots 
single shot covers small portion movie camera turned turned 
typically film comprised large number individual shots shot duration lasting second length tens seconds 
camera placement directors specify camera placements relative line interest imaginary vector connecting actors directed line actor motion oriented direction actor facing

line internal external parallel apex parallel external camera placement specified relative line interest 
adapted shooting actor camera position called parallel camera placement 
filming position yields internal reverse placement
