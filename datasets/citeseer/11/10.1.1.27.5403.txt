record corresponds relevant information patient 
profile contains personal information age race smoker 
measurements patient weight heart rate blood pressure included 
existence certain diseases stored 
diagnostics medical doctor technician included 
time attributes mainly involve medical history dates 
complex set measurements estimate degree disease certain regions heart healthy certain regions remain quality numbers summarize patient heart effort stress relaxed conditions

cases missing value may mean person disease cases may inapplicable available 
records fields missing information challenge get reliable rules involving 
attributes equally missing information 
case data sets small important take account sample discard records missing values 
need conduct research find rules involve missing values
