metadata languages currently developed allow people index web information resources knowledge representations logical statements subsequently store web documents 
languages built xml rdf oml choice xml underlying format ensures standard xml tools usable exchange parse metadata languages 
xml metadata languages built verbose difficult specialized editors point illustrated 
editors eliminate need people language representing knowledge application dependent editors simply allow predefined frames filled 
consequently noted authors ontobroker xml languages information written versions machines humans 
additionally standard xml tools little help managing languages specialized editors analyzers inference engines required 
reduce information redundancy ontobroker provides notation embedding attribute value pairs html hyperlink tag
