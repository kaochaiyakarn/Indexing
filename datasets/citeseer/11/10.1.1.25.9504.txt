bookmarking tools having noted bookmark maintenance top usability problems web pitkow research projects investigating new styles bookmarking interfaces example www dynamic bookmark takano winograd data mountain robertson 
study reveals users build large bookmark collections current interface schemes tend unwieldy producing extremely long menus forcing users re organise bookmark structure 
results showed approximately quarter bookmarks invalid 
results indicated users tend pages visited far pages 
empirical analysis web clear design implications 
firstly bookmark collection systems sufficiently scalable manage large collections 
data mountain instance shown effective collection pages may difficulty scaling larger data sets 
secondly bookmark collection systems include tools assist users managing collections particularly identifying invalid bookmarks 
thirdly systems support shortcut mechanisms personal toolbar folder efficiently navigating small set frequently visited pages
