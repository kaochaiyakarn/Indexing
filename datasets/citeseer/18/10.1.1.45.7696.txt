extension real players replacing automated agents avatars done variety ways 
constraints necessary maintain plausibility simulation gravity non interpenetration objects avatars may greater lesser degrees freedom 
players subject role induced constraints difficult enforce 
avatar granted freedom human player may able force incorrect behavior part virtual agents refusing comply rules game 
little freedom virtual experience uninteresting human participant 
automated players select alternative choices game variety strategies 
constrained interaction human controlling avatar may menu current choices asked select 
currently planner chooses set regions seeker explore selects promising 
real player choice regions manually indicate explore 
necessary behaviors strictly enforced 
alternately allow human complete freedom action movement making simulation truly immersive experience 
exception handling routines may utilized recognize handle improper behavior better design avoid situations place 
example avatar seeker screen go blank count goes way force seeker close eyes 
due novelty excitement virtual reality participants initially tend stand near motionless scenery 
incentive provided force player hide explore give chase agents 
disastrous player just wander environment provoke truly interesting behavior part automated players 
rich repertoire behaviors ascribed standard human virtual environment interaction 

system allows user encode different sets rules strategies intuitive structure pat nets step transforming rules encoded natural language executable code 
imposing limited defined semantics possible encode rules format strategy automatically generated set rules opposed current method user specifies rules associated behavior 
advent upcoming graphical interface pat nets construction tailored simulations easier especially repertoire encoded actions expanded 
pat nets lend readily control scheduling needed animation virtual simulations 
networks may high level synchronization interleaving action decision making 
various behaviors gaze locomotion controlled parallel independent networks 
augmenting system incorporate direct human participation require little alteration system added modules accommodate constraints input output 
reactive decisive nature automated agents allows easy expansion environment computer controlled agents treat human agent differently 
typical virtual environments populated agents solely reactive 
human participating virtual experiences considered focal character agents environment take cues 
human need fulfill role protagonist
