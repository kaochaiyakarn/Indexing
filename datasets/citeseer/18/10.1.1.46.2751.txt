general principles developed previous research structuring interacting data freeform systems data structured prematurely 
dummbo uses philosophy collecting data 
separate capture interface design interface delay interpretation captured data time visualize access 
address specific problems capture informal meetings mentioned 
minimal start cost informal spur moment meetings occur spontaneously 
barrier start tools capture meetings turning recording devices initializing programs sufficient prevent 
experience classroom scheduled activities classes users reluctant spend minutes setting classroom 
user system advance preparation just walk room 
spontaneous meetings users tolerant start time meetings typically quick encounters 
minute preparation time significant short meetings plus users away purpose meeting 
capture system ready record able explicit actions user 
problem minimizing start cost figuring start recording explicit user commands 
sense whiteboard recording continuously 
works streams information produce output activity 
example stream ink stream created pen 
audio stream fit approach encoding wav format compress silent recordings ambient background noise 
efficient record audio time challenge determine relevant audio occurring turn recording 
activities initiate recording session human presence near board sudden sustained increase audio levels obviously whiteboard activity marking erasing 
detecting audio levels approach environments inherently noisy lead falsely recorded meetings 
dummbo currently begins capture session detects gathering people board starts writing erasing whiteboard 
detect presence whiteboard ask users explicitly dock whiteboard java ibutton dallas semiconductor 
separate detail context toolkit infrastructure addition presence detection fairly straightforward dummbo 
context toolkit insulates dummbo application details infrastructure making equally easy experiment techniques presence detection 
act explicitly docking whiteboard violates goals transparent interaction see chose addition providing human presence provide identity easily reliably 
explicit act docking provides option attend meeting anonymously 
meeting inferred whiteboard activity minutes group 
transparent interaction goal dummbo computer invisible user 
people accustomed drawing writing whiteboards various colored markers erasing fingers eraser possibly items board tape magnets 
deviation standard tools interactions get way everyday activity brainstorming opportunistic discussion unnecessarily bringing foreground requirements underlying computation 
furthermore additional interaction required capture system ignored cost learning minimal capabilities readily apparent considered valuable 
approach dummbo limit available activities exactly match traditional whiteboard 
dummbo supports activities naturally occur whiteboard looks feels just real whiteboard user person familiar whiteboards 
special training awareness dummbo computers required 
problems dummbo 
problem improper interpretation erasing done finger noticed common 
smartboard operates contact closure surface way detect tool colored markers eraser finger leaves pen tray 
correct time finger tools tray 
frequently users erase finger holding pen 
smartboard incorrectly assigns activity pen system records finger movements ink 
better techniques needed determine tool commercial alternatives techniques

addressing access problems focussing design effort minimize start costs capture presents challenge access phase 
applications classroom defined session boundaries structure artifacts produced access 
explicit knowledge session boundaries aim support informal opportunistic meetings 
informal meetings occur set people time 
dummbo attractive users exactly challenging design perspective creating effective access 
effective access interfaces functionality entire system useful users go unused 
captured data stored database users issue explicit queries data want provide visual way search memory seeking 
objective access phase provide visualization techniques maximize user capability browse pin pointing captured activity significance 
determined effective way browse captured information information recall 
example rough time periods remembered talking jen yesterday late week lunch 
remember people gathering 
may remember discussion occurred 
summed remembering high level details meeting 
assumption time place colleagues designed interface access phase dummbo provide easy ways query database captured activity parameters 
inferring structure main idea access interface dummbo captured data user quickly easily infer structure 
interface shown provides representation whiteboard filters reduce amount information shown user similar dynamic queries 
filter picks location meetings occurred 
filter narrows month searched 
month activity recorded day day highlighted 
selecting day shows timeline dividing day hours 
recorded activity visualized daily timeline 
looking daily timeline user easily infer meetings occurred 
simple visualizations people various times assist related inquiries 
result style interface human infers structure meaning data visually filtering decorated timelines 
helps facilitate searching find specific meeting doesn help understanding details actual meeting 
supporting effective retrieval purpose access interface promote provide memory aid live experience 
part people want entire captured experience 
locate relevant part experience play back parts 
meeting user able effectively browse retrieve specific details 
dummbo supports ways browse 
way allows user play back meeting specified temporal location 
desirable playback see strokes advance light color animated true color written seen 
successful playback tricky whiteboard provides reusable surface ink written erased re written times location 
techniques detecting user erasing entire small part board segment dynamic single page board collection slides 
technique implemented creates new whiteboard page certain threshold ink erased 
remaining ink copied new page 
playing back meeting information current page shown advance 
pages shown thumbnail images 
style meeting browsing content whiteboard

user dragging timeline slider just playback slider audio video streams 
desired image obtained whiteboard user point ink whiteboard index audio 
portion whiteboard interest created long period time information reflected timeline 
artifact centric browsing reveal different epochs session ink interest focus attention 
examples browsing method occur regularly prolonged discussions diagrams
