image metasearch inquirus queries multiple image search engines web downloads actual images creates image thumbnails display user 
inquirus handles image search engines return direct links images engines return links html pages

metasearch engine searches web making requests multiple search engines altavista infoseek 
results individual search engines combined single result set 
advantages metasearch engines include consistent interface multiple engines improved coverage 
previously developed inquirus metasearch engine web 
inquirus number differences typical metasearch engines 
inquirus fundamentally downloading analyzing individual web pages referenced search engines opposed simply retrieving merging search engine responses 
means inquirus date working current contents pages allows extensive analysis done page contents 
page analysis functions performed inquirus include extracting query sensitive summaries relevance assessment easier user consistent relevance measure pages difficult typical metasearch engine filtering non relevant documents improved duplicate detection query term context query term highlighting quick jump links viewing pages query expansion occurring morphological variants clustering occurrence words phrases 
inquirus returns results progressively processed parallel architecture inquirus allows typically return result faster standard search engine respond

motivation principle motivations image metasearch functions inquirus similar motivations creation text metasearch engines poor precision limited coverage limited availability limited user interfaces image search engines 
expanding points poor precision 
automatically determining relevance images keyword queries difficult task various image search engines typically different means assessing relevance 
query difficult know image database produce best results 
limited coverage 
search engines index publicly available images web lycos index web exhaustively 
coverage web general coverage images limited 
different engines tend index different images coverage improved combining results multiple engines 
limited availability 
due search engine network difficulties observed engine responds quickest varies time 
limited user interfaces 
image search engines support different query syntax engines support phrases queries 
advantage metasearch techniques queries modified appropriately individual engines 
architecture shows simplified control flow diagram image metasearch algorithm

small thin images filtered images typically icons separators 
note engine displays images groups creating montage thumbnails 
image map display appropriate page individual thumbnails clicked 
montage technique browser implementations prone crash large number smaller thumbnail images 
notes architecture engine 
engine rely validity urls provided image search engines images downloaded processed filtering links longer valid 

engine presents thumbnails images 
low precision search engines helps users determine relevance image easily rapidly compared engines return url referencing image page containing image 

results returned progressively images downloaded analyzed images downloaded 

clicking thumbnail full image displayed window

images cached locally results substantial improvement browsing speed reduction frustration waiting images load

efficiency impression image metasearch technique may technique slow 
surprisingly fast 
results engine typically display seconds remaining images typically display faster user browses currently displayed images connection 
part perceived speed due parallel architecture engine 
shows median time engines respond queries simultaneously web search engines happens inquirus 
shows median time arbitrary web pages downloaded queries simultaneously pages 
median distribution response times significantly skewed shown shows histogram page retrieval times arbitrary web pages 
seen downloading pages parallel result pages retrieved significantly faster average page retrieval times helps explain image metasearch engine start displaying results quickly 
potential drawback image metasearch technique uses significant amount bandwidth 
note simply bandwidth increasing rapidly bandwidth issue may important 
certainly bandwidth requirements far brute force search web

links improve metasearch standard search engines making increasing links pages 
example google uses pagerank part method ranking pages 
pagerank considers numbers links pages pages linked highly linked pages get ranked higher 
inquirus know number links pages technique 
inquirus link information 
query return pages link desired page returning desired page 
pages may links contain better descriptions pages pages 
example researcher homepage contain name title page link page include researcher name link 
shown inquirus displays links page summaries easy see follow links 
inquirus analyzes graph created links pages result set order identify authoritative pages links pages links authorities hubs

users finding valuable documents 
average words query higher typically reported values web search engines 
queries phrases higher typically reported web search engines 
higher number words query increased phrases may due user population primarily scientists query suggestions inquirus
