rhythmic constraints stress timing english fred cummins robert port indiana university department linguistics cognitive science program bloomington suggested running title rhythmic constraints stress timing failure document isochronous intervals spoken english may attributed unconstrained nature experimental tasks 
experiments described probe degree relative durations intervals series repeated phrases independent 
experiments introduce novel paradigm speech cycling investigating temporal phenomena speech 
data reveal presence strong rhythmic constraints stress timing hitherto experimenters 
argued constraints evidence task specific dynamical system prominent events stress beats constrained occur specific predictable phases enclosing cycle 
dynamical system characterized entrainment metrical levels principle underlies rhythmic coordination activities locomotion 
numerous phoneticians suggested english speech tends exhibit roughly equal intervals jones pike 
instrumental search isochrony english carried class 
developed measured intervals onsets nuclear vowels stressed syllables 
strict isochrony observable rhythmic groups similar numbers syllables similar segmental content carefully matched grammatical structure 
subsequent studies isochrony hypothesis shen peterson dauer hill witten crystal house 
despite strong impressions listeners rhythmic basis speech 
concluded perception rhythmic regularity speech construct illusion probably known general tendency perceptual apparatus regularize face noise dauer specifically hear temporally patterned events structured 
comprehensive review listed reasons studies failed document isochrony 
speech material largely uncontrolled 
secondly researchers uniform framework isochrony identified 
example shen peterson regarded sentence having primary stress connor identified stress groups single limerick 
importantly clear deviation strict isochrony permissible required sentences perceived regular 
assessed degree deviation regularity form phrase final deceleration necessary perception regularity

second possibility received attention beats silent

result successive intervals related regarded regular intervals related perfectly isochronous series silent beat 
failing consider silent stress beats led researchers prematurely reject isochrony hypothesis 
silent beats admitted fold obvious speech rhythm may turn complex degenerate rhythm simple isochronous series 
fact believe points cause complete reinterpretation empirical far failed document isochrony english speech 
class original observations isochrony rare unconstrained speech influence continues felt largely factors ring true class 
produced situation investigators treated speech rhythm empirically supported phenomenon pointed perceptual regularity means entails regularity physical stimulus suggested speech rhythm simply unobservable
