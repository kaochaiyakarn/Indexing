faq minder system developed comprehensive approach analyzing text file structure hammond burke semi automated mode accurate tagging technique 
reserve labor intensive process files obscure irregular organization 
majority faq finder files tagged automatically regular expression perl program called faq 
regular faq files faq system achieves number question answer pairs hand tagging 
necessarily reflect accuracy automatic tagging spurious question patterns caused false positive false negative 
false positives occurred non question pattern file matched question pattern file pattern occurred frequently real question pattern file 
caused specific patterns 
example hp faq line tagged question que subject courses hp ux que line topic question file real questions listed level index number example subject

line matches pattern subject read start subject followed spaces followed digits periods followed spaces include arbitrary string newline characters 
faq files pattern matched question correctly
