newell simon reason symbols arbitrary problem inference stipulating special causal properties symbols just right shapes 
arbitrariness insures inference rules rely identities symbols magical properties hidden physical realization 
symbol structures composable 
central claim physical symbol system hypothesis combinatorial expressive power prerequisite general intelligent action 
recursively composable structures constitute representation language believe clancey meant term linguistic representation 
specialized information processing tasks require combinatorial representation language pssh tells language unavoidable generally intelligent agent 
analog numerical representations violate requirements physical symbol system 
lack capability arbitrary designation constrained maintain analogical relationship thing represent 
consider example homomorphism voltage levels thermostat temperature values room 
voltage level distinct analog pattern arbitrary 
relationships analog patterns voltage level denotes warmer room state voltage level defined explicitly symbol structures symbol manipulation rules 
predetermined causal structure thermostat sensor source analogy voltage temperature 
analog representations appear lack combinatorial power 
may speculate uses fractal structures chaotic attractors knowledge representation schemes evident achieve useful compositionality low dimensional analog numerical system

arbitrary designation certainly achievable issue compositionality explored touretzky smolensky pollack elman
