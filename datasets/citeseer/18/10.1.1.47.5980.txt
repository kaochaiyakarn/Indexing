people having space real world feel hampered software computer monitors diagonal 
higher resolutions combined larger screen sizes surely reduce feeling compromise

dynawall order provide large space project teams designed interactive wall called dynawall

wall segments covered special way create illusion large homogeneous working area 
software side displays coupled support effect 
rest wall passive elements speakers pen current hardware setup sophisticated sufficient express basic ideas workplace combines elements real world virtual digital world information 
challenges certainly lie software area especially design user interfaces new type device 
contributions human computer interaction sheer size dynawall opens new dimension human computer interaction 
users normally able perceive contents display 
user interface address issue 
secondly interacting wall means physical compared desktop computers respect arm movement head turning walking wall appear chi proceedings late breaking results 
user interface facilitate interaction wall minimize physical actions 
approach problem consistent gestures hand finger pen widgets gesture driven icons 
sections briefly describe interaction styles implemented dynawall shuffling throwing displayed objects 
shuffling mechanism shuffling displayed objects convenient quick way re arranging objects area medium size say twice span arm 
users shuffle objects display writing directed strokes special widgets handles 
software reacts input moving object length dimensions 
motion value pre defined shuffling operation 
example user wants move image pixels aside right simply write horizontal quick stroke left right top image handles 
consequence image moved window width right 
throwing moving objects larger distances achieved different set gestures 
users write short stroke opposite direction object moving followed longer stroke correct direction 
longer stroke compared second higher pace thrown object 
find throwing objects requires training efficient way pre defined motion value 
similar pick drop mechanism described introduced modeless way object display carrying location putting back display 
dynawall done laying user hand object handles waiting half second 
software shrink object disappears hand 
laying hand empty area wall lets object re appear grow hand original size spilled 
inbetween take put operation technically cut paste software temporary state possible take object previously taken put back 
early user feedback time written evaluation taken place 
dynawall new interaction techniques demonstrated institute open day 
visualized ideas means interactive presentation visitors provided positive response concerning importance huge display spaces dynawall proposed interaction styles 
visitors tried techniques enthusiastic 
early feedback encouraged continue working direction empirical evaluations follow 
implementation notes basis view system provided coast framework able combine physically separated displays electronic whiteboards logical space 
sample application dynawall provides similar functionality meeting room software dolphin gesture set extended fulfill requirements 
dolphin coast designed support cooperative persons simultaneously dynawall person group segment 
terms improvements versions important aspect covered ordinary system feedback terms dialog boxes warning messages standard mechanisms displaying boxes middle screen dynawall users front see content 
plan integrate sensors wall find users working place dialog boxes 
open question mechanism putting back objects multi user environment 
dynawall multiple persons objects happen time 
hope solve problem making sensor technology mentioned
