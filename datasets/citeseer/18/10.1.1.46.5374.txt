problem smart environments interaction myriad different devices particular selection devices controlled 
typically different devices require different control tools 
contrast generic point click appliance proposed 
interact device environment generic control appliance pointed devices selection providing visual feedback user obtains control information device allows control help simple user interface 
important issue smart environments interact wide diversity devices interesting little explored aspect select devices interaction 
typical approaches separate controls different devices separate remote controls tv video selection profiling user action selection context awareness technology 
alternative approach propose generic point click appliance 
call appliance aide appliance interacting devices environment point click system consists control appliance aide device ubicomp environments small extension devices environments 
suggest generic control appliance useful particular interaction devices possess user interface function controlled spatial distance visual proximity familiar
