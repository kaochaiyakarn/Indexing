complexity complex protocol 
sum total base specifications including asn pages 
sip hand call control extensions session description protocols totals merely pages 
defines hundreds elements sip headers base specification call control extensions small number values parameters contain information 
basic interoperable sip internet telephony implementation get headers call id cseq request types ack bye small assigned homework programming problem 
fully functional sip client agent graphical user interface implemented just man months 
uses binary representation messages asn packed encoding rules 
asn generally requires special code generators parse 
sip hand encodes messages text similar real time streaming protocol rtsp 
leads simple parsing generation particularly done powerful text processing languages perl 
textual encoding simplifies debugging allowing manual entry messages 
similarity allows code reuse existing parsers quickly modified sip usage 
complexity stems protocol components 
clean separation components services require interactions 
call forward example requires components 
different protocols complicates firewall traversal 
firewalls act application level proxies parsing entire message arrive required fields 
operation stateful messages involved call setup 
sip hand uses single request contains necessary information 
provides array options methods accomplishing single task 
example distinct ways may original approach separate connections tunneling 
original approach call signaling channel set control channel established media channels opened 
require round trips call setup

extensibility extensibility key metric measuring ip telephony signaling protocol 
telephony tremendously popular critical service internet telephony poised supplant existing circuit switched infrastructure developed support 
heavily service features provided evolve time new applications developed 
compatibility versions complex issue 
internet open distributed evolving entity expect extensions ip telephony protocols widespread uncoordinated 
critical build powerful extension mechanisms outset 
sip learned lessons smtp widely protocols evolved time built rich set extensibility compatibility functions 
default unknown headers values ignored 
require header clients indicate named feature sets server understand 
request arrives server checks list named features requires header 
supported server returns error code lists set features understand 
client determine problematic feature fall back simpler operation 
feature names hierarchical namespace new feature names registered iana 
means developer create new features sip simply register name 
compatibility maintained different versions 
enhance extensibility numerical error codes hierarchically organized 
basic classes identified hundreds digit response code 
basic protocol operation dictated solely class terminals need understand class response 
digits provide additional information usually useful critical 
allows additional features added defining semantics error codes class achieving compatibility 
textual encoding means header fields 
self evident meaning subject fields 
new header fields added various different implementations developers corporations determine usage just name add support field 
kind distributed documentation standardization common simple mail transfer protocol smtp evolved tremendously years 
sip similar mechanisms developed extensibility sip 
protocol extensions protocol pep contains pointers documentation various features messages 
provides extensibility mechanisms 
generally fields placed various locations asn 
params contain vendor code followed opaque value meaning vendor 
allow different vendors develop extensions 
limitations 
extensions limited places non standard parameter added 
vendor wishes add new value existing parameter placeholder nonstandard element added 
secondly mechanisms allowing terminals exchange information extensions supports 
values non standard parameters self describing limits interoperability terminals different manufacturers 
addition requires full backwards compatibility version 
various features come go size encodings increase 
sip allows older headers features gradually disappear longer needed keeping protocol encoding clean concise 
critical issue extensibility audio video codecs 
hundreds codecs developed proprietary 
sip uses session description protocol sdp convey codecs supported endpoint session 
codecs identified string names registered person group iana 
means sip codec implementations determine name codec contact information iana 
codec centrally registered standardized 
currently itu developed codecs 
carry significant intellectual property free sub kb codec system 
presents significant barrier entry small players universities 
furthermore sip allows new services defined powerful third party call control mechanisms 
mechanisms allow third party instruct entity create destroy calls entities 
controlled party executes instructions status messages passed back controller 
allows controller take actions local program execution 
model traditional telephony 
hundreds telephony services currently defined unreasonable attempt write specifications 
sip allows services deployed basing simple standardized mechanisms 
mechanisms construct variety services including blind transfer operator assisted transfer party calling bridged calling dial bridging multi unicast multicast transitions ad hoc bridge invitation transition various forwarding variations 
example extension service creation mechanisms pstn internet internetworking pint working group ietf defining simple sip extension click type services 
scenario user web page clicks button pstn entity connects user telephone customer service rep requires control protocol web server pstn enabled device 
sip protocol 
provide basic mechanisms line 
facility message allows callee direct caller contact different party basically blind transfer 
allows mc change media encodings conference various participants 
fairly limited scope executed mc call 
provide generic third party control mechanisms needed building complex services 
aspect extensibility modularity 
internet telephony requires large number different functions include basic signaling conference control quality service directory access service discovery certain mechanisms accomplishing functions evolve time especially regards qos 
critical functions seperate modular orthogonal components swapped time 
critical seperate general protocols functions 
allows function duplicated applications ease 
example efficient single qos mechanism application independent invent new qos protocol mechanism application 
sip reasonably modular 
encompasses basic call signaling user location registration 
advanced signaling part sip single extension 
quality service directory accesses service discovery session content description conference control orthogonal reside separate protocols 
example possible capability description elements sip changes sip 
modular 
defines vertically integrated protocol suite single application 
mix services provided components encompass capability exchange conference control maintenance operations basic signaling quality service registration service discovery 
furthermore intertwined various sub protocols 
sip modularity allows conjunction 
user sip locate user advantage rich multi hop search facilities 
user located redirect response url indicating actual communication take place 
iv 
scalability find sip differ terms scalability 
observe scalability number different levels large numbers domains originally conceived single lan 
issues wide area addressing user location concern 
newest version defines concept zone defines procedures user location zones email names 
large numbers domains complex location operations scalability problems 
provides easy way perform loop detection complex multi domain searches done storing messages scalable 
sip uses loop detection algorithm similar bgp performed stateless manner 
server processing system telephony gateways required handle calls multitude users 
similarly sip servers gateways need handle calls 
large backbone ip telephony providers number calls handled large server significant 
sip transaction servers gateways stateful stateless 
stateless model server receives call request performs operation forwards request completely forgets 
sip messages contain sufficient state allow response forwarded correctly 
furthermore sip carried tcp udp 
case udp connection state required 
means large backbone servers udp operate stateless fashion reducing memory requirements improving scalability 
hand requires call loop stateful 
keep call state entire duration call 
furthermore connections tcp means gatekeeper hold tcp connections entire duration call 
pose serious scalability problems large 
furthermore gateway gatekeeper need process signaling messages call 
simpler signaling faster processed calls gateway gatekeeper support 
sip simpler process sip allow calls second handled particular box 
conference sizes supports multiparty conferences multicast data distribution 
requires central control point called mc processing signaling smallest conferences 
presents difficulties 
firstly user providing mc functionality leave conference exit application entire conference terminates 
addition mc gatekeeper functionality optional support party conferences cases 
note mc bottleneck larger conferences 
alleviate latest version defined concept cascaded mc allowing limited application layer multicast distribution tree control messaging 
improves scaling somewhat larger conferences protocol defines additional procedures 
means distinct mechanisms exist support conferences different sizes 
sip scales different conference sizes 
requirement central mc conference coordination fully distributed 
improves scalability complexity 
furthermore udp tcp sip supports native multicast signaling allowing single authors aware study measuring processing overhead sip 
feature sip blind transfer operator assisted transfer hold sdp multicast conferences multi unicast conferences bridged conferences forward call park directed call pickup table sip call control feature comparison protocol scale sessions millions members 
feedback defines procedures allow receivers control media encodings transmission rates error recovery 
kind feedback sense point point scenarios ceases functional multipoint conferencing 
sip relies rtcp providing feedback reception quality obtaining group membership lists 
rtcp sip operates fully distributed fashion 
feedback provides automatically scales person point point conference huge broadcast style conferences millions participants 
services sip offer roughly equivalent services 
call control services listed table 
seen chart sip support similar services 
comparison dimensions somewhat difficult new services added sip 
expect table different printing 
addition call control services sip sdp provide capabilities exchange services 
regard provides richer set functionality 
terminals express ability perform various encodings parameters codec codecs 
implementations don require implement basic indication supported sip choose subset encodings list media streams sufficient equivalent current capabilities implemented 
sip provides rich support personal mobility services 
caller contacts callee callee redirect caller number different locations 
locations arbitrary url contains additional information terminal location 
information language spoken business home mobile phone fixed list callee priorities conveyed location 
allows caller flexibility choosing location talk 
non interactive terminals original call setup convey caller preferences nature terminal contacted 
allows network proxies forward call preferences 
sip supports multi hop searches user 
call request particular address sip server contacted address 
sip server may machine callee currently residing server proxy request additional servers 
servers turn may proxy request party contacted 
server proxy request multiple servers parallel 
allows search user operate rapidly 
sip allows multiple branches search accept call passing responses back caller 
caller decide party speak 
allow call doe com picked doe wife answering machine 
caller hang answering machine continue party call desire 
support kind mobility limited 
facility message redirect caller try addresses class response codes sip 
express preferences caller express preferences original call invitation 
wasn engineered wide area operation support forwarding call requests servers mechanisms loop detection 
doesn allow gatekeeper proxy request multiple servers 
supports various conference control services including chair selection mike passing conference participant determination 
sip provide conference control relying protocols service 
simple forms conference control sending notes obtaining conference participant listing available rtcp
