preliminaries effective different complex application programs strongly hindered required knowledge operational modes user technical background information system application domain interaction mechanisms 
currently casual user system generally discouraged working amount technical knowledge required running program generally needs long learning time line tutor 
number interfaces different techniques better exploit human senses suggested implemented enlarging bandwith man machine communication channel 
example create interfaces natural language form textual dialogue speech interpretation synthesis 
availability graphical devices low cost rise years large diffusion interfaces visual techniques 
known advantages images text come particularly relevant man machine interaction 
advantage visual approach attracts user attention stimulates full coverage available system facilities 
currently possibility visual elements forms diagrams icons simply drawings increasing context general purpose programming languages 
expression visual programming refers system allows user program bi multi dimensional modality 
visual programming includes visual languages subclass visual query languages dealing particular kind objects data databases 
systems including languages environments called visual query systems vqs 
database field promising application areas visual languages database queried casual user may conversant query programming languages sql 
visual tool may help access database dependency native language limitations imposed application area 
factors influence effective vqs extensively discussed 
significant factors point view user models adopted describe data query operations performed may adopt entity relationship model data model select traversal operations query model representation chosen display model instance may decide represent object employee icon rectangle containing textual label time may represent select operator clicking mouse touching screen interaction strategies system order formulate proper query 
concentrate interaction strategies defining suitable taxonomy analyzing presently available vqs compared taxonomy 
vqs proposed referred order motivate chosen classification criteria 
detailed survey vqs see 
vqs proposed far provide user different modalities interacting database distinguish shot stepwise modalities 
adopted systems working simple application domains immediate conceive final expression simple query terms available information shown screen schema contained display 
general applications hand query synthesis may need different steps 
stepwise modality tries simplify approach focusing different steps required expressing query understanding 
goal phase precise definition fragment schema involved query 
generally schema richer subset concepts needed query find result step corresponds identification concepts useful query 
result phase query subschema 
query formulation 
query subschema static representation concepts involved query 
concepts manipulated ways available query operators 
goal query formulation formally express operands involved query related operators 
testing 
goal testing verify query expression precisely matches user intention 
systems allow iterate different steps combine modalities query 
section strategies provided steps open problems deferred section 
strategies understanding reality interest interaction strategies facilitating user understanding database domain may classified main groups topdown browsing schema simplification shown table 
subdivision group included systems belonging different classes 
table strategies understanding vqs understanding reality interest may complex task schema hundreds thousands concepts needed mechanism schema varying amounts detail controllable users 
may achieved means top approach general aspects reality perceived specific details introduced specific details provided existing systems different means 
selective zoom 
case schema unique concepts layered terms importance levels schema graphically examined levels abstraction objects specified importance rank visible 
user graphically edit schema irrelevant objects removed screen 
see example session guide schema represents current population survey contains comprehensive data individuals families households 
entity person focus concept concepts highest detail level level represented appearing schema distance radius person 
shows schema detail level set radius 
iterative refinements 
case system provides schema library top refinements 
refinement obtained previous means primitive transformations applied atomic objects resulting detailed structures 
top browsing may selecting specific objects complete schemas navigating different levels schema order better locate desired concepts 
example strategy appears 

hierarchical zoom 
case schema unique objects may examined different levels detail 
example hierarchical zoom escher 
case data model directly reflects structure objects extended nested relational model basic types attribute values defined multi sets lists tuples atomic values arbitrary depth nesting 
starting flat tables classical relational database systems escher allows aggregation objects contextual relation 
visual interface allows user display nested tables levels detail 
selective zoom guide 
dialogue approach 
understanding process user system dialogue 
system uses universal relation approach main problem query disambiguation translation incomplete query completely specified 
corresponds selection portion database attributes relevant user query 
reason strategy proposed consists sequence user decisions relevance attribute respect query interpretation attribute considered relevant included target list 
established technique learning information content schema browsing 
browsing essentially viewing technique aimed gaining knowledge database principle handle schemas instances homogeneous way distinction 
main hypothesis user minor knowledge database interaction techniques furthermore accesses system having predefined goal 
hypothesis user starts interaction examining concept neighbourhood adjacent concepts considered level explanation examined concept new element selected user neighbour concepts current neighbourhood shown process proceeds iteratively 
incremental enhancement user knowledge obtained exploring logically adjacent concepts 
browsing may specialized cases 
intensional browsing 
performed intension database conceptual schema 
approach followed example qbd corresponds schema structure asking existing paths connecting concepts specifying conditions length path presence particular concepts asking concepts possess properties group concepts selecting neighbour concepts 

extensional browsing 
performed extension database 
different approaches may pointed example consists showing occurrences database vertices graph edges represent existing links occurrences 
represent existing links occurrences 
adopted example starts intensional schema database selects object browses instances 
possible multiple occurring attributes may independently scrolled object 
instances objects linked relationship may simultaneously scrolled order show consistent information 
particular kind browsing provided lid living database 
fact user lives inside single entityrelationship tuple sees database perspective tuple 
starting session user selects entity chooses list entity tuples tuple wants reside called current tuple system shows relationships tuple participates related entities 
tuple linked entity selected new current display changes new perspective 

mixed browsing 
case browsing activity may performed intensional extensional part database 
example kiwi user interface models internal model interaction model display model represent information allows overcome possible drawbacks browsing paradigms inefficiency short sighted navigation 
particular interaction model partitions object neighbourhood homogeneous subsets defining suitable structures ease presentation interaction object descriptions 
browsing may performed iconic systems 
example mediabench iconic system natural image icons may dynamically change shape characteristics 
mediabench considers types browsing overview content structure browser 
overview browser offers user general idea database providing categorization object icons different windows dimension 
content browser helps user grasp content objects previously selected overview browser see 
goal browser access visualize object contents allow fast user understanding 
structure browser displays relationships database objects 
mixed browsing mediabench alternative approach top refinement browsing schema simplification 
idea bring schema close query done building user view results aggregations transformations concepts original schema 
top approach possible locate concepts exactly match initial schema different levels abstraction schema simplification approach user may build proper view schema principle isomorphic detail level original schema 
approach followed qbd target model exactly matches initial data model 
approaches 
target model different initial model order produce better query representation 

strategies query formulation successive phase process extracting information database expression query 
table provides comparison query systems strategies query formulation 
table strategies query formulation vqs top strategy query defined firstly specifying concepts interest intensional level subsequently restricting set instances expressing conditions properties 
different approaches may literature 
global navigation followed local inspection 
approach user navigates database order select concepts involved query specifies query procedural characteristics 
example oql query expressed browsing diagram object classes selecting intensional pattern interest classes associations 
point extensional patterns selected extensional patterns possible instantiations intensional pattern depending concrete instance values 

intension followed extension 
approach user specifies objects involved query subsequently selects required instances 
example approach shown taken 
starting point set nested relations represented tree 
user initially chooses starting trees tree student tree 
pruning operations performed trees example applying projection operation 
example attributes name addresses selected system computes new instance shows resulting tree screen 
user entered name new relation result name represented screen instance see contains answer user query 
second strategy query formulation called bottom 
case query formulated splitting problem elementary subproblems obtaining final query composition partial results 
query paradigms may grouped common definition difference method followed tackling elementary subproblems composing partial results 
different approaches outlined sequel fig query formulation 
composition concepts 
approach followed iconic languages output concepts query produced composing input concepts way queries specified overlapping icons 
operation selecting icon overlapping icon interpreted particular chain operations database 
shows query formulation 
query show weight hi fi vcrs price equal cheaper select lightest 
vcr icon front panel typical selected icon area moved retrieval area point icon set operation vcrs shown see 
icon representing price selected overlapped vcr icon condition price specified setting range values see 
hi fi icon appears icon set operation restriction hi fi vcrs performed overlapping mechanism 
icon showing schematized scale representing weight superimposed weights displayed lightest selected 

query libraries 
case queries composed subqueries stored system library 
example subqueries represented terms parametric skeleton furthermore possible store result query execution expressed turn called named query 
overlapping icons query strategy called inside outside characteristic concentrating concept group concepts moving order reach concepts interest 
may classify strategies type underlying graph may followed 
connected hierarchical graph 
case user focuses attention concept system builds hierarchical view database selected concept root 
example query formulation 
query display names students took course cs 
course selected root concept choice root determines direction involved relationships sections course attendant students section 
relationship attributes assigned entity lower level hierarchy 
user provides conditions entity selected 
conditions attributes root entity specified involving related entities 
simple conditions supplied displayed screen order form complex conditions 
hierarchical query formulation user chooses attributes displayed root entity remaining entities 
worth noting different root entities may specified query shown 
connected flower shape graph 
querying modality location particular concept called main concept entity relationship seen entry point subqueries subqueries express possible navigations main concept concepts schema 
subqueries combined means usual union intersection operators 

unconnected graph 
previous examples neighbour concepts may reached starting central concept paths explicitly represented schema 
contrary user may interested reaching concepts building new relationships 
approach typical relational systems called outer join operator 
user starts selecting entity name list 
system draws screen empty table entity set specifying attribute names 
user builds query step step deleting non relevant attributes writing conditions select entities 
outer join operator expressed entity relationship model 
example qbd query primitive available allows joining entities explicitly linked schema 
join performed comparing attributes entities suitable window 
strategy query formulation called mixed represents compromise top bottom strategies 
main approaches 
example 
alternative approach traditional querying procedure user formulates question system retrieves answer user may provide example answer system identifies goal generalizing example 
known application approach qbe 
querying environment user specifies set tables tuples example requested answer system starting example identifies query responds filling tables tuples match example 
query paradigm followed system idea integrating browsing functionalities generalization mechanism capturing abstractions needed constructing queries examples 
example approach may result suitable querying database containing image data 
example user asks system retrieve paintings drawing rough sketch 
system evaluates similarity sketch images database retrieves matching paintings 

pattern matching 
approach user provides pattern system looks fragments database matching pattern 
pattern expressed means labelled query graph see top label regular expression match edge labels simple paths graph representing database 
label ca na specifies request routes airline network subpaths turn set canadian airlines ca flights followed national airlines na flight 

strategies testing purpose testing verify query corresponds user intention 
testing strategies may subdivided main categories idea rephrasing query known language presenting new version user validation consists visualizing animation computation performed query 
target language query rephrasing approach restricted natural language standard query language sql 
example complex query conditions specified system condition natural language names entity sets attributes relationships cardinalities declared schema 
example sql query reformulation 
formal mapping defined entityrelationship schemas corresponding relational schemas query expressed terms entity relationship model possible generate corresponding sql expression relational model 
pattern matching query visualization may concern structure query result 
example case query formulation tree structure constructed root object initially chosen 
new choice user tree dynamically updated 
picasso visual feedback provided representing system interpretation query 
result query new relation displayed window splitted subwindows 
top subwindow displays available commands lower subwindow message window delivering simple information user 
third window browsing query result 

final remarks open problems seen visualization may play crucial role facilitating man machine interaction accessing databases 
specifically visual approach may effective solving query problems large databases may happen application areas example legal information systems geographical information systems 
systems database grows size rapidly problem user find contained database 
generally done formulating queries observing results reformulating queries iterative process hopefully satisfy user request case time consuming 
example solution problem suggested coupling data visualization visual reasoning 
idea transform data objects sample data objects visual space order contents database visible user 
furthermore iconic operators applied regions visual space process reasoning inference making carried aim reformulate user query order obtain expected result process called visual reasoning visually clues 
combining data visualization visual query visual examples visual clues possible come better ways formulating modifying user query preventing user getting lost vast amount data 
important aspects designing vqs relates system usability mainly determines user satisfaction 
generally existing query systems limited capability addressing wide classes users 
overcome limitation system able create user profile formally describes user interests skills 
profile dynamically maintained system analysis interaction story including queries user reactions system messages 
specifically user profiles extremely significant cases query highly subjective 
instance system allows accessing paintings artistic impression left user 
impressions may differ users system able analyze learn correlations subjective descriptions paintings correlations form user profile 
aspect related user profile availability personal visual interface portable database constant spatial arrangement tools desk accessories menus querying command types general analysis problem see tentative solution direction 
related user satisfaction availability guided learning phase generally required user may acquire confidence proficiency new environment 
phase iconic representations functions operations querying mechanism stored data may great value achieve aim tools may available guided tours learning example help facilities independent user technical background 
general note appropriate metrics defined evaluate user satisfaction surprisingly system mentions concrete experience application relationship users 
standard parameters introduced quantize system usability different systems compared 
proposals solutions problems may come cognitive engineering discipline trying understand formalize human machine interaction 
limitations visual query systems inherited traditional systems 
lack mechanisms inferring implicit knowledge stored facts possibility automatically infer grandfather father father 
order overcome limitation notion deductive database introduced studied decade 
deductive databases significant limitations describe facts closed precise positive 
order face problems logic knowledge bases introduced representing facts open indefinite complete positive negative 
extensions require higher expressive power query language 
important aspect usually logicbased knowledge bases open semantics fact considered false negation formally derived consequence query interpretation changes don know answers may obtained 
limitation existing systems concerns deterministic approach followed query interpretation unique meaning assigned query system 
limitation addressed area approximate questioning queries allowed specify exactly desired result 
number research projects active natural language query formulation disambiguation restricted domains 
visual languages may provide new handles tackle overcome described bottlenecks section lists number significant approaches area 
example hyperbook user retrieve bird drawing silhouette bird imitation mentioned descriptions incomplete difficult user give exact specification 
hyperbook solves queries basis data model called metric spatial object data represents objects real world points metric space 
order select candidate objects distances evaluated system enabling user choose objects birds minimal distance query metric space
