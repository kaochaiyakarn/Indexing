design principles brief overview section clear metrics differ significantly 
giving point point comparison think beneficial attempt draw principles metrics desirable general 
divide principles general categories meaning metric results sensitivity metric entity misbehavior practical effectiveness metric 
principle illustrate desirable demonstrating metrics fall short consequences authentication decisions 
principles propose obvious fact new spirit 
notably maurer proposes high level desiderata models public key infrastructures section 
list principles shares certain ideals maurer strive specific principles 
addition knowledge principles demonstrations proposed metrics fall short respect new 
principles may obvious demonstrate metrics comply believe obvious ones bear repeating 
meaning basic desideratum metric output meaningful 
clearly metrics consider argue achieve better 
primary factors determines degree metric meaningful precision model 
principle important consideration believe constructing model 
principle creating model metric applied require user infer bindings keys owners 
particular representing certificates model entities don sign certificates keys 
motivation principle establishing name key bindings arguably difficult error prone process need metrics 
metric falls short principle maurer 
repeat previous section edge exists maurer model user evaluating metric holds certificate public key allegedly issued signed entity definition 
maurer uses word allegedly verification exists evidence certificate issued claimed entity 
put way entity allegedly signed certificate claimed certificate claim best hint worst opportunity misled 
presumably reason systems certificate includes claim entity signed claim key signed 
example pgp certificate indicates identifier public key verify signature certificate chapter 
cases certificate represented maurer model ambiguous presumably user infer certificate signer certificates key verifies certificate signature 
interpretation allows certificate represented multiple edges different certificates indicate different owners verification key 
similar concern arises beth model model nodes entities 
evaluating metric requires user collect values entities various direct recommendation edges 
user safely assign value edge user authenticate value having come assuming authentication performed cryptographically certificate user asked determine key authenticate order form model query wants answered 
second motivation principle modeling certificate signed entity hides key sign certificate 
result ambiguities representing certificates multiple certificates signed different private keys owned entity 
principle meaning model parameters unambiguous 
especially applies meaning probabilities trust values models 
expect ambiguous semantics model parameters generally lead different metric values depending interpretation parameters 
discrepancies interpretations resolved output metric meaningful especially entity relies numbers entity different interpretation 
issue arises maurer metric example policy dictates confidence parameters assigned certificates recommendations left unspecified 
raises concerns 
maurer interpretation confidence parameters probabilities sufficiently justified 
suggested means determining confidence parameters speaker identification telephone line assigned confidence parameter bear relationship random experiments 
second user evaluating metric presumably adopt confidence parameters certificates recommendations determined creators ambiguities semantics parameters compounded misinterpretation user 
beth klein complete regard prescribing detailed formula entity compute label edges trust relationships numbers positive negative experiences entity trust relationship 
pgp leaves specification trust designations outside model provides little guidance determining trust designations treated confidential data propagated user 
principle metric take account information possible relevant authentication decision user trying 
principle subject caveats see section 
principle desired metric produces output limited information generally greater effort required interpret authentication 
demonstrated example reiter stubblebine metric 
described section reiter stubblebine model consists solely graph nodes represent keys edges represents certificates available user evaluating metric 
contrast metrics reiter stubblebine metric effort take account trust relationships recommendations entities entities appear model named labels attached edges metric consider 
metric returns set disjoint connective paths user left determine paths trusts labels various edges paths 
worse metric take account trust information may inhibit user decision adopt recommended name key binding including returned paths nodes edges user unfamiliar expense user preferred 
pgp somewhat better regard 
model allow user specify keys trusts certification hand provides help user making decision way account recommendations 
means user determines trust certification outside model 
maurer klein metrics provide way accommodate recommendations entities

sensitivity section discuss sensitivity metrics misbehavior entities
