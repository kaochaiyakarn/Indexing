model object represents piece furniture maintains geometric transformations visual attributes relevant object 
model objects organized hierarchically possible select interact groups furniture 
interactive representation model user interface called view 
views created specific interpretation model information 
interpretation determined type view type model data context interface 
example consider furniture model interior design application views graphics rendering furniture browser items model 
rendering creates geometric primitives appropriate type furniture geometric transformation attributes directly customize presentation 
hand browser creates list labels taken model objects ignores geometric information 
views presentation parameters bound model interpretation local customization interface 
interpretation straightforward non geometric model information
