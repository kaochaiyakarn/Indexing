traditional face face english auctions rely auctioneer fairly interact bidders accept highest bid behalf seller 
line auctions require fair negotiation 
face face auctions line auctions inherently subject attacks bidders auctioneer 
attacks include selectively blocking bids bidder amount selectively closing auction particular bid received 
line english auction bids processed fairly auction closes fairly specialized trusted parties 
particular need trust auctioneer obtain fair outcome auction 
number line auctions rapidly growing 
fact forecasts indicate line auctions barter generally replace conventional purchase set price items 
currently nearly line auction houses 
limitation existing auctions bidders trust auctioneer concerning fair outcome 
detection auctioneer may selectively block bids bidder amount 
bidders trust auctioneer doesn selectively close auction particular bid received 
english auction ends effectively timeout interval highest bid 
line auctions approximate property setting expiration time allowing auction continue expiration time long higher bids continue submitted short timeout interval 
fixed expiration time allow continued bidding current line auctions trust auctioneer fair enforcing closing time 
existing auction designs provide assurance repudiation bids assurance fairly closing bidding 
author primarily performed research 
auctions sealed bid may appropriate applications 
importantly involve trusted auctioneers 
assurance auctioneers increased employing threshold methods high percentage compromised trusted auctioneers necessary violate assumed trust 
noted approach applicable auction run large organization 
simplistic terms reasonable expect say employees servers server administrators government organization xyz honest 
different assume servers deployed relatively small xyz little collude 
useful assurance necessary trust auctions conducted small auction houses better remove trust entirely 
auction design provides fair close auction bid refusal auctioneer provable bidders 
time need bidders trust auctioneer vice versa 
trusted elements employed ones currently available development independent public information infrastructure 
include public key authorities public certified delivery services

similar notion time lock puzzles 
basic idea commit secret uncovered predictable amount time 
example secret encrypted key recoverable inherently sequential computation fixed length 
receiving message able decrypt fixed amount computation 
message readable computation performed 
committing receipt message committing ability read message performing computation 
removes contingency auctioneer commitment bid 
necessary reveal commitment secret 
possible avoid performing computation bid committed 
desired secret key revealed providing shortcut access message 
imagine features auction shortcuts revealed 
client software reveals bid proper conditions met 
number sticks motivate bidders 
deposit collected returned lottery client reveals shortcuts 
auctioneer cheat keep deposit expense image bidding community 
alternatively bidders financial incentive entered lottery provided coupons offers 
reason default design uses sbc despite incentives automation shortcuts revealed bids denial service attack auctioneer performance possible 
properties fair english auctions design line auction 
current line auctions strong trust assumptions auctioneers 
auction design uses specialized trusted parties uses trusted parties exist independently information infrastructure 
trusted parties minimized periodic updates insure fair closing conditions certified delivery service ordinary communication fails auctioneer perform properly 
auctioneer performing properly receiving certified deliveries 
fact variants auctioneer operate properly 
despite minimal independent trusted parties able give informal arguments design meets properties set
