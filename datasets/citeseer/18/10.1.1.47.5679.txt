article begins formalizing certain information retrieval fundamentals 
particular aboutness relation document descriptor introduced

preferential semantics implied path discussed 
information related properties preferential structures highlighted 
particular sound inference rules allow possibility reason user preferences information 
information retrieval fundamentals information retrieval process decides information carrier document information carrier query description 
previous sentence suggests article distinguish types information carrier documents query descriptors 
descriptors represent user information need form query means characterize document facilitate retrieval 
documents assumed drawn finite set documents 
descriptors hand drawn language primitive elements referred keywords 
definition descriptor language set keywords language lk defined smallest superset lk lk phi lk outer brackets phi ignored reasons simplicity 
operator phi denotes information composition 
allows complex descriptors constructed primitive ones 
examples information composition readily information retrieval 
consider boolean retrieval query shuttle design illustrates conjunction compose individual keywords 
resulting expression represents need informed design space shuttle 
information composition typically enjoy useful properties commutativity associativity :10.1.1.48.4688
example system phi information system information versus information phi system information system 
properties phi depend descriptor language chosen rules govern composition 
special keyword empty keyword denoted ffl property describes documents 
information composition behaves expected ffl phi phi ffl information carriers meaningfully composed 
reason incompatible information share clashes contradictory

information preclusion arises naturally information retrieval 
example searching documents river phi pollution documents air phi pollution probably interesting 
river phi pollution air phi pollution emphasizes preclusion relationship product information need type preclusion investigated detail 
documents indexed indexing function facilitate retrieval 
specifically indexing yields characterization lk documents triple hd ki referred retrieval model framework user queries issued 
traditional information retrieval system match descriptors descriptors characterization 
overlap sufficient document deemed returned

information retrieval systems process relevance feedback means user preference information 
process user identifies documents parts documents find relevant positive relevance feedback
