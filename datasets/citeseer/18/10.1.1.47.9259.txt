chapter bryan loyall thesis loyall offers detailed analysis requirements believability 
classical vs behavioral ai thinking meet illusion life believability requirement explore distinction classical behavioral ai 
order distinction clear discussion describes extreme classical behavioral positions 
certainly ai incorporates aspects approaches 
classical ai behavioral ai narrow deep broad shallow generality fits environment disembodied embodied situated semantic symbols state dispersed uninterpreted sense plan act reactive classical ai concerns building mind complete agents 
research program consists isolating various capabilities mind reasoning memory language building theories systems implement capability isolation 
believed disembodied pieces mind put form complete person integration deferred 
behavioral ai seeks build complete agents minds pieces minds operate complex environments 
concern environment key distinguishing characteristics classical behavioral ai 
classical ai attempts build mental components duplicate capabilities high level human reasoning simplified environments behavioral ai attempts build systems savvy insects small mammals complex environments 
behavioral systems broad range shallow sensory decision action capabilities single narrow deeply modeled capability 
classical ai seeks general solutions theory language understanding theory planning behavioral ai starts assumption complex fit agent environment may generic solutions environments just animals don function removed environment 
classical ai mental capabilities body interface mind body commonly addressed 
behavioral ai assumes having body embedded concrete situation essential intelligence 
behavioral people don buy cartesian split 
body defines interaction patterns agent environment 
ai historical affinity symbolic logic classic ai systems utilize semantic symbols pieces composable syntax objects relationships world 
state world mind operates represented constellation symbols 
behavioral ai concern environmental coupling complex symbolic representations building representations environment keeping date notoriously difficult frame symbol grounding problems 
researchers brooks cog maintain extreme position symbolic representations systems employ state get nasty arguments precisely constitutes symbol 
classical ai agents tend operate sense plan act cycle 
sensing symbolic representation state world updated making inferences sense information 
agent constructs plan accomplish current goal symbolically represented world composing set operators primitive operations agent perform 
plan executed 
plan completes interrupted unplanned contingency cycle repeats 
employing sense plan act cycle behavioral systems reactive 
composed bundles behaviors describes simple action sequence actions 
behavior appropriate environmental internal conditions 
conditions constantly change complex pattern behavioral activation occurs resulting agent action 
order build characters illusion life need broad capabilities interact complex environments 
lead oz develop research philosophy technology strong affinities behavioral ai 
insect capability continuously act complex changing environment immediately useful building lifelike characters brain vat classical ai

research goals believable agents vs ai behavioral classical ai share high level research goals odds research believable agents 
believable agents ai personality competence audience perception objective measurement specificity generality characters realism believable agents personality king 
character may smart dumb adapted environment poorly adapted 
regardless smart character dealing environment personal style

classical ai meant competence complex reasoning problem solving

technology comes classical behavioral ai outside ai entirely fair game exploration oz context long opens new expressive artistic spaces 
authoring desire pursue specific general strongly connected desire support direct artistic creation characters 
traditional media writing painting animation artists exhibit fine control creations 
starting idea vision head artist uses fine control create representation vision chosen medium 
similarly oz wants support level artistic control creation believable agents 
approach provides interesting contrast traditional ai alife 
ai alife hap language developed oz project laid spectrum explicitness 
clearer shortly 
traditional ai lies high explicitness spectrum 
systems tend explicitly encode human readable form high level features system 
example suppose wanted build james bond traditional ai mindset 
think characters 
general theory captures notion character 
general theory parameterized knowledge select specific characters 
inform look dimensions personality described various personality models psychology thinking feeling intuitive sensing judging perceiving 
generic architecture built define different characters setting right personality knobs 
position just described bit exaggeration dissimilar approach taken virtual theater project stanford 
example master servant describe explicit personality dimensions describe characters 
look character mind find symbol denoting character intuitive alife lies low explicitness spectrum 
major methodological assumption alife want high level features emerge simple low level mechanisms 
go building james bond 
saying alife technology stage emerge high level behavior 
build dog 
inform look models developed biologists ethological models animal behavior 
build general architecture capturing ethological theory action selection animals decide action take 
dog specific behavior general architecture 
approach dissimilar bruce blumberg approach media lab building dog group current directly focused building characters building biologically motivated systems 
hap language developed oz project writing believable agents lies midpoint spectrum 
hap provides mechanisms support writing behaviors characters 
behavior chunk activity behaviors high level behavior having fun low level behavior moving character body open door 
wanted build james bond hap identify high level goals motivations james bond think multiple ways behaviors james bond accomplish high level goals 
multiple behaviors probably subgoals 
behavior appropriate certain conditions happened bond feeling happening right world conditions captured behavior 
level description james character 
bond thinks bond walks artist control create character consistent vision 
traditional ai alife approaches architectural commitments general architecture characters fit 
traditional ai approach tries capture high level mental regularities types personalities 
problem personality knobs needed tune large number characters 
personality knobs need turned degrees freedom knob need order allow creation bugs bunny hamlet terminator 
differences characters far outweigh similarities 
put way bugs captured symbols read inside mind way smeared mind body 
alife approach avoids high level knobs define personality 
depends low level mechanisms cause high level behavior emerge 
pragmatically want build human characters alife approach understood emerge high level behavior 
just matter time 
hap approach behavior authoring useful gap building characters today re impatient don want wait alife developed support characters 
oz perspective problem alife dependence emergence 
notion emergence tell kind high level behavior emerge low level mechanisms running system 
oz wants build systems give artists control express artistic visions 
emergent system removes control artist best principled guesses mechanism see kind behavior emerges

oz believable agents designed part specific story world 
interactions character intended intense bounded duration context story world 
notion repeated interaction long term characters certainly appealing

artificial life approaches building animal characters rely modeling biologically plausible processes 
example creatures creatures utilize neural net action selection model bio chemistry modeling motivations drives artificial genome crossover mutation reproduction artificial immune system 
blumberg uses action selection mechanism motivated ethology 
intuition utilizing models biological systems exhibit complicated behavior 
structurally similar computational processes may enable equally complex behavior artificial systems

virtual humanoid differs oz believable agent concern generality realism
