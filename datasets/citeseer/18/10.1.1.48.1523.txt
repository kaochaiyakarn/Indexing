isaac tasks problem reformulation creative reverse engineering base constructive analogy carried mechanism known function driven morphological synthesis moor man ram 
mechanism builds researchers goal increase creative potential individuals 
attribute listing proposed crawford cited finke ward smith begins reasoner considering object thinks springboard new creative artifact 
object primary attributes examined reasoner thinking ways manipulated 
reasoner filters manipulations lead remain considered creative 
morphological synthesis proposed allen cited finke ward smith begins fashion attribute listing 
reasoner considers attributes commonly accepted values 
new combinations attributes values examined 
reasoner looks unknown combinations may prove creative 
similar attribute listing morphological synthesis reasoner concentrate changing attributes time explores interesting combinations 
leads faster generation potentially creative artifacts 
obvious drawback approaches reasoner develop novel concepts just relatively close variations original concept novel concepts 
due fact reasoner considers primary attributes modification 
main advantage morphological synthesis capability attribute combinations decreases time needed produce potentially creative artifacts technique allows new attributes 
function directed morphological synthesis discussed ram starts concept needs understood goal solution critique 
reasoner applies set manipulator functions artifact altering attributes producing new artifacts possess original functionality achieve functionality novel ways 
modifications performed ways examining known concepts functionality see achieve functionality search reasoner knowledge attribute possible values 
intelligent robot example achieve intelligence manner humans knowledge humans allow reasoner postulate robotic brain added concept industrial robot resulting new concept describing intelligent robot 
modification reformulates original problem discovering brain designed implemented integrated industrial artifact 
representation constraints creativity techniques creative concept manipulation powerful effectively alter artifact attributes produce new artifacts producing conceptual change 
problem concept manipulation difficult specify principled constraints process
