stemming common form language processing information retrieval systems 
similar morphological processing natural language processing somewhat different aims 
information retrieval system stemming reduce different word forms common roots improve ability system match query document vocabulary 
variety word forms comes inflectional derivational morphology stemmers usually designed handle systems stemming consists solely handling simple plurals 
stemmers group conflate words synonyms children childhood variant word forms typical function 
stemming studied mainly english evidence useful number languages 
stemming english usually done document indexing removing word endings suffixes tables common endings heuristics appropriate remove 
best known stemmers experimental ir systems porter stemmer iteratively removes endings word termination conditions met

despite problems recall precision evaluations porter stemmer show gives consistent small performance benefits range collections better stemmers 
krovetz developed new approach stemming machine readable dictionaries defined rules inflectional derivational morphology 
stemmer called kstem addresses problems porter stemmer produce consistently better recall precision performance 
reasons kstem heavily dependent entries dictionary conservative conflation

generally view stemming constructing equivalence classes words 
example porter stemmer conflates bonds bonding bonded bond words form equivalence class 
corpus statistics word pairs equivalence classes determine final classes 
example bonding bonded occur significantly particular corpus may removed equivalence conflation class depending relationship words 
specifically stemmed occurrences stemming transformation form equivalence class 
stemmed stemmed form equivalence class 
porter stemmer occasionally incomplete 
consider bug porter stemmer put equivalence class 
suppose collection vocabulary fw algorithm construct equivalence classes follows 
word porter stemmer stem fr 
element form singleton class 

pair equivalence class merge equivalence classes 

equivalence class remove elements union find algorithm runs log linear time log small number large 
final equivalence classes representative stem class generated 
chose simply shortest word class

issue word pairs insufficient statistics

advantages query stemming user system consulted applicability particular word forms queries restricted search specific word form 
advantages significant cases small differences word forms result large differences relevance retrieved documents 
example looking articles terrorist incidents word assassination discriminating relevant non relevant documents word useful 
main disadvantage query stemming queries longer take longer process
