problem query formulation imagine journalist writing article effects economical crisis asia 
part journalist task illustrate article photos hopefully attract readers increase sales magazine news 
study journalists reported clear feature articles journalists freedom normal news items 
example function photo may evoke associations 
time find photo 
journalist usually considers concept single illustration task 
economical crisis example possible concept crowded stock market 
illustration idea photo demonstrating normal people money left spend example showing empty shopping street crowded hong kong 
cases photo expressing despair panic probably preferred photos explicit emotions 
furthermore constraints page layout may ect choices performing illustration task 
assume journalist access video archive news bulletins originating various 
archive time date source maintained news bulletin 
video data modelled sequence key frames text version audio track 
content key frames indexed color texture features 
comparison news archive storing similar metadata described 
searching stock market subtitles may succesful initial query 
precision results probably high meaning key frames matching subtitles really show stock market scenes 
recall may low scenes stock markets may labelled explicit annotation mentioning stock market 
note problem worse second illustration idea hong kong shopping street text query 
emotional aspects images searched especially hard capture textual query 
searching despair subtitles probably retrieve useful results 
aspects illustration task may captured easily terms feature representations images 
journalist possibly expected express high level concept despair combination color texture features 
conversely internal representation video meta data completely invisible users
