criticism large itemset method large itemset method proved useful tool mining association rules large datasets inherently sparse 
cases method difficult generalize scenarios computational reasons 
criticisms associated large itemset method ffl itemset generation shall explain issue help example 
consider retailer breakfast cereal surveys students activities engage morning 
data shows students play basketball eat cereal students play basketball eat cereal 
minimum support minimum confidence find association rule play basketball eat cereal association rule misleading percentage students eating cereal larger 
playing basketball eating negatively associated involved decreases chances involved 
consider association play basketball eat cereal rule lower support lower confidence rule implying positive association far accurate 
set support confidence sufficiently low contradictory rules generated hand set parameters sufficiently high inaccurate rule generated 
words combination support confidence generate purely correct association 
example illustrated table items coefficient correlation 
positively related negatively related 
support rules illustrated table 
interestingly support confidence rule strictly dominates support confidence rule possible find level minsupport rule generated spurious rule generated 
set minsupport low cases especially different items widely varying global density unacceptably large number rules generated great majority may spurious defeats purpose data mining place 
ffl dealing dense data sets dimensional database possibilities itemsets 
data sets may large number possibilities may qualify minimum support 
situations may necessary set minsupport unacceptably high level 
may result number important rules lost 
value minsupport decided computational constraints restricting number rules generated manageable number 
impossible ascertain important rules lost 
important applications data may dense negative association rules suppose wish find negative correlations items 
words wish mine association rules presence absence item may 
large itemset approach directly extended problem treating absence item pseudo item sparsity item presence real transaction data may result considerable bias rules concerned finding rules corresponding absence items presence 
data different attributes widely varying densities suppose categorical data corresponding customer profile information available sales transaction data wish find association rules concerning demographic nature people buying different items 
case directly applying itemset method may difficult different densities demographic sales transaction information

hand bit representing item may take value time 
alternative approach collective strength interest measure solution order avoid spurious association rules

notion developing implication rules association rules discussed 
implication strength rule number 
implication strength indicates strength rule exactly assumption statistical independence 
implication strength larger indicates greater expected presence 
measure preferable confidence deals greater expected measures finding association rules 
different notion called collective strength defined 
desired find interesting association rules greater expected values 
collective strength itemset defined number 
value indicates perfect negative correlation value indicates perfectly positive correlation 
value indicates breakeven point corresponding itemset expected value 
itemset said violation transaction items transaction 
concept violation denotes times customer may buy items itemset may buy rest items 
violation rate itemset denoted fraction violations itemset transactions 
collective strength itemset denoted defined follows gamma gamma delta expected value calculated assuming statistical independence 
pause understand meaning collective strength proceeding 
note violation itemset transaction bad event perspective trying establish high correlation corresponding items 
fraction bad events gamma fraction events 
definition collective strength recast follows events events delta bad events bad events interesting properties collective strength 
notion collective strength treats attributes symmetric way 
apply problem absence presence item find itemsets immediately perceive benefits definition 
instructive examine definition collective strength fares case itemset fi items perfectly positively correlated collective strength corresponding itemset 
case fraction occurances bad events 
hand items perfectly negatively correlated fraction events collective strength corresponding itemset pair 
items independent collective strength 
provide example light criticisms expounded interest measure section 
collective strength uses relative number times itemset database 
itemsets insignificant presence pruned stage 
level presence itemset constitutes useful information exactly problem finding items related 
support order isolate itemsets substantial presence database 
strongly collective itemset high collective strength subsets 
definition itemset denoted strongly collective level satisfies properties collective strength itemset 
closure property collective strength subset necessary force closure property order ensure unrelated items may itemset
