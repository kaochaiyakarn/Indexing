lifestreams 
think diary electronic life document create stored documents people send 
technically time ordered stream documents 
tail stream contains documents past starting electronic birth certificate 
moving away tail stream contains documents papers progress latest electronic mail received documents pictures correspondence bills movies voice mail possibly software stored 
moving stream contains documents need reminders meeting schedule todo lists 
users interact lifestreams operations new clone transfer find summary 
new clone create documents 
new creates unique document adds stream 
clone takes existing document creates duplicate added stream 
transfer copies document stream stream 
find prompts user search query email haven responded faxes sent schwartz creates substream 
substreams virtual directories gifford manber wu user view document collection 
case view contains documents relevant search query 
substreams differ conventional directory systems placing documents fixed rigid directory structures create virtual organizations documents stream 
documents aren stored substream substream temporary collection documents exist stream 
collection documents substreams may overlap 
substreams created destroyed fly affecting organization provided stream substreams 
substreams dynamic 
allow substream persist collect new documents match search criteria added stream 
example substream created query find documents created people subsume mailbox automatically collect mail arrives 
similarly substream created electronic mail haven responded act special mailbox contains unanswered mail 
operation summary takes substream compresses overview document 
content overview document dependent type documents substream 
instance substream contains daily closing prices stocks mutual funds investment portfolio overview document may contain chart displaying historical performance securities net worth 
hand substream contains list tasks need complete overview document display prioritized list 
time ordering 
substreams organize documents bother underlying time ordering reasons stream adds historical context document collections documents eventually read past set stone history order method created 
diary electronic lives streams document correspondence transactions 
historical context crucial organizational setting cook notably current software systems little track documents created deleted taken granted world 
portion stream acts workspace holding working documents typically new documents created incoming documents placed 
newly created documents hang time read pushed past automatically archived process 
portion stream allows documents created world computers defy space time 
allowing creation gives natural method posting reminders scheduling information

current research lifestreams running actively developed 
user feedback driving development new summarize capabilities personal agents 
tackling problem enabling agents lifestreams general identify relevant documents automatically 
loosely separate research subgoals learning user profiles past interactions context identifying documents match profile meet expected current need 
say problem 
discuss current lifestreams relation second making clear assumptions 
words indexing lifestreams model assumes documents deleted 
moved archival storage hidden view level remain accessible 
lifestreams implementation provide efficient context sensitive searching capabilities users find looking 
finding documents need semi structured file systems similar searching packed hall closet lit garage urgently needed object 
know looking don know find 
asked possible index document easily months years needed possibly quite different context 
think answer necessary sufficient condition documents richly indexed possible 
example text documents lifestreams indexed word modulo standard list 
assume better just faster indexing algorithm leave indices unweighted time creation 
particular index flagged important retrieval context difficult impossible anticipate 
believe creating complex structured indices unnecessary long server supports retrieval arbitrary combinations simple indices efficiently 
responsibility retrieval software find right combination possibly iterative process successive approximation 
refining search relevant documents designed lifestreams particular philosophical bent documents indexed unweighted keys retrieval happens context context exploited weigh terms indices dynamically 
extends model proposed fertig gelernter fertig gelernter support automatic calculation retrieval cue 
concept feature long history ai going back expert system internist miller authors internist manually assigned weights features lifestreams server empirically temporarily assign weights 
statistics calculated documents stored server particular query context perform feature weighting weights refine search 

suppose start boolean search predicate find adaptive parall mpp piranha mpp yields substream documents
