motivation understanding hierarchical relationships policies determine required satisfaction policies 
high level policy defined changed possible decide lower level policies created changed 
ultimate aim able specify high level policies automatically generate lower level ones similar automatically generating code requirements specifications difficult achieve 
motivation analysis see set lower level policies fulfil higher level policy providing complete cover target objects meeting policy goals

issues relating refinement analysis policy hierarchies discussed 
discussions policy hierarchies 
policy analysis general multiple policies apply object 
example obligation policy specify activity manager corresponding authorisation policy permitting manager perform activity 
set policies may cause problems omissions incorrect policy specifications 
conflict policies may result manager unable perform activities 
managers may attempt perform activities permitted may sufficiently intelligent avoid conflicts case human managers 
managers need tools analyse set policies stored policy service detect conditions may result problems management system 
coverage involves checking derived lower level policies cover objects specified higher level policy 
simplest case occurs target set partitioned creating multiple policies corresponding activity original applying subdomain original target domain 
comparatively easy check member policy driven management original policy target set member target set derived higher level policies 
determining authorisation policy applies object managed practical 
coverage analysis subset general problem completeness analysis notoriously difficult achieve 
ii missing obligation authorisation obligation authorisation policies considered independent theory obligation authorisation policy manager perform activity 
existence obligation corresponding authorisation activity prevents obligation performed 
may valid authorisation policies exist corresponding obligation 
example back manager may authorisation policies permitting various actions corresponding obligation policies created primary manager fails 
iii conflicts conflict may occur policies policy prevents activities policy performed policies interfere way may result managed objects put unwanted states 
activity policy specify set actions may conflicts actions single policy 
model management policies represents subjects target objects sets objects 
conflict may occur policies overlap subject target object sets 
overlap relationship sets objects exists intersection non empty 
obvious conflicts occur positive negative authorisation obligation policy subjects targets actions 
practical forbid overlaps useful situations 
set managers may perform different management activities disjoint target domains resulting subject overlap 
target overlaps occur managers full responsibility particular target domain limited rights perform activities query state perform diagnostics service provided objects target domain 
cases fact conflict may occur mean occur 
policy conflicts discussed detail 
problems detecting conflicts extremely difficult

analysis policy objects knowledge application activities may detect positive negative conflicts modalities conflicts obligation authorisation policies may possible automate 
conflicts require application dependent knowledge activities specified policies detect potential conflict 
require human intervention
