psi inheritance relations conceptual data modelling techniques offer concepts expressing subtype relations 
subtype relations capture inheritance properties 
literature types inheritance relations exist terminology far standard 
section important types inheritance relations considered specialization generalization 
conceptual data modelling techniques contain relations probably different name 
concepts specialization generalization correspond large extent specialization generalization defined ifo ah 
specialization specialization specific facts recorded specific instances object type 
specialized object type inherits properties supertype may additional properties 
specialization corresponds notion subtyping niam 
name name person course course salary dept department student employee teaching assistant example subtype hierarchy ifo example specialization consider ifo schema adapted ah 
schema boxes represent concrete types diamonds represent types circles represent subtypes 
double arrows denote specialization relations 
diagram student subtype person object type teaching assistant subtype student employee subtype hierarchy created express certain types certain facts recorded employees salary relevant 
remarked properties inherited downward employees name persons 
set theoretic terms general formalisation subtype relation treat injective function 
general requiring pop pop case subtype instances may different representation object types particularly object oriented data models 
category theoretically subtype relation correspond monomorphism recall category set monomorphism corresponds injective function 
sufficient adequate formalisation specialization relations 
consider example partial population schema pop person phi jones richards psi pop student phi st psi pop employee phi em psi pop teaching assistant phi ta psi subtype relations see ta em ta st em jones st richards sample population instance category set instance ta object type teaching assistant corresponds instances person richards jones

student employee person spec spec spec spec ffl em ta ffl ffl st ffl ffl richards teaching assistant jones non commuting diagram avoid problems subtype diagrams diagrams consisting solely subtype edges required commute 
terms subtype diagram imply function composition identical function composition ta ta 
inheritance category theoretically solved fact arrow composition defined 
generalization generalization mechanism allows creation new object types uniting existing object types 
contrary name suggests generalization inverse specialization 
specialization generalization originate different axioms set theory hw 
population generalized object type union populations participating object types referred specifiers 
typically properties propagated upward generalization hierarchy downward see ah 
implies identification generalized object type depends identification specifiers 
formula argument variable name example generalization psm example generalization consider 
schema graphical conventions psm hw dashed lines represent generalization relations 
psm schema models construction simple formulas formula may variable constructed function simpler formulas 
example demonstrates generalization specification recursive types 
generalization useful identical properties relevant different existing types properties related generalization types 
application coproducts yields possible categorical formalisation generalization 
generalized object type mapped coproduct instance category generalization arrows correspond canonical injections 
course coproduct represents disjoint sum set formalisation implies specifiers disjoint 
data modelling techniques necessarily true 
general formalisation generalized object types capable dealing non disjoint specifiers 
formalisation requires familiarity complex notions category theory colimits 
pointed result definition subtype diagrams commuting requirement imposed diagrams applies generalization 
collection types collection type object type instances correspond nonempty sets object type referred element type 
sets identical contain elements instances collection type identified elements need external identifications 
collection types correspond grouping ifo association ecr egh grouping classes sdm hm power types psm

schema object type convoy collection type element type ship 
ships identified code code identified constituent ships 
alternatives categorical formalisation collection types 
alternative exponents 
set theoretically solution correspond representation subsets means characteristic function 
approach serious disadvantages 
firstly exponent complex category theoretic notion easily understood 
secondly seriously exponents exist interesting categories 
exponents imply extra restrictive requirement class instance categories fund 
alternative sketches order allow general specification algebraic types bw 
unfortunately turns solution imposes restrictions fund 
approach adopted suffer problems outlined previous paragraph alternative treatment collection types hw 
pointed collection types superfluous new type constraint uniqueness constraint new identification scheme

uniqueness constraint schema expresses may associated role set ships 
constraint captures extensionality property sets 
object type convoy may identified role object type ship 
ship convoy contains participation eu translation convoy problem illustrate uniqueness constraint consider schema 
sample population schema violates uniqueness constraint related role correspond set phi psi eu population violating uniqueness constraint solution categorical formalisation uniqueness constraint follows observation constraint violated non trivial permutation set instances exists application population involved relationship type yields population
