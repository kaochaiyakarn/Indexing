see overview sundial system 
maximum usefulness dialogue management needs generic dialogue manager module able interpret generate utterances language task domain 
second problem dialogue management provide cooperative interaction user 
achieve system needs produce utterances perceived user natural coherent helpful context dialogue 
purpose modality dialogue forms part context case task driven spoken dialogues 
system needs deal inconsistent task information obtained speech recognizer parser yield plausible incorrect interpretation example user said want fly system understands london 
distributed solution sundial solution problems lies part distributed architecture dialogue manager 
dialogue manager responsible providing cooperative interaction user 
user point view system utterances appropriate helpful user current dialogue context 
achieve interpretation user utterances planning system utterances informed past current states interaction 
operative dialogue management requires construction maintenance interactional model model specifies layers structure distinguished dialogues 
grosz sidner distinguish linguistic structure attentional belief structure intentional structure 
intentional structure differentiated dialogue structure task structure 
unitary model layers single structured representation adopted distributed model layers distributed number modules 
module consists partial model interaction rules updating model associated dialogue management functions 
furthermore modules may need collaborate order determine update model update rules may depend information maintained module 
interactional model falsification definite agents assume infer belief model corresponds agent 
places obligation agents explicit state belief model give agent opportunity correct modify 
example system utters want go london response user request user opportunity contest current state system belief model 
sundial dialogue manager consists modules 
linguistic interface module interfaces dialogue manager parser responsible maintaining linguistic model system user utterances 
dialogue module responsible maintaining model dialogue context building interpretation user utterances determining dialogue continue 
dialogue structure framework dialogue hierarchically structured exchanges interventions dialogue acts 
order determine appropriate contextual interpretation user utterances dialogue module interacts belief module maintains model belief containing just concepts created directly result user utterances inferential extensions 
example system initiated exchange determine departure date flight exchange closed belief model interpret user utterance referencing date concept 
belief module requires context information dialogue module order guide interpretation process 
example second date flight concepts second may second flight depending context 
belief module additionally cooperates message planning module order provide semantic descriptions concepts referenced plan system utterances 
task module responsible maintaining model task structure dialogue consulting domain specific application databases informing dialogue module current state task 
typically involves deciding sufficient task information provided user additional parameters required 
frequent interactions arise user provides sufficient incorrect information example flight stated destination city 
simply informing dialogue module task satisfied task module attempts relax task parameters suggest alternative values 
example flights available morning departure day flights afternoon may suggested 
cases system utterances selected formulated explicit user fact alternative offered 
implementation sundial dialogue manager implemented quintus prolog tested variety different hardware platforms 
integrated rest sundial system successfully manages range english french german spoken public network telephone dialogues relating flight enquiries flight reservations train enquiries 
language task changed dialogue manager simply resetting switches govern choice static knowledge bases consulted dialogue management 
current average response times entire sundial system including speech recognition synthesis seconds dialogue manager seconds 
significant amount optimization carried expected response times approach real time months 
lexicon currently contains entries language 
problems facing dialogue management telephone information systems operative interaction portability languages task domains addressed dialogue manager sundial system 
solution distribute interactional model functions dealing operative interaction number semi independent modules 
module expert local part interactional model 
language spoken interaction application task changed instructing relevant modules consult different knowledge bases
