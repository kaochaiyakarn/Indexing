illustrate applying categorical treatment birkhoff arithmetic posets bir generalization metrics truth valued metric posets 
arithmetic provides nice abstraction sort concurrency operations advocating pra true concurrency partially ordered time approach algebraic birkhoff defines operations posets addition multiplication exponentiation cardinal ordinal version way unifying cardinal ordinal arithmetic 
concurrency connection cardinal vs ordinal corresponds parallel vs sequential 
cardinal operations conveniently described universals poset ordinals quite conveniently categorically categorically ordinal addition just indicating move parallel sequential usefully accompanied move categories categories
