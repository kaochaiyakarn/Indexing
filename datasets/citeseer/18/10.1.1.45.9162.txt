simplify problem slightly pilot study generally ignored issues degraded text coming speech recordings written newswire sources human transcribed stories broadcast news 
resulting tdt corpus includes news stories spanning july june 
half stories randomly chosen reuters news articles period half transcripts cnn broadcast news shows period 
stories assigned ordering represents order appeared news 
average story contains unique single word features stemming removing stopwords 
corpus includes relevance judgments set events

exhaustive judgments corpus contrast common pooled strategies unfortunate side effect requiring exhaustive judgments cost creating limits size corpus

ldc currently creating second larger tdt corpus tdt includes broader range sources times number stories larger number judged events audio stream closed captioning broadcast sources 
evaluation measures information retrieval systems generally evaluated basis ranked recall precision numerous measures proposed information filtering systems evaluated wider range measures including set measures various utility measures particular measure settled preferred tdt setting chosen measure system effectiveness primarily false negative false alarm false positive fallout rates 
major reason choosing perception problem detection task ranking task system needs indicate story new event tracked provide ranked list stories discuss event 
unfortunately fairly straightforward systems generate ranked lists stories provide score creates ranking difficult determine score threshold 
ideal system output score corresponds probability story discusses event ideal systems exist 
threshold issue detection error tradeoff curve show false alarm rates vary respect various threshold values

curves plotted errors exhibit normal distribution result straight line 
perfect system zero misses zero false alarms curve origin curves closer origin generally better may applications require performance particular false alarm rates 
applications left hand side det curve low false alarm rate probably interesting 
event tracking task false alarm rate means stories event incorrectly tracked
