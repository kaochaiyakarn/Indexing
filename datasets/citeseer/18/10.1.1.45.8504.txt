integration modules interesting problem discuss brief description em hap integration behavioral features section :10.1.1.45.3214
models emotion emotion system modeled scaled version cognition emotion model ortony collins clore occ influenced ideas dyer 
summarize scaled version occ model describe em model emotional system specific tok agent implemented lyotard cat 
explain diverged occ model changes useful necessary 
occ emotion model attempting describe possible emotion occ model works level emotional clusters called emotion types emotions cluster share similar causes 
example distress type describes emotions caused events 
distress includes individual emotions sad differ significant dimensions intensity reason event unpleasant 
discuss emotion types emotions keep mind really discussing clusters similar emotions 
occ model proposes emotions results types subjective appraisal events respect agent goals appraisal approval actions agent agent respect set standards behavior appraisal liking objects respect attitudes agent 
model proposes set emotions caused combinations emotions 
altogether give rise number emotions examine joy distress hope fear pride shame admiration reproach anger gratitude gratification 
events things happen including actions agents 
judged pleasing agent goals 
goals represent agent wants may actively pursued want eat may passive want win world series 
event eating dinner goal eat judged pleasing 
events give rise joy distress emotions intensity number factors including dis pleasing event 
prospect events gives rise fear hope 
joy distress intensity emotions determined potential event 
agents actions approved set standards 
standards represent moral beliefs right wrong thou shall hit people head personal beliefs level performance able bowl 
agent doing judging approves actions experience pride shame 
similar actions agent give rise admiration reproach 
intensities emotions primarily level dis approval action 
objects including agents liked disliked agent attitudes 
attitudes represent personal tastes preferences dislike modern art 
agent attends object thinks imagines notices give rise emotional response 
attending liked object gives rise love attending disliked object gives rise hate 
distinction keep clear attitudes emotions generate especially identical names feel love emotion people love attitude 
intensities emotions primarily level dis object 
emotions may combinations emotions 
example alice hits bob head bob action reproach find distress 
combination lead bob feel anger alice addition emotions 
addition intensity anger intensities component emotions tend overwhelm emotions effect 
similarly gratitude combination joy admiration gratification combination joy pride combination distress shame 
em emotion model em system occ model differs number ways useful necessary implement model develop tok emotion joy distress hope fear pride shame admiration reproach love hate gratification gratitude anger denotes difference occ model cause goal success goal failure prospect goal success prospect goal failure action self approved standards action self standards action approved standards action standards attention liked object attention disliked object action self causes joy pride action causes joy admiration action self causes distress shame action causes distress reproach table current emotions em causes agent lyotard cat 
detailed account lyotard structure behavior see :10.1.1.47.9057
table shows emotions em models em takes causes emotions causes differ described occ model 
section describe em implements emotions implementation decisions led away occ model 
way hap represents goals trivial em determine goal succeeded failed determining cause success failure necessarily possible 
possible agent goal succeed fail due event sensed inferred agent 
cases want agent react emotional manner 
reasons em occ model judge events directly 
em judges outcomes agent goals 
mechanism closer nature conflict theories emotion described mandler 
sets goals tok hap keeps goal tree current active goals em keeps list permanent passive goals 
types goals succeed fail various ways types goals importance level associated 
goal succeeds fails em creates joy distress emotion intensity equal importance goal 
passive goals checked em initial processing sense think act cycle 
internal state may change subsequent checks external world alter sense think act cycle 
means internal goal failures may immediately noticed general works fairly 
active goals hap responsibility hap discovers goal success failure alerts em gives em access goal determining goal importance cause success failure 
em directly assess cause goal success failure created mechanism help task 
em associates goal function examines agent sensory memory event may led goal success failure 
example lyotard pet goal succeeds em searches possible actions pet rub lyotard object credits event causing joy 
model agent perceived likelihood goal success failure emotions changes goal likelihood modeled 
tok system imagining potential events 
plan add internal world simulator tok help solve problem help goal likelihood problem 
generating hope fear somewhat complicated 
lyotard associate goal tests examine environment various cues indicate potential goal success failure 
tests able return cause fear hope em uses define emotion accurately 
lyotard get human open door goal hope test looks nearby humans open door lyotard 
human noticed test notes specific human agent responsible hope information determine intensity hope liked human creates hope neutral disliked human 
em checks active passive goals hope fear initial processing 
hap creates new goals alerts em em checks new goals potential hope fear 
em judges dis approval actions evaluating act senses standards 
lyotard house cat complete tok agent keep things simple modeling standards help goals succeed cause goals fail 
reason able speed process checking standards goals succeed fail possible standards general 
lyotard standards include test goal possibly assign credit blame 
example help goals succeed standard invoked success eat goal test look nearby human may just filled food 
em generate admiration nearby human 
objects dis liked agent attitudes 
attitudes contain function determining certain object matches attitude level dislike object 
em run set sensed physical objects specified agent builder attitude functions 
example lyotard checks objects senses attitudes 
say list objects attended 
crude attentional mechanism determining objects agent currently thinking noticing 
mechanism unrealistic reasons agents able attend sensed objects agents emotional reactions objects currently sensing remembered imagined objects 
list objects attended determined em matches attitudes 
match appropriate love hate emotion generated 
object lyotard responds emotionally human agent 
initially lyotard dislikes human 
lyotard contains rules updating attitude human doing things cause lyotard angry leading greater dislike grateful leading greater 
em updates attitudes initial processing stage sense think act cycle access sensed objects point 
change allow emotional reactions non sensed objects 
combination emotions created simply searching current emotions looking appropriate matches 
example distress shame emotions caused unintentionally hurting feelings emotion generated intensity intensity equal sum distress shame emotions 
lyotard search really necessary 
lyotard standards tied goals time emotion generated combination emotion generated 
complicated agents search mechanism necessary 
addition generating emotions em number emotion related responsibilities 
example em keeps track thresholds emotion type 
means agents built level emotional tolerance world spark emotional reaction series little events able generate emotional response 
em manages emotion decay 
time tok performs sense think act cycle em lowers intensity individual emotions 
distinction attitudes emotions generate important attitudes may change time tend stable emotions generate 
thresholds decay rates specifiable emotion type em customizable dimensions 
relationship em occ em system currently implement entire occ model em doesn model entire subset occ model 
limitation em model number emotion types happy satisfaction fears confirmed relief disappointment 
limitation due time constraints limitations tok lack models internal state agents 
emotions em model limited ways 
occ model contains list features influence intensity emotion types 
suggestions exhaust lists 
example intensity joy emotions supposed function joy causing event 
limitation number reasons time current state rest tok architecture features quite difficult quantify properly occ model suggestions approach 
second differentiate emotions type 
explained emotion types similar emotions differ number ways differences may relevance behavior 
example distress emotion may give rise specific behavior types distress 
occ model hints possible emotions type exist 
decide possibly agent agent basis ones useful differentiate 
include writing inference rules recognizing specific emotions writing appropriate behaviors express emotions 
em implement occ model ways extension em implemented version theoretical model includes number differences described necessary create working system em handles social knowledge interacts emotions section current plan implemented extend concept attitudes occ model especially important representing attitudes trust respect agents agents em part larger agent architecture create flexible way specify emotions influence behavior 
integration behavioral features em develops emotional state state influence agent behavior 
behavioral features components mental state modulate activity hap 
em contains set agent dependent rules setting features current emotional state agent 
example behavioral feature aggressive arise agent certain personality type experiences emotions fear anger 
aggressive feature result fear exist agent personality trait 
hap generate behavior consistent current features 
details done see :10.1.1.47.9057:10.1.1.45.3214
mechanism gives power represent large number personality types 
example fear emotion may lead number features fearful aggressive withdrawn excited depending personality trying model 
rules may give flexibility represent cultural differences agents 
example call emotion occurs goal fails distress carry direct significance behavior 
may want agents act withdrawn just easily model culture goal failures seen learning experiences cause agent act happily 
looking carbonell personality traits hovy rhetorical features additional ideas area 
social knowledge addition generating emotions features modifying behavior emotions em responsible aspect broad agents social knowledge relationships 
element social knowledge em responsible representing societal restraints action 
example agent gets tired expect agent sleep 
agent happens party time just lying considered unacceptable behavior 
aspect social knowledge built hap behaviors agent 
facet social knowledge em models interpersonal relationships agents relationships change time interact emotion 
interpersonal relationships complicated model keeping broad approach agents limited initial efforts simple relationships 
interpersonal relationships intertwined attitudes em uses determining emotions objects 
case objects just happen agents 
fact lyotard relationship human simple able attitude structures completely represent 
certainly necessary desirable agents 
lyotard relationships differ dislike dimension relationships varying strengths likes neutral mild dislike 
plan expand attitude system represent relationships involve elements trust fear admiration 
adjust emotion generation rules em reflect emotions may arise attitudes dislike 
case aspects relationships intimacy closeness relative social standing need structure offered attitudes 
relationships attitudes closely related social relationship directly influences emotional system 
example lyotard friend likes feel love enemy dislikes lyotard feels hate agent attitude feels neutral lyotard emotional experience 
emotions likewise affect social relationships 
emotions common cause changes relationships 
agent making lyotard angry liked lyotard agent making lyotard grateful liked 
lyotard initially dislikes user actions feeding eventually win 
cultural independence flexibility em assumptions emotional systems modeled agent explicit goals varying levels importance agent standards agent personal tastes attitudes goals standards attitudes conjunction appropriate events objects world lead emotional experiences agent recognizes interpersonal relationships 
assumption places restrictions architecture build types emotional systems model 
example trouble modeling system emotions arose randomly 
fortunately assumptions appear consistent lutz view cultural universals human emotional experience 
lutz cultural studied non western cultures better understand emotional experiences 
believes universals arise human social settings give rise emotional experience 
list cultural universals similar em basic assumptions contain goals standards social relationships 
proposed universals conflicting goals multiple actors violations cultural standards ego violation cultural standards anticipation danger physical psychosocial ego significant loss significant relationships threat loss receipt resources including tangible food intangible praise 
fact em assumptions consistent theory culturally universal causes emotion gives hope model overly restrict kinds emotional frameworks imitate 
just system assumptions inherently rule modeling human emotional systems mean system power represent systems 
fact believe system flexible model large number different emotional agents 
agent goals standards attitudes completely specifiable 
specifying agent goals specify agent needs wants desires including culturally 
specifying importance goals model agent priorities 
specifying agent standards specify agent moral code obviously culturally dependent 
specifying agent attitudes model culturally biased tastes preferences 
modeling attitudes little subtle need able specify attitudes agent plan allow flexibility em framework 
various emotional thresholds decay properties emotions specified produce various levels emotional restraint 
way emotion affects behavior flexible 
emotions names names emotions processed 
distress emotion occur event causes agent goal fail distress emotion lead normally consider behavior 
indirection provided behavioral features system allows customize emotions influence behavior 
just easy model distress causing enthusiasm aggression depression withdrawal 
continue study flexibility mechanism able achieve emotional expressiveness agent builders want 
tok architecture em system shown promise modeling broad emotional agents 
particular em provide power model fairly deep phenomena including personal cultural standards attitudes interpersonal relationships emotions level personality 
em interesting successfully integrated action architecture influences influenced workings em 
em shows promise flexible model agents oz world builders want 
detailed account behavior achieved system see :10.1.1.47.9057:10.1.1.45.3214
obstacles current exists lyotard cat animated final goal broad agent architecture 
improvements emotional social modeling require extensions tok em 
tok plan add models internal states agents allow generation emotions happy add internal physical world simulation improve forward looking emotions hope fear help estimating likelihood goal success generating joy distress emotions
