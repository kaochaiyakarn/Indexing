brief multicast conferencing 
background multicast conferencing traditionally shared packet networks allow low cost transmission computer data considered suitable real time multimedia applications 
circuit switched networks users allocated specific amount bandwidth shared networks provide best effort service 
traffic bandwidth data separate streams audio video shared workspace held queues delivered possible 
assumed delays size files required represent digitised audio video shared networks support real time audio video applications 
view changed due major developments increase available bandwidth efficient compression schemes implementation multicast routing 
countries high speed networks put place years 
uk example high speed academic network 
efficient video compression schemes turletti reduced amount data needs transmitted led proliferation software codecs run computer workstations 
require certain amount processing power allow processing digitised audio video data flexibility 
implementation multicast routing deering amount bandwidth required multimedia traffic reduced substantially 
apart cost multicast conferencing significant advantage 
telephony isdn conferencing support point point way conferences sessions participants require advance booking incur charges high number circuits required 
contrast multicast conferencing internet scales small conferences audiences 
increasingly popular small number experimental sites late multicast backbone mbone network grown sites worldwide offered service academic network providers 
large scale events transmitted worldwide range technical conferences shuttle launches 
europe mice project handley successfully multimedia conferencing internet international research cooperation europe australia 
collaborative research projects including industrial ones internet conferencing weekly project meetings improve communication coordination team members time reducing amount travel required 
internet conferencing different applications grows need accurate information quality requirements 
multicast audio digitised audio information sent packets duration ms mbone audio subject various problems high background noise poor quality headphones resulting echo significant packet loss
