infosleuth addresses problems levels roughly divided resource agents value mapping agents 
resource agents implement traditional ontologybased mapping strategies data

value mapping agents infosleuth takes approach encapsulating common sophisticated value mapping services separate value mapping agents 
services include mappings involve reasoning changing equivalence classes mappings involve multiple ontologies 
agents map query terms data canonical value domains 
users query view data whichever value domain prefer user agents perform value mapping necessary communicate agents canonical value domain 
furthermore resource agents advertise canonical value domain internally different value domain
