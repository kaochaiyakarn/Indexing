motivation 
knowledge representation languages classical logics order predicate logic monotonic sense statement oe derived knowledge base oe derived larger knowledge base 
property advantage inferences drawn need revised additional information comes 
leads disadvantage adding information contradicting drawn inferences leads inconsistency knowledge base useless 
applications knowledge world application domain represented incomplete way 
wants draw plausible available knowledge inferences justified reasoning classical logic plausible considering available knowledge 
situation newly acquired information may show plausible wrong 
lead inconsistency knowledge base withdrawal plausible 
start simple examples illustrate situations nonmonotonic inference methods desirable 
default rules apply individuals resp 
typical normal individuals 
example may consider property edges semantic networks 
network default rule frogs normally green 
rule applied information contradicting 
long know frog deduce green 
rule applied grass frogs known green brown 
closed world assumption cwa assumes default available information complete 
assertion derived classical inference methods knowledge base cwa deduces negation 
assumption example employed relational databases logic programming languages negation failure 
example may consider train connections timetable connection contained timetable conclude exist 
learn connection contained timetable withdraw 
frame problem comes domain modelling actions 
context important describe properties changed remain unchanged application action 
usually application action changes aspects world 
example sending manuscript article publisher changed location hopefully content 
called frame axioms describe properties remain unchanged application action 
usually large number axioms try avoid having state explicitly 
possible solution problem employ nonmonotonic inference rule says normally aspects world explicitly changed action remain invariant application 
approaches nonmonotonic reasoning 
literature great variety different approaches nonmonotonic reasoning introduced best approach 
positive development fact results clarifying connection different approaches obtained see :10.1.1.33.1782
briefly introduce important types approaches 
consistency approaches reiter default logic typical example consider nonmonotonic rules form normally implies 
rule applied inserted knowledge base holds inserting destroy consistency knowledge base 
example may default rule frogs normally green 
assume knowledge base contains information grass frogs brown 
individual brown green 
grass frogs frogs 
frog 
grass frog 
case default rule applied 
major problem consistency approach solve question resolve conflicts different rules applying default rules different order may lead different results 
illustrate problem assume strict information grass frogs brown replaced defeasible information grass frogs normally brown information remains 
default rules applicable 
soon applied longer applicable 
decide possible results preferred conflict resolved due priorities rules information deduced unresolved situation 
example concerning influenced conflict 
modal nonmonotonic logic example proposed mcdermott doyle 
logic allows diamond operator written moe intuitively read oe consistent 
default rule frogs normally green written implication frog green 
order treat implication correctly logic needs additional inference rule able derive formulae form moe intended semantics 
principle inference rule allows deduce moe oe deduced 
simple may sound faced cyclic dependency formulae form oe deducible depends inference rule defined 
doyle mcdermott solve problem introducing appropriated fixed point semantics 
representative class modal nonmonotonic logics known autoepistemic logic 
classical predicate logic notion logical consequence defined respect models set formulae 
preferential semantics takes logical consequences formulae hold preferred models preferred models usually defined minimal models respect preference relation interpretations 
illustrate idea consider simple example propositional logic 
assume propositional variables different interpretations false true false false true true 
assume preference relation smaller interpretation preferred larger 
empty set formulae interpretations model means minimal model 
particular consequence respect preferential semantics 
set fqg excludes interpretations remaining models incomparable minimal models 
hold longer deduced 
shows preferential semantics yields nonmonotonic formalism 
important example preferential semantics case predicate logic circumscription 
goal minimize extension predicate interpretation preferred interpretation ae holds 
default rules frogs normally green expressed help abnormality predicate minimized frog ab green exceptions rule introduced implications brown ab 
fact ab minimized sure default rule applied individual known exception
