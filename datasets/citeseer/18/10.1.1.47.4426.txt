view science science effort understand going universe detailed arguments comprehensive position philosophy science clearly scope 
order assess scientific credentials need platform 
propose adopt view science outlined chalmers known unrepresentative realism 
unrepresentative entities scientific theories seen literal representations reality speculative predictive explanatory value realism assumed exists reality independent human minds human scientific project 
selected chalmers account coherent way deals problematic issues common position philosophy science 
firstly chalmers realist really universe science attempts gain knowledge imperfect universe 
philosophers science van fraassen suggested assumption external reality superfluous scientific theories regarded pragmatic instruments allow successful predictions 
known 
chalmers arguments concomitant anti realism centre fact scientific theory derived empirical domain proves unexpectedly useful 
chalmers point refuse postulate existence underlying objective reality face sort evidence 
anti realism suggests encourages deep unnecessary conservatism scientific practice 
realism ultimately just assumption fine argued weak realist thesis basic engagement world theories science go long way justify highly counter intuitive stance 
chalmers called view universe exclusively physical nature took mat ter universe away left 
assumption widespread current science philosophy popularity presumably stems modern entities immaterial minds vital 
paired methodological reductionism notion scientific explanation best done terms reducing set phenomena study lower level description reducing classical genetics molecular genetics chemistry physics 
chalmers position explicitly agrees bhaskar 
operations higher level accounted solely laws governing level say higher order level rooted say emergent 
chalmers embraces emergence idea variously defined 
strongest sense emergent property high level property arises low level constituents predictable reducible constituents 
standard example philosophical literature water molecule matter knew properties hydrogen oxygen claimed able predict properties water transparency furthermore statements properties water reduced statements hydrogen oxygen molecular chemistry emergent respect atomic chemistry 
kim sceptical notion referring magical emergence suggests violates basic assumption special causal powers appear higher levels description 
contrast davidson argued irreducibility mental physical mind emergent phenomenon 
dennett clark show weaker sense emergence justified epistemological basis 
limitations absolute reductionism recall laplacean ideal possible need concept emergence order sense things 
clark discusses term put argues weak functional conception emergent phenomena simply arise result collective activity opposed action dedicated component control system 
chalmers maintain supported scientific theories objective facts follows earlier philosophers science 
hume noting inferences experience suppose foundation resemble past showed truth law scientific generalization justified basis number past observations 
popper proposed scientific theories true best falsified 
quine kuhn went arguing theory statements stand fall body theory surrounds truth falsity single theory statement indeterminate 
chalmers accepts arguments accordingly views scientific theories true false models reality face empirical evidence wider epistemological context 
idea theories begs question distinctions 
question exactly counts better theory trivial 
regrettably space discuss problem refer passing pragmatic criteria occam razor minimum description length principle states best theory minimizes total length theory description data encoded theory 
quine put man scientific heritage plus continuing sensory stimulation considerations guide warping scientific heritage fit continuing sensory rational pragmatic 
summary chalmers account science avoids fruitless questions really electrons considering entities processes scientific theories models world really 
science models perfect thought true may replaced tomorrow better model proposed 
may pessimistic notion science chalmers presumably say reflects epistemological better available account 
dennett argues similar position calls view mild realism 
dennett uses conway game life examples argue high level patterns mildly real rejects binary opposition real thing vs fictional explanatory construct 
sets tone asking familiar categories voices centres gravity regarded real moves argue human beliefs intentional states deserve place ontology see dennett 
dennett view beliefs example really neurological states cells life plane 
theorizing higher level entities justified gives imperfect predictive ability spares computational cost theories physical level 
dennett concludes position intermediate realism
