reading dreams animators ai researchers finds groups speaking thinking feeling living creatures creating illusion life building apparently autonomous entities people especially creators genuinely care

thomas johnston properly emotional reactions character requires animator remember key points 
emotional state character clearly defined 
animator needs know state moment viewer able attribute definite emotional status character 

thought process reveals feeling 
disney technique claims action shows thought processes viewers see emotions character thinking influenced clearly defined emotional state 
emotion construct believable agents edge intention 
accentuate emotion 
time wisely establish emotion convey viewers situation 
people grasp emotional state situations immediately 
believable characters depend appropriate variety mechanisms convey emotion fore shadowing emotion simultaneous action get main point

particular requirement emotional state represented obvious way agent agent world system 
building chose develop goal directed behavior architecture action loyall bates brooks maes couple distinct component generating representing expressing emotion ortony collins clore occ ortony bates 
action system planning world modeling minimalist conception goals manipulate dynamically changing set behaviors 
goals agent events respect goals key producing clearly defined emotional state creature 
choices emotions explicit allow composition behaviors goals intended easy build characters specific personalities maintaining robustness robots minimal representation 
building occ theory emotion gives creatures definite emotional reactions events 
simple example creating analog anger experiences important goal failure judges failure caused 
occurs emotions various intensities exist simultaneously 
part finding ways combine get primary emotions adequate clarity satisfy maxim 
sure solutions adequate reilly bates continuing explore problem 
second maxim creature emotional state change thought processes emotional state visible actions 
emotion mapped personality specific way behavioral feature 
instance fear emotion mapped feature shrimp aggressive feature wolf 
features local systemic effects action generating components architecture 
attempted build behaviors combination features produce action conveyed features 
behavioral features intended abstraction mechanism build library modular behaviors character 
constructed individual modules wanted emotion affect action ad hoc ways depend breaking abstraction barriers frequently 
debate oz group essential quality characters possible find durable abstractions mapping emotion action 
argument abstraction comes experience shrimp 
due programming error shrimp occasionally peppers ongoing behavior nervous tick causing repeatedly hit head ground 
attracts people attention immediately surprise build psycho logical theories incorrect shrimp mental state find interesting alive having behavior 
reaction appears consistent chuck jones famous success animating bugs bunny warner brothers characters says key insight animation 
year old cat named johnson liked eat wear eaten head 
jones says discovered quirk gives personality character personality gives life 
architectures support quirks may mean need allow regularities expressed abstraction barriers broken 
consider third maxim 
took care design architecture provided strong internal emotional states 
animation techniques exaggeration anticipation staging nearly extent necessary emotions quickly recognizable 
example insufficient exaggeration behavior 
directly expresses sadness decreasing muscle tone decreasing length jumps slowing timing actions 
creator behavior reported started thought reasonable looking behavior wasn clear doubled relevant parameters got people recognize pointed 
anticipation denotes broadcasting advance certain action occur people prepare see 
necessary realistic timing causes events happen quickly people experienced 
analogy people watching unfamiliar sport unable see happening learn predict near events 
classic example anticipation animation occurs character back preparation rapid forward motion 
strictly speaking unrealistic essential people grasp meaning motion 
staging theater animation refer controlling action characters time space sure main point situation conveyed 
moment edge intention moving jumping gesturing socially 
difficult people interacting creatures stay aware happening 
simultaneous action may realistic goal specifically produce confusion user helpful producing subjective feeling realism 
talked idea believable agents mean interactive analog believable characters discussed arts 
tried argue artists hold central goals ai researchers insights important try build engaging apparently living creatures 
creatures interest ai researchers artists may serve component new user interfaces broad human population 
chuck jones describing animation warner brothers jones said believability 
striving belief life characters 
dictionary definition meaning word animation invoke life 
emotion primary means achieve believability illusion life helps know characters really care happens world truly desires 
contrast fighting characters current video games show reaction tremendous violence 
showing reaction key making characters believable engaging characters engender concern merely symbols action 
mentioned implied times illusion life refers strong subjective sense realism 
wish distinguish notion genuine life refer entities really alive opposed merely 
just distinction course subject deep debate 
turing test dennett intensional stance dennett ideas substance try get issue 
note fundamental philosophical concern remains practical concern constructing agents increasing degrees believability short term 
sufficient success regard may alter eliminate philosophical debate happened practice meets theory 
case view believability arise copying reality 
artists reality service realism example carefully studying nature elevate fundamental goal 
mimicking reality method appropriate convey strong subjective sense realism 
art lead charge 
believability places variety demands interactive character 
include appearance reactivity goals emotions situated social competence 
emphasis alternative ai reactivity seen choosing believability requirements elevating position importance downgrading qualities related idealized view intelligence
