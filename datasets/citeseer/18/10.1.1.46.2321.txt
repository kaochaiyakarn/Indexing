term science means state fact knowing class things objects phenomena observation identification description experimental investigation theoretical explanation objects phenomena 
term engineering means application scientific mathematical principles practical ends design manufacture operation efficient economical structures machines processes systems order artificial objects desired properties function

various mathematical natural social scientific literature probably difficult impossible find sentence form generally describe various definitions propositions theorems laws sentence form 
logic sentence form usually called conditional proposition simply conditional states exists relationship sufficient condition part part sentence 
mathematical natural social scientists conditionals descriptions various definitions propositions theorems laws connect concept fact situation sufficient conditions 
major scientists discover sufficient condition relations various phenomena data laws research fields 
general conditional concern parts connected connective called antecedent consequent conditional respectively

logic conditional called empirical conditional logic truth value sense logic depends contents antecedent consequent determined form viewpoint logic relevant relation antecedent consequent conditional regarded empirical conditional called logical conditional logic truth value sense logic depends form contents antecedent consequent considered universally true false viewpoint logic relevant relation antecedent consequent conditional regarded logical 
logical conditional considered universally true sense logic called entailment logic 
intrinsic difference various different logic systems regard class conditionals entailments diaz pointed problem modern logic best put follows give explanation conditionals represent entailment relation
