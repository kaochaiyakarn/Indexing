describe recommendation system automatically recommending high quality web documents users similar interests arbitrarily narrow information domains 
user centric virtual communities consisting members recommendations deemed highly relevant respect particular information domain automatically formed 
preliminary results show virtual collaborative communities defined able dynamically modify boundaries allow changes user interests 
obtaining relevant quality information world wide web notoriously difficult problem 
large growing number distributed hypermedia consisting documents links indexes hard locate relevant information 
relieve users burden information search retrieval filtering tasks building intelligent tools automate tasks investigated 
common model achieve involves creating maintaining description user profile type information user interested retrieving web 
user profile acts filter ensure information matching interests user retrieved user 
user profile generated ways 
firstly user responsible providing keywords phrases summarises particular information domain interest 
secondly information filtering system learn user profile automatically monitoring user normal web browsing activities recognising patterns material content user discovers 
text documents filtered comparing user profile document profile pattern similarity metric 
document profile generated traditional information retrieval techniques techniques natural language processing 
user likes document weight generated similarity metric update user profile 
referred relevance feedback 
different filtering systems user profile model exist including webwatcher law syskill webert 
learning approach simple easy implement shortcomings 
firstly information filtering system uses priori domain knowledge usually requires long time document instances adequately generate user profile information domain 
system require examples user considers relevant information accurate predictions 
secondly system necessarily rank documents highly similar ones seen 
system limited actions experiences single user draw experiences users may generated similar user profiles 
user feedback factor affecting system performance 
overcome deficiencies user profile filtering systems collaborative filtering model adopted 
model system automatically retrieves filters documents considering recommendations feedback users documents 
effect system evaluates similarity documents user profile evaluating similarity different users 
users feedback problem minimised fewer document recommendations single user required 
community users similar interests build faster accurate profiles 
collaboration conducive serendipitous information discovery allowing users draw experiences users related information domains adapt discoveries domain 
collaborative filtering particularly apt information domains relatively stable content due large variety different users providing feedback set documents 
collaborative filtering systems broadly categorised active automated collaborative filtering systems 
active system user actively identify users similar interests collaboration beneficial 
place large demands users define group collaborators 
hand automated collaborative filtering systems alleviate demands automatically generating collaboration groups 
furthermore systems potentially encompass larger global collaboration groups 
active collaborative filtering systems developed including firefly beehive fab 
firefly offers collaboration specialised domains music movies learning tastes users forming neighbourhoods users similar interests purpose recommendation 
determines statistical correlation items rated users recommends new items user 
attempt predictions items groups 
beehive monitors individuals user interacts mail builds table corresponding different communities individuals 
content frequency user daily communication determines group membership criteria 
beehive allows collaboration arbitrary information domains scope collaboration limited small workgroups 
fab uses set collection agents document collection form index storage space set selection agents responsible document distribution users collaboration group 
collection stage generates clusters interests tracks changing tastes users 
fab presently supports small number users time limited number collection agents

recommendation filtering module filters urls retrieves document compares document summary user 
urls module considers highly relevant user associated annotations subsequently user perusal 
user rates url scale relevance feedback module ratings modify user refine description user interests tastes
