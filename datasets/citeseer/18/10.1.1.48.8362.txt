planning 
planning applied coordination means developing explicit plan accounts nodes actions interactions achieving specific goals 
planning cdps ai traditionally viewed developing ordered set operations achieve desired goal assuming changes state world due planned operations 
multiple agents involved plans usually include synchronization actions agents enforce important orderings actions 
multiagent plans formed single centralized agent planning distributed multiple agents

second reason multiagent planning little application multiagent plans coordinated detailed levels requires accurate stable models goals actions domain 
dsn tasks dynamic unpredictable planning dsn interpretation tasks assume detailed coordination coordinate level order maintain flexibility recover unexpected events

organizations communication assume nodes initialized commonly known organizational information roles interests responsibilities 
example sensors dsn statically arranged node knows region responsible types problems solve nodes responsible neighboring regions capabilities 
just knowing possible roles responsibilities nodes guarantee coordinated problem solving 
example node recognizes vehicle tracking entered sensor region neighbor surmise neighbor tracking vehicle 
neighbor performing tasks considers important tracking vehicles node knowledge integrating important partial tracks group nodes 
organization improves coordination providing guidelines nodes cooperate gives nodes flexibility potentially interact uncoordinated ways 
organizations restrict nodes narrow ranges tasks remove flexibility introduces different inefficiencies specialized nodes sit idle particular capabilities needed
