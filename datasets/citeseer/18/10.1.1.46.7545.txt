assertion imply eats fillers independent fillers vegetables 
albeit high computational cost compute probabilityof description disjunctions existentials assert terminological properties involving constructs semantics 
type correlation fillers dealt fairly easily framework

properties fillers individual chosen recursive calls functions appropriate classes 
view filler function pass relevant properties individual diet parameter function 
parameters directly influence distribution filler properties

addition arguments stochastic function return values 
context feature allow properties object depend fillers 
example probability level attribute depend actual fat content foods eaten person 
represent type dependency introducing node bayesian network corresponding complex concept eats low fat 
node representing child new node encoding desired dependency 
general fillers recursively pass back truth value deeply nested complex concepts
