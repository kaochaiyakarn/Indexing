form specification specification language adaptive forms context free grammars 
notation similar backus naur form augmented labels attached non terminal left hand side production 
labels generate prompts fields headers menus 
grammar rules illustrate notation evacuate evacuate domestic animals civilians law enforcement personnel city county convention writing grammar specification symbols quotes represent non terminal symbols grammar symbols single quotes domestic animals represent terminals grammar symbols double quotes labels attached non terminals 
developers think grammar defining set sentences user enter language parsing view defining data users enter structured editor view 
encourage structured editor view non terminals represent object types terminals represent literal values type 
production shown illustrates specification structured object containing attributes 
terminal evacuate thought marker structured object distinguish objects having attributes types 
terminal thought marker attribute distinguish objects structure 
second production defines primitive type specifies values instances type 
third production illustrates definition sub types 
type defined having subtypes city county 
means attribute declared hold filled city county

important aspect adaptive forms trivial extend specification include new data 
example suppose want extend form allow intersection streets building lincoln boulevard way 
modify rule include new element called define new rule city county location building road road adaptive forms interpreter constructs forms appropriate 
system set produce short forms initial form look described fields 
user selects building fourth field interpreter determines user entering location adds new fields form enter roads pre filled 
system set produce expanded forms initial form contain fields fields original example plus new fields required evacuation intersection 
new fields marked optional user fill enters building field location city county name entered 
happens system knows user entering converts fields optional required 
user enter building optional fields removed 
show complete grammar generate screen shots running example

forward look ahead zero look ahead compare experience optimal forward look ahead optimal look ahead zero 
obvious trade overly shallow look ahead leaves users dark overly deep look ahead may confuse large number fields 
addition deeper look ahead demands computational resources encountered situation issue 
related system closely related texas instruments implements interactive parser grammar albeit aimed natural language understanding 
simple tiled columns layout presenting possible sentences collapse entered part sentence keeps showing choices past fields consume large amount screen space 
type grammars parsing algorithms systems different 
accepts ambiguous grammars uses parser push automata 
adaptive forms driven unambiguous grammar uses recursive descent parser 
research confused earlier syntax directed editors see overview focus forms simple languages general purpose programming languages 
tools building forms support dynamic hiding exposure fields 
system written tcl tk runs web browser written tcl tk 
allows developers write tcl scripts executed time user enters value field 
allows scripts modify form adding deleting fields 
achieve dynamic behavior developer needs attach script field create define layout new fields careful write scripts remove fields longer needed 
system done automatically 
nice aspect scripts purposes validating input dynamically calling application procedures generate menus plan extend adaptive forms application programming interface allow developers define procedures dynamically compute set terminals non terminal perform input validation cumbersome impossible encode grammar

air campaign planning application standalone java application application shown adaptive forms different purposes entering structured objectives centered sub window providing command line style interaction editor addition direct manipulation lower left sub window 
central motivation developing adaptive forms artificial intelligence applications need receive input objectives structured form ordinary humans tend resist having overly formal specification language adaptive forms mechanism great compromise conflicting goals certain applications 
lower right sub window shows artificial intelligence application built inspect air campaign plans consulting domain specific knowledge base 
fully implemented adaptive forms mechanism pure html pages java servlets 
shows exact air campaign planning application world wide web incarnation forms enabled web browser java plug ins required 
nice side effect adaptive forms user input domain specific application code written level abstraction slightly higher toolkits making colored indented tables output code versions identical 

air campaign planning application html application recursion grammar currently prohibits form recursion possible specify non terminal appear variable number times 
limitation apparent database query application adaptive forms possible sentence select 
number clauses variable application 
current gap measure fixed number non terminals called expand epsilon null clause 
envisioned solution allow recursion grammar enhance run time interpreter detecting cycles 
upcoming variable number fields ellipsis optional fields clause clause 
application programming interface api domain encountered need application programming interface lets controlling application adapt grammar user moves 
specific situation imagine tables database attributes query language allows arbitrary joins 
impossible compute static grammar encompassing possibilities front combinatorial explosion involved 
skeleton grammar read choices computed database user goes approach currently investigated sims project 
experience adaptive forms limited encouraging 
system constructing editor allows air campaign planners specify objectives rules constructing database query interface rules 
objectives editor allows users enter different kinds objectives developed consultation domain experts 
simulated exercises deployed routine

grammar objectives editor built handed developers integrated software
