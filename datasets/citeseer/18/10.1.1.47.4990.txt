fair share scheduler 
kay university sydney bell laboratories cpu schedulers usually designed allocate resources fairly processes 
describe share scheduler allocates resources users get fair machine share long period 
describe hierarchical form share supports sharing individual users groups users 
particular supports sharing machine organisational groups independently funded contributed proportion machine cost 
hierarchical share ensures group allocated defined machine share long term 

critical requirements scheduler fair traditionally interpreted context processes meant schedulers designed share resources fairly processes

typically schedulers increase priority constant 
intuitively view difference share typical schedulers follows typical scheduler adjusts priority current process pushing queue processes constant amount share pushes current process queue amount proportional usage number active processes process owner inversely proportional square user shares processes belonging higher usage active users pushed queue processes belonging lower usage active users 
means process belonging user high usage takes longer drift back front queue 
priority needs longer decay point lowest 
want users able rate proportional shares 
means charges incur allowed increase proportion square shares gives derivative rate done proportional shares 
formula takes account number active processes processes priority queue user owns current process 
necessary priority increment involved just usage shares push single process queue far ensure user gets fair share 
user active process need penalise ensure user share spread multiplying priority increment active process count
