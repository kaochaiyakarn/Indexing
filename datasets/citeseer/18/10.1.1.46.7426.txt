information retrieval ir begins user having information need wishes fulfil 
information need form query denoted automatic ir system query languages 
answers form documents suit user need ir system 
content document represented specific set descriptors denoted taken descriptor language 
set obtained process termed indexing 
ir driven process called matching request compared 
matching operation deems document sufficiently similar query document assumed relevant returned user 
relevance connection document information need 
years attempts define logic ir carried 
earliest approaches directed classical logics boolean logic 
basis logical model ir originates cooper introduced objective notion relevance termed logical relevance 
cooper provides formal definition relevance terms logical consequences 
query logical consequence document document deemed relevant 
order confusion call logical relevance relation aboutness 
aboutness derivation rigid strict document logically relevant respect query 
aboutness degrees documents classified respect plausibility aboutness query 
van rijsbergen pointed problem proposed non classical logic ir 
van rijsbergen leaves open problem choice appropriate logic represent documents queries system knowledge inference process deal involved uncertainty 
consequence key problem research paradigm selection adequate logic task 
choice depends mainly ability logic model uncertain retrieval process 
criteria may considered expressiveness computation complexity especially multimedia documents involved
