security identification card computers big brother obsolete david chaum may soon personal card computer handle payments transactions protect security privacy new ways organizations society large 
computerization individuals ability monitor control ways information 
public private sector organizations acquire extensive personal information exchange 
individuals way knowing information inaccurate outdated inappropriate may find accused falsely denied access services 
new serious dangers derive computerized pattern recognition techniques small group tapping data gathered everyday consumer transactions secretly conduct mass surveillance inferring individuals activities associations 
automation payment consumer transactions expanding dangers unprecedented extent 
organizations hand attracted efficiency cost cutting opportunities automation 
vulnerable cash checks consumer credit insurance social services abused individuals 
obvious solution organizations ways pervasive interlinked records combination national identity cards fingerprints 
resulting potential misuse data effect individuals 
essentially approach electronic payment automated systems tried 
systems require massive investment years complete underlying architecture quietly decided institutional momentum growing 
momentum driving seemingly irreconcilable conflict organizations need security benefits automation side individuals need ensured privacy protections 
conflict may avoided early adoption fundamentally different approach automating transaction systems 
new approach mutually advantageous increases organizations benefits automating including improved security frees individuals surveillance potential data linking dangers unchecked record keeping 
advanced techniques offer wider reduced cost greater consumer convenience protection 
long run holds promise enhancing economic freedom democratic process informational rights 
new approach differs major differences define new approach 
identifying information 
currently western countries require citizens carry documents bearing universal identification numbers 
drivers licenses upgraded perform similar function united states efforts machine readable national identity documents expanding internationally 
organizations routinely essentially identifying data name birthday birthplace name address match link records organizations 
new approach individual uses different account number digital pseudonym organization 
identifying information 
casual purchase shop example time pseudonym series transactions comprising ongoing relationship bank account single pseudonym repeatedly 
input individuals process pseudonyms created ensured pseudonyms linked 
input yields exclusive ability authenticate ownership pseudonyms 
organizations protect participation forming pseudonyms safeguards limit individuals pseudonym organization ensure individuals held accountable abuses created pseudonyms 
second difference mechanism conduct transactions 
today individuals hold variety tokens issued organizations 
range traditional documents plastic cards magnetic optical stripes embedded microcomputers 
tokens usually owned issuing organization contain information dual holder decipher modify 
spread automatic teller point sale terminals individuals asked perform transactions directly computer controlled equipment 
terminals microcomputers current tokens physically tamper resistant contain secret numeric keys securely code communication central computers 
individuals derive little direct benefit security provisions transaction mechanism take faith information displays revealing secrets 
new approach individual conducts transactions personal card computer 
resemble credit card sized calculator include character display keyboard short range communication capability television remote control 
computers bought constructed just personal computer need secrets structures owners 
simple automatic teller machines 
purchase shop example equipment point sale transmits description goods cost card displays information owner 
card owner allows transaction simply entering secret authorizing number card keyboard 
number owner allow transaction lost stolen card computer little 
lost card full capabilities readily installed replacement backup data saved secure encoded form home 
third defining difference kind security provided 
current systems emphasize sided security organizations attempting protect individuals new approach allows parties protect interests 
relies individuals card computers withholding secret keys organizations organizations computers devising secret keys withheld individuals 
transactions parties keys form specially coded confirmations transaction details exchange yields evidence sufficient resolve errors disputes 
systems new approach depend currently codes secure organizations abuses individuals 
codes cryptographic broken principle trying guessed keys 
guessing infeasible enormous number possible keys 
short proofs security known cryptographic codes 
feasible attacks 
contrast 
security card computers provide individuals linking pseudonyms unconditional simple mathematical proofs show appropriate systems collusion organizations tapping communication lines yield information link pseudonyms regardless clever attack computation uses 
summary large scale automated systems consumer transactions built new approach offers far attractive way structure 
specific advantages individuals organizations society large argued final section 
intervening sections expand desirability practicality comprehensive set transaction types communication payments credentials

applicability benefits growing computer telecommunications infrastructures mature 
communication system proposed practical advent large scale consumer electronic mail allow home payment credential systems 
clearly illustrates concepts central immediately applicable systems 
communication transactions messages travel electromagnetic digital form easier learn individuals communication 
exposure ot message content obvious danger addressed known coding techniques 
subtle difficult problem current communication systems exposure tracing information 
impor tant kind tracing information today individuals addresses organizations require commonly sell mailing lists 
trend greater information 
comprehensive computerized data calls instance increasingly collected maintained telephone companies 
electronic mail systems new telephone systems proposed integrated services networks automatically deliver tracing information message 
information available mass basis pattern individual relationships laid bare 
furthermore tracing information identifier link records individual held organizations individual communicates 
long communication systems allow system providers organizations eavesdroppers obtain tracing information unsuitable new approach growing threat individuals ability determine information 
side issue current systems offer organizations society large inadequate protection individuals forge messages falsely claim sent received messages 
communication handwritten signatures easily forged pass routine checking signature samples verified cer tainty expert witnesses 
receipts delivery costly transac tions solely handwritten signatures usually indicate message content 
computerized systems come wider potential abuse individuals increase 
solving problems current approach attempted obvious ways providing recipients sender address installing tamper resistant identity card readers entry point communication system keeping records messages allow certification delivery 
security measures tracing information fundamental conflict individuals ability monitor control information 
sets problems solved new approach 
nature solution individuals able send receive messages releasing tracing information receivers show messages fact sent despite denial senders senders show messages fact received despite denial receivers message content kept confidential 
messages untraceable person electronic mail computer conceals unconditionally secure way messages sends receives 
prevent denial sender sender cryptographically codes messages way receiver check prevents able imitate sender coded signature 
concepts untraceability coded signatures recur intertwined payment credential transac tion types separate subsections 
unconditional untraceability easy principle prevent message sent organization traced individual recipient 
organization simply broadcasts messages individuals individual electronic mail computer scans broadcasts messages addressed owner pseudonyms 
individual computer knows broadcast messages owner obtains 
preventing message sent organization traced back individual sender requires novel techniques physical transmission principle traced source 
concept techniques illustrated hypothetical situation 
suppose friends invite restaurant 
dinner waiter comes table mentions paid dinner say

codebooks constructed pairing words random front half book pairs ordered words back half second words 
instance spy front half shows back half shows spy 
construct codebook communication organization 
keep front half private key give back half organization digital pseudonym organization 
sending message organization translate word message code private key encoded form message called digital signature 
organization receives digital signature translates back original english message digital pseudonym 
immensely useful property digital signatures resistance forgery 
organization digital pseudonym easily forge digital signature 
forgery entail creating digital pseudonym decodes sensible english message 
codebook analogy course forgery merely requires searching completely re sorting second words half book digital pseudonym 
actual digital signature cryptographic techniques currently forgery thought require computation infeasible fastest computers working millions years 
organization forge digital signature successfully claim sent message fact send 
third party arbiter decide favor organization organization show digital signature yields disputed message translated digital pseudonym 
forgery infeasible organization obtain digital signature signed encoded disputed message private key 
organization create private key corresponding digital pseudonym codebook keep private key front half widely disseminating corresponding digital pseudonym back half 
private key transform messages digital signatures sending individuals 
organization individual create single private key corresponding digital pseudonym digital signatures sends 
receiving signed message organization decode organization single publicly disseminated digital pseudonym commonly called public key 
signatures allow individuals convince organization necessary message fact sent organization 
payment credential systems introduced sections digital signatures formed organizations play important role 
digital signatures practice actual digital signatures realized numbers adapted keep message content confidential certify delivery 
practical computerized digital signature techniques just codebook analogy done digit numbers

credential transactions relationships organizations legitimate needs individuals show credentials 
term credentials mean statements concerning individual issued organizations general shown organizations 
past credentials primarily took form certificates driver licenses membership cards 
computerization certificates provided individuals substantial control access credentials certificates revealed unnecessary identifying information address birthdate various numbers 
today identifying information link records certificate holders allows denied services reports organizations may erroneous obsolete inappropriate decision hand 
certificate required shown application tax forms similarly unnecessary overly detailed information demanded presumably allow confirmation 
confirmation link information lead back inappropriate records 
control credential information certificates provided individuals circumvented rendered illusory computerization 
problem credentials subject widespread abuse individuals easily modify copy kinds plastic certificates today technol ogy 
reason certificates effect reduced role providing identi fying information organizations maintaining credentials 
check credential information organizations rapidly deploying called matching techniques identifying information link share records individuals 
organizations may need ability blacklist individuals determine 
number organizations grows certificates matching techniques impractical creation large centralized databases individuals 
multiple complete identities sophisticated criminals related problem 
communication payments obvious countermeasures current approach widespread highly secure identity documents linked centrally maintained credentials direct conflict individuals ability determine information 
new approach solution individual transform specially coded credential issued pseudonym similarly coded form credential shown individual pseudonyms 
coded credentials maintained shown individuals return control similar provided certificates convenient obviate need credentials matching 
individuals tailor coded form show ensure appropriate information revealed particular decisions ensure obsolete information unlinkable current pseudonyms 
abuses credentials individuals forgery improper modification sharing prevented cryptographic coding protocols 
person able pseudonym organization requiring protection multiple complete identities prevented 
accountability abuses individual pseudonyms assured need centralized databases 
basic credential system essential concept illustrated analogy carbon lined envelopes time envelopes windows

organizations routinely modify queries include requirement adult citizens filed tax forms year 
blacklist complied barring relationships organizations 
actual widespread organizations may occasionally need blacklist individuals mechanism practical desirable queries demand vast numbers credentials individuals unable protect organizations contact 
authorized blacklisting lists problems wider solved techniques require organization obtain directly individual authorization blacklist individual specified reason 
organizations insist authorizations appropriate establishing extending relationships 
way techniques illustrated applying envelope analogy buying goods credit 
special row zones reserved slip purpose 
provide shop credit purchase envelope addition window may ordinarily shop window exposing reserved zones 
shop broadcasts numeric pseudonym sees written reserved zone organization objects shop assured exclusive zone 
pay shop gives resolution credential signature mark credential signature marks previously described single zone applies 
reserved zones remain unused show agency obtains exclusive unneeded zones way shops issues resolution signature mark

preventing information mechanisms new approach guarantee individuals time review credential information required unconditionally ensure ability shed informa tion outdated 
individuals expect receive resolution credentials cooling interval needed minute may time resolve errors disputes unnecessary consequences occur 
organizations may wish increase maximum delay blacklisting takes effect cooling interval provided doing 
example different resolution credential valid calendar month organizations provide just month maximum delay blacklisting takes effect month cooling interval 
maximum delay maintained providing cooling intervals half month long twice month organizations issue credentials expire month issue date credential remains valid half month interval scheduled issue successor 
individuals change pseudonyms periodically linked obsolete information 
initial information associated new pseudonyms provided transfer credentials previous pseudonyms 
staggered allow time completion pending business 
additional benefits changing pseudonyms obsolete information
