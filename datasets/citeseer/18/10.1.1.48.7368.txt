routing algorithm quite similar routing algorithm trec minor variations 
tried various new techniques improve routing algorithm techniques tried yielded better results algorithm 
approach clustering known relevant articles query 
main thought approach relevance multiple aspects 
example query trade barriers japan aspect relevant documents trade barriers automobile industry keywords ford mitsubishi aspect trade barriers electronics industry keywords toshiba sony 
isolate patterns relevant documents possible learn query aspect query better global query routing documents related aspect 
unfortunately unable improve routing performance approach mainly believe due reasons queries clearly defined multiple aspects relevance cluster documents select aspect amount training data relevant non relevant documents aspect resulting poorer feedback query single query incorporates multiple aspects relevance example feedback query example keywords aspects ford mitsubishi toshiba sony implicitly giving benefits hoped obtain clustering
