business rules definition lot knowledge rules exist organization prescribe restrict way organizational goals achieved 
rules exist formalized way organizational handbook exist informally 
rules precisely defined allow discretion human actor 
originally business rules defined connection integrity constraints resulting cardinalities entityrelationship models sophisticated constraints defined niam 
business rules cover data integrity usually impose restrictions organizational dynamics 
purpose define business rules lh bell 
paradigm active database management systems rules consist components called eca rules 
event component indicates rule executed condition checked action component done 
business rules regarded main result system analysis phase 
eca rules may specify dynamic behavior database management systems formalizing business rules conceptual level

stepwise refinement business rules methods developing information systems provide mechanism stepwise refinement
