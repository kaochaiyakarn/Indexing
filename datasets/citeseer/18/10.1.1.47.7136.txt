developed hierarchy different levels agenthood introduce section 
levels agenthood dennett ladder 
ladder created goal different ideas compared levels agenthood 
introduce levels agenthood conte castelfranchi 
step ladder formed different interrelated concepts rationality intentionality stance 
intentional system system analyzed intentional stance 
intentional stance assumes system agent behaves rational intentional beliefs desires intentions 
dennett links communication level 
communication dennett says founded presumption rationality agents communicate 
step ladder level reciprocity 
agent level able reciprocate stance able view agents intentional systems 
agent able form beliefs desires intentions beliefs desires intentions second order intentional system 
third step ladder adds concept verbal communication capacities agent 
introduces third order intention agent intends agent recognizes intentions agent 
dennett calls genuine reciprocity 
fourth final step ladder dennett equates notion reflective self evaluation results second order desires agent wants certain beliefs desires intentions 
idea castelfranchi expression want want build formal model normative expressions 
equates persons persons ethics norms values second order desires 
dennett precisely calls top step ladder moral 
conte castelfranchi describe types agents reactive agents plan autonomous agents goal autonomous agents 
conte castelfranchi view agent goal directed system performs actions perception world applying internal representation causal relations actions consequences order achieve intention 
conte castelfranchi claim reactive agent profitable multiagent context socially responsive 
reactive agent agent conte castelfranchi definition agent reactive system links actions external stimuli internal processing 
call goal oriented system 
conte castelfranchi really distinguish types agents 
goal autonomous agents autonomous respect goals ends plan autonomous agents autonomous respect actions plans 
plan autonomous agent goals agent goals dependent

hierarchy outlined consisting levels social understanding different types information 
authors hierarchy seperate animal cognition human cognition offer explanation autism terms 
parts levels seen equivalent different models agency 
models agenthood different reasoning capabilities distinguished 
exact reasoning capability concern purposes concerned transition level 
capabilities linked autonomy agent possible content communication 
proceed dwell little different meanings autonomy dictionary 
meaning autonomy degree movements determined external stimuli 
meaning independence human mind cognitive autonomy degree choices actions governed agents 
meaning authority give oneself laws 
call norm autonomy degree choices actions governed social influences 
autonomy related self organizing capabilities 
autonomous agent higher self organizing capabilities artificial system independent designer system making emergent behavior feasible 
model reactive system perception directly coupled action deliberation associating 
reactive system means influencing environment preconceived way 
autonomy resides completely combination environmental cues properties system 
model ii trained systems perception indirectly coupled action representations incentives act 
mechanism called action activation actions triggered command set 
systems perform action possible request received 
category boiler thermostat fits command representation external temperature difference cybernetic set point triggers action turning heater
