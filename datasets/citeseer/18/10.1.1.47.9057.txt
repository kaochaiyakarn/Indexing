original lyotard task perception sensory routines integrated sense model interactive fiction world tok agent runs executing step loop sense think act 
raw sense data extracted world recorded sensory routines 
world simple perceivable world state determined recorded task independent mechanisms 
relationships objects represented links creating topological graph newly encountered world fragment 
new data marked agent internal notion time older graphs retained 
hap behaviors execute low level memory raw sense data queried information seen food kitchen minutes 
raw data recorded sensory routines attempt merge integrated sense model ism maintains agent best guess physical structure world 
requires inference including merging sense data different modalities sight sound related merging new past perceptions seemingly identical objects 
process uses partial property value pairs available sense data topological information 
higher level inferences deciding visible objects reach 
lyotard starts empty ism fragments sensory routines 
interacts world perception systems collect information 
exploring environment visually determines space connected objects placed world 
allows instance guess location favorite toy mouse various soft places sit 
executing actions result touching objects collects tactile information tactile sensory routine 
example sitting object visually appeared soft lyotard tactile sensory routine perceives records actual softness object 
object soft lyotard ism representation object change 
continuously updated information sensory routines longer term approximate model ism routinely queried choosing actions updating emotional state lyotard 
action hap hap tok goal directed reactive action engine 
continuously chooses agent action perception current goals emotional state behavioral features aspects internal state 
goals hap contain atomic name set parameters instantiated goal active example goto object 
goals characterize world states accomplish hap explicit planning 
sets actions reasons call plans chosen unchanging plan memory may contain plans goal 
plans ordered unordered collections subgoals actions accomplish invoking goal 
example plan goto goal sequence goto floor current room goto room room containing object goto object room object 
plans testable preconditions true plan apply current state world 
multiple plans written goal hap choosing plans execution time 
plan fails hap attempt alternate plans goal perform kind backtracking search real world 
hap stores active goals plans structure called active plan tree apt 
tree alternating layers goals plans represents hap current execution state 
apt may thought tree goals nodes plans nodes 
apt expands contracts goals plans succeed fail 
various annotations apt support reactivity management multiple top level goals 
important annotations context conditions success tests 
arbitrary testable expressions perceived state world aspects internal state 
success tests associated goal apt 
success test true associated goal deemed accomplished longer needs pursued 
example lyotard step goto plan described success test associated determine agent floor room 
success test may allow lyotard skip subgoal 
lyotard process going floor external factor human causes arrive floor subgoal completes success test enable recognize goal succeeded pursuing 
similarly context conditions associated plans active plan tree 
context condition false associated plan deemed longer applicable current state world 
plan fails new plan chosen accomplish invoking goal 
goto plan appropriate context condition object goto goal appear remain reachable 
context condition failed lyotard try plans going target including finding human help 
shows concrete expression small plan includes annotations 
instance goal priority number choosing goal execute importance number em considering significance goal 
annotations assigned instances goals types goals identical goals different priority emotional importance depending context arise 
lyotard going kitchen get food higher priority going kitchen pursuit exploration goal 
sense data processed hap begins execution modifying apt changes world

example hap plan lyotard additional organizing principles help guide style programming hap 
lyotard cluster related goals plans conceptual structures call behaviors 
behavior represents recognizable internally coherent unit action 
behaviors usually activated single goal created pursuit goal top level demon 
mentioned earlier lyotard behaviors shown 
example behavior wanting pet represents plans finding person leg relaxing comfortable place expectation human sense lyotard desire pet 
behavior active lyotard displays coherent action 
section provides examples additional behaviors 
emotion social relationships em em models emotional certain social aspects agent 
ideas ortony 
em develops emotions cognitive base external events compared goals actions compared standards objects including agents compared attitudes 
em possible emotions shown 
subset em necessary implementing lyotard 
limited initial implementation convey full capabilities underlying theory 
detailed description em see :10.1.1.45.8504
hap runs goals created goals succeed goals fail 
events occur hap informs em em uses information generate emotions 
happiness sadness occur agent goals succeed fail 
degree happiness sadness depends importance goal agent provided agent builder 
lyotard feels greater degree happiness satisfies active eating goal satisfies active relaxation goal labeled important 
goals generate emotional reactions 
lyotard goals importance zero produce effect emotion 
addition thresholds em generally prevent low importance goals affecting emotional state 
low importance effects occur emotional state change 
hope fear occur em believes chance active goal succeeding failing 
example lyotard feels hope sees human feed 
amount hope fear determined function goal importance believed likelihood success failure 
pride shame reproach admiration arise action approved 
judgments agent standards represent moral beliefs personal standards performance 
pride shame occur agent performs action admiration reproach develop response actions 
lyotard uses primitive standards cause goals fail help goals succeed feel reproach agent soft chair causes failure relaxation goal 
anger gratitude gratification arise combinations emotions 
agent lyotard chair causes reproach agent causes sadness lyotard due failure lyotard relaxation goal 
sadness reproach combine produce composite emotion anger agent 
similarly gratitude composite happiness admiration sadness shame gratification happiness pride 
choice standards lyotard means reproach anger coexist 
true emotion pairs admiration gratitude shame reproach 
consequence simple standards chose modelling cat emotions 
modelling complicated agents realistic cats standards correspondingly complicated 
em designed handle standards capability lyotard 
em final emotions love hate arise noticing objects agent positive negative attitudes 
lyotard attitudes help model human cat social relationship 
lyotard initially dislikes user negative attitude attitude varies user things lyotard angry grateful 
attitude changes degree emotion love hate human nearby 
emotions attitudes fade time em models decay 
agent feel love close liked 
fade agent leaves attitude agent remain relatively stable 
behavioral features behavioral features modulate activity hap 
adjusted hap em vary ways hap achieves goals
