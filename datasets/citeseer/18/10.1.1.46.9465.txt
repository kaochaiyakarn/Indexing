shown goal lead precisely understand principles drama modeling interesting pure theoretical aim 
method section theoretical theories related narrative drama shortly exposed 
studies appeared useful build model 
study key concept highlighted 
model proposed relies theories drama narrative 
model intend model narrative general introducing narrative concepts just supporting model 
model just stemming narrative concepts 
model discussed various point view 
obviously experimental results follow near advanced stated 
theoretical grounding intelligent characters versus narrative functions years ago vladimir propp analyzed russian tales constructed canonical form tale successive functions absence 
propp 
fact constitutes model narrative notion function determinant interactive drama function character action defined intrigue viewpoint 
apparently simple idea means choice put put function inside story governed causality story character events occurred causality narrative character necessary plot 
example hero leaves home function caused wicked function necessary development narrative narratives journey obstacles 
propp notion function gives interesting light current trend intelligent characters necessary put ai characters blumberg interactive drama characters strongly influence narrative decide narrative 
accomplishing propp functions psychologically motivated actions 
right place ai interactive drama character narrator 
stated aristotle characters need plausible 
practical approach ai levels characters narration designer careful waste time put intelligence character decision act matter narrative 
principle character actions motivated narrative constraints emotional psychological social reasoning 
story generation claude extended propp study functions proposing richer precise model stories 
goal surprisingly close tries answer question possible describe complete network choices logically narrator point narrative continue started story 
breaks story succession processes process centered task divided steps possibility acting completion 
example process modification applied patient opposed agent patient assigned state possibly affected modification state patient maintained original state absence acting modifying process patient maintained original state completion modifying process patient subject process tending modify state patient assigned state non achievement modifying process dozens different processes 
goal integrate model far complex keep idea process divided parts 
principle story broken succession generic processes 
conflict notion conflict described main mechanism drama parent 
generally speaking conflict occurs possible action character compatible values solitary boy conquer girl lady tell love poor servant reader textbook find examples plays movies centered main conflict 
classical structure play acts seen consequence wish exhibit conflict act aimed state situation characters especially values hero 
occurs event trigger action forcing hero second act develop conflict showing hero act act values 
irreversible choice hero lead final act 
irreversible choice understood way solve conflict tragedy conflict winning satisfying solution hero commits suicide gives goal tragedy comedy happy resolution called ex 
conflict important drama certainly allows audience identify hero real life full conflicts 
claim simplifying assumption notion conflict primary 
consider sequential description narrative functions propp acts play twelve steps campbell model campbell vogler conflict descriptions 
note approach takes conflict key element making interactive drama 
principle conflict core dramatic narrative 
pragmatics narrative researchers largely improved understanding narrative tended consider narrative autonomous entity narrative suppose narrator audience adam 
situation similar dialog speaker performs utterance hearer order convey message 
narrative designed receiver close emitter oral dialog 
approach matter pragmatics narrative considered medium act 
influence coded inside narrative 
explicitly example french la fontaine le li vre la hare turtle includes sentence ne de il partir point means better start time run 
usually message contained story narrative contains transformation initial state final state stated propp 
considering transformation result conflict solved message narrative demonstrate possible goal value important conversely value bad necessarily leads failure 
investigate understand links structure narrative precise message conveyed approximation consider principle narrative assumes intention author user intention supposed lie conflict solved 
user model author writes novel screen play imagines audience reader writes narrative supposes audience reader 
described eco narrative contain complete information describing story contrary contains things reader charge reconstructing story pieces 
reading infinitely boring 
just giving partial information author presuppose reader able reconstruct meaning doing needs eco calls reader model 
straightforward extend term user model known human computer interaction 
movie makers familiar technique ellipsis consist letting audience guess happening shot scenes showing durand 
forms narrative called non interactive designed audience remains constantly active guessing said said 
principle narrative author implicitly user model manage user reaction narrative 
model general architecture model computer model interactive drama parameterized writer user interact computer build story time different depending actions 
general architecture model comprises components see world story contains state world currently described story 
ai language typically base facts 
world initialized start narrative specifications author 
temporal evolution story 
narrative logic contains rules world story evolve 
typically give action set action possible 
coded generic rules coming narrative theory 
narrator decides action proposed user filtering suggested narrative logic 
actions just executed proposed user form choice list traditional adventure games 
narrator listen user modify world story decide tell action 
user model narrator choose action belief user 
model contains kinds variables user features adapted user remain static implementations dynamic variables updated action 
theatre manages interaction user display actions capture user actions 
graphics located part real time system example load components choose camera angles user model narrator world story theatre user fig 
architecture narrative logic components correspond qn object object oriented system 
means ideally component exchanged easily 
despite apparent generality architecture presupposes assumptions user interacts choosing actions classical type interaction advantage compared existing interactive drama 
furthermore appeared easiest way interact story display separate story construction action decided displayed 
choice motivated search simplicity 
story engine core model 
principle described model focuses putting stage conflict 
narrative needs protagonist possibly characters 
protagonist characters simpler contains basic units goal practical state character wants reach obstacle practical element world story impossible task directly leads goal tasks alternative tasks character accomplish reach goal values psychological social features tasks evaluated positively negatively 
protagonist seeks reach goal meets obstacle force character find task 
conflict occurs precisely task badly evaluated character values 
character torn need reach goal values 
conflict drama organized successive parts character hears possibility tasks influenced decides refuses character performs tasks need actions succeed fail consequences task drawn 
task succeed narrative falls cases value accepted protagonist consequently changing type typical comedy task rejected protagonist completely broken leads various tragic 
lies intention author showing value bad conversely violated 
general overview generated story various actions followed 
define protagonist task 
different actions able induced task implying character possibly characters inspired propp functions propp processes narrative transformations propose actions information influences decisions acts consequences inform informs perform perform accept accepts perform refuse refuses perform perform performs obstruct transform break changes value blocking breaks value violated note action exist means breaks leads impossibility live normally 
set actions considered general stems narrative theorists studied large amount narratives 
totally rigid certain kind story author may need additional actions need 
example possible add actions decisions group representing gradual process decision making 
acts group detailed representing tasks subtasks success failure 
actions applied causes modification state characters involved action 
state represented set predicates able perform know knows want wants perform begun perform finish succeeded performing ed actions performed rules containing set preconditions action 
example rule know know inform means character able perform task know knows task forbidden values inform possibility perform note state evaluated character values 
important understand rules part narrative logic module described triggered way classical rule systems rules precondition true retrieved fired post conditions applied transmitted narrator 
narrator user rule calculate consequence 
virtual narrator narrator choose possible actions proposed narrative logic 
uses user model contain information psychological state user 
approach similar psychological emotional impact user taken account structure action 
short term try manage user tension avoiding concentrate strong actions short period time example 
implies mark actions dramatic intensity 
sophisticated model managing precisely user knows ignore way suspense example finely tuned 
visual display version system display minimalist textual description actions shown 
reason choose basic solution choosing way representing action determining dangerous 
quite na try reproduce current movie techniques current video games try realistic visualization improving fast limited case interactive systems second modeling movie making process centering particular huge amount third importantly avoid reproduce works kind art 
multimedia art just long way go understands works 
precise technique visualization ways represent action represent course action consequence efficient durand 
chosen represent ellipsis process enforce dramatic intensity 
role user architecture ways user intervene narrative 
particular questions answered user control character 
user totally control character 
user ubiquitous able see various places time story 
suitable answer questions straightforward need understand higher level role user 
pragmatic approach narrative see principle traditional narrative dialog difference hearer answer immediately 
interactive drama user able answer 
suitable interaction scheme interactive drama argumentative dialog author parameterization program user discuss 
user wants hero reach assigned goal author wants show conflict tasks bad 
fight author user transposed inside story user able control actions characters easy boring playing chess oneself interesting control opposite forces 
push follow constraint user controls character protagonist 
may trick alleviate constraint user gaming context certain number points controlling protagonist cost point controlling friends cost points controlling opponent cost lot points 
way control user forces world story allowed limited 
problems remains author assigns values protagonist protagonist controlled user may different values user force protagonist act nature 
solution adapt character user learning mechanisms protagonist similar user 
attractive solution remains difficult settle discarded short term 
second solution consists giving autonomy character portugal 
way balance autonomy control quite problematic solution currently known problem 
third solution consists letting user control protagonist narrator stratagems convey author intention 
example user decides soon perform task narrator naturally insert actions sympathetic characters strongly protagonist perform task 
obviously approach needs experimentation tuning 
script allows navigating inside physical places reasonable allow certain conditions user look distant places 
necessary may reproduce fundamental principle movies audience know protagonist 
technical point view reports progress architecture currently implemented java 
version system necessary test validity assumptions terms user experience gameplay say 
version implemented parts updated sophisticated solutions 
particular story engine uses basic logic pure forward approach 
classical narrative designed author starting interesting rules backward rules triggered want story pass stage 
author point view analyzing dissecting artificially narrative approach may creative process writer 
fact writer creativity just shifted sequential writing underlying forces producing narrative 
really new writing process thinks general theme builds main characters designs conflicts constructs linear succession scenes 
stage necessary creation script interactive drama 
author design conflicts wants exhibit choose main conflict define characters values 
process experienced progressively refined may formalized took years define process making script movie part method interactive drama writing 
user point view user going feel interacting drama 
expecting combine phenomenon identification protagonist especially classical drama feeling immersion involvement proper interactive experience video games 
obvious combination feasible identification effect wiped possibility interaction involvement games disappear soon reflex action involved notice adventure games involving pure action games 
lies challenge explore new form art computer offering 
realize art vain worth contribution 
narrative point view model drama proposed means build interactive drama system 
modeling process worth 
model help better understand drama 
believe answer positive 
example notion conflict fuzzy ambiguous 
model conflict clear concept situation task negatively evaluated character values 
similarly clear distinction mechanisms provide possible stories world story narrative logic responsible narration narrator user model theatre valuable understand different components drama 
disciplines effort modeling reducing simplifying help clarifying understanding concepts
