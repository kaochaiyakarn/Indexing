data extraction issues aligning parallel texts word phrase levels just begun existing results area quite promising 
probably improvement experienced gained 
existing systems exploit number different knowledge sources heuristics far explored systematically 
phrase extraction tools taggers partial parsers developed applied bitexts current systems show higher performance 
close analyses alignment results probably result better understanding translation process type correspondences current systems 
exist number challenging tasks investigated 
concern generation complex translation data contrastive valency data transfer rules machine translation systems 
line research seeks develop methods adapting existing general knowledge source bilingual multilingual dictionary domain text type 
evaluation far generally agreed methods evaluating software processing parallel texts 
researchers report results parallel texts available usually texts researchers available measures tend vary group
