describing content page web pages intended human readable common conventions structuring html pages 
instance information page exhibits hierarchical structure furthermore semistructured information form lists tuples explicit separators distinguish different elements 
observations mind developed embedded catalog ec formalism describe structure wide range semistructured documents 
ec description page tree structure leaves items interest user represent relevant data 
internal nodes ec tree represent lists tuples lists restaurant descriptions item tuple leaf list case called embedded list 
instance displays ec descriptions la weekly pages 
top level la weekly page list tuples contain name address phone review embedded list credit cards 
similarly document seen tuple includes list addresses la weekly restaurant descriptions name address phone review credit card list la weekly document list restaurant document name food service cost list addresses review street city area code phone number ec description la weekly pages

extracting data document ec description document extraction rule attached edge list iteration rule associated list node wrapper extract item interest leaf simply determining path root corresponding leaf successively extracting node parent order extract wrapper applies extraction rule attached edge list node wrapper apply iteration rule decomposes individual tuples applies extracted tuple 
framework document sequence tokens st words numbers html tags 
follows content root node ec tree sequence st content children subsequence st generally content arbitrary node represents subsequence content parent key idea underlying extraction rules landmarks groups consecutive tokens enable wrapper agent locate content content instance consider restaurant descriptions 
order identify restaurant name rule skipto meaning start document skip find landmark 
formally rule applied content node parent particular case document effect applying consists consuming prefix parent ends restaurant name 
similarly identify node content applying rule consumes corresponding suffix parent 
instance order find restaurant name apply rule skipto document 
rules called start rules cases unique 
instance replace skipto name skipto skipto name symbol meaning ignore find name landmark ignore find interpreted ignore tokens find token landmark consists token name immediately followed punctuation sign html tag 
rules successfully identify start restaurant name say match correctly

example names recommended restaurants appear bold ones displayed italic extract names disjunctive start rules skipto skipto skipto skipto cuisine skipto disjunctive rule matches disjuncts matches 
case disjuncts match nondeterministically choose matching disjuncts 
illustrate extraction process works list members lets consider case wrapper agent extract area codes sample document 
case agent starts extracting entire list addresses done start rule skipto rule skipto 
wrapper iterate content list addresses lines break individual tuples 
order find start individual address agent repeatedly applies skipto content list successive rule matching starts point previous ended 
similarly agent determines tuple repeatedly applying rule skipto 
example list iteration process leads creation individual addresses contents showed lines respectively 
wrapper applies address area code start rule skipto skipto respectively 
assume area codes wrapper extract zip codes
