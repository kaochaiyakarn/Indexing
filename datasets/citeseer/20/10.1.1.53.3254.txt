firstly similarities object oriented paradigm agentoriented paradigm :10.1.1.27.9180
early times distributed artificial intelligence dai close relationship dai object concurrent programming established 
stated shoham agents considered active objects objects mental state 
paradigms message passing communicating inheritance aggregation defining architecture 
main difference constrained type messages ao paradigm definition state agent beliefs desires intentions commitments possible advantage comes commonly usage object oriented languages implement agent systems considered natural framework 
popularity object oriented methodologies potential advantage 
object oriented methodologies industry success object modelling technique omt object oriented software engineering oose object oriented design rdd responsibility driving design unified modelling language uml 
experience key facilitate integration agent technology hand software engineers reluctant learn complete new methodology hand managers prefer follow methodologies successfully tested
