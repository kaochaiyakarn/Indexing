baldwin effect universal relationship evolution learning strength effect sensitive shape fitness landscape 
immune system clonal selection human immune system responsible recognizing defending pathogens foreign molecules collectively called antigens 
immune system produces special molecules antibodies bind antigen lead elimination 
antigen recognition essentially form template matching shape charge antibody antigen molecules match complementary fashion molecules bind antigen recognized 
closer match antibody antigen stronger molecular binding better recognition 
antibodies produced cells immune system 
cell produces specific type antibody recognize specific types antigen 
antibodies produced cell expressed surface cell receptors 
antibody receptors cell recognize antigen cell stimulated reproduce 
presence antigen daughter cells stimulated cell stimulated reproduce 
presence antigen cause proliferation cells best suited recognizing antigen 
process called clonal selection 
stimulated proliferation cells activates mechanism called somatic 
somatic affects genes encode antibody molecule particular portion antibody binds antigen called variable region 
daughter cells stimulated cell exhibit wide variation ability recognize antigen 
due competition binding antigen better cells higher affinity antibodies stimulated antigen grow expense cells expressing poorer lower affinity antibodies 
repeating process mutation selection number times immune system learns produce higher affinity antibodies antigen stimulating system learned characteristics immune system passed directly offspring
