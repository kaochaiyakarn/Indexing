problem question time presentation higher dimensional automata hda pra boris trakhtenbrot asked relationship hda event structures 
despite having addressed issue section focusing persistence conflict answer question conflict persisted solution struck late year 
general problem reconcile respective motivating intuitions supporting formalisms underlying event geometry approaches concurrency 
event structures replace traditional state view computation view set fa bg representing events unconstrained order 
contrast geometry approach retains state view models evident state square automaton accepting ab ba square interior filled dimensional surface representing overlapped execution supported onr number precisely asked relationship event spaces pra distinction negligible compared difference hda 
question understood simply notion concurrent computation seen compatible perspectives inconsistency preventing models concurrency 
main reasons pursuing trakhtenbrot question 
hda event structures attractive models concurrency raising question respective intuitions nature concurrency compatible 
second hda event structures draw complementary areas mathematics hda vg gj gc gou gun gou gou gou gou bj sc tak drawn methods algebraic topology particular homotopy homology event structures tend depend methods domain theory logic especially involving duality 
intrinsically interesting principle important practice concurrent programming language design understand notion concurrency shift emphasis way substantially different areas mathematics 
essential differences hda event structures 
basic differences involve conflict duality 
hda express persistent transient conflict event structures cater better schedule automaton duality 
persistent conflict notated binary case means happen 
transient conflict mutual exclusion means precludes binary case temporarily executing 
hda express kinds conflict equally directly event structures express persistent conflict directly deal transient conflict 
unlabeled event structure events express persistent conflict directly design 
express mutex rendered ab ba unlabeled events requires labeled events labeled labeled events ab persistent conflict ba 
hda better expressing concept simply omitting interior square 
hand event structures dualize easily acyclic automata families configurations called event structure literature 
dualization accomplished simply configurations sets events satisfying constraints defining event structure 
identifying sets events characteristic functions dualization understood object set general hom gamma usual notion representable contravariant functor 
contrast hda typically defined obvious dualization higher dimensional schedules plausible notion schedule 
transient conflict schedule automaton duality important neglect 
transient conflicts various kinds theory concurrency control databases pap 
overly restrictive limit representation computation just automata states connected transitions schedules events separated temporal constraints features interest computational process seen clearly schedule automaton just physical interactions seen best terms waves particles depending circumstances sharp boundary crossover

hda useful geometric structure form supports process algebra better competing hda model 
event structures usual passage families configurations works essentially way configurations represented fuzzy sets events having degrees membership ordinary fuzzy sets

interest particular quantale corresponding intuitions underlying hda 
geometry take set dimensions consists functions jaj geometry solid cube 
dimensional interior constant tuple 
gamma dimensional faces tuples exactly components 
generally tuple called cell dimension number 
cell dimension called cell 
replacing occurrence cell turns cell immediate faces gamma cell

join semilattice structure extends pointwise adjoining fictitious face bottom completes complete semilattice complete general distributive lattice called face lattice 
equivalently form distributive lattice equipping bottom form distributive lattice identify smash tuples containing bottom destroys distributivity 
analog singular homology skip smashing step yielding better behaved face lattice 
hda interpretation cube concurrent process having events interprets cells cube possible states automaton 
state function indicates progress event means respectively started running finished 
having established basic geometry solid cube turn general shapes 
directions characterizable cubical complexes constraints 
cubical complex set cubes various dimensions sharing faces give set nontrivial connectivity possibly containing cycles 
constraint approach simply imposes constraints cube possibly infinite interpreted forbidding certain faces including likelihood interior 
cycles arise 
standard approach algebraic topology 
cubical complexes attractive definition presheaves functors set category ffi objects cubes large required infinite uncountable desired morphisms embeddings smaller cubes faces larger ones 
describing simpler describe ffi especially simple description category sets sets equipped constants preserved homomorphisms
