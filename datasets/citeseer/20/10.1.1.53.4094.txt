add speech interface virtual reality applications 
speech interfaces increasingly command control applications interactive information services 
example simple baggage handling application operator states destination baggage system routes appropriate aircraft 
complex systems telephone services flight train timetable information user provides travel parameters system attempts retrieve appropriate information application database eckert mcglashan mcglashan 
speech interfaces types application share features restricted language system capable understanding general natural language language appropriate particular task 
users required limited vocabulary grammar successful interactions system 
feedback system reports user states goals order system behaviour transparent possible 
system may confirm information understood give explanation understand user utterance example user spoke quietly 
interactive applications distinguished command control applications complexity task domain corresponding increase complexity language 
system typically plays role operative agent dialogue human service agent system responsibility ensure dialogue proceeds smoothly 
system responsible may know task domain user may source problems dialogue speech recognition language interpretation errors 
consequently system follow strategies navigation initiative asking questions obtain information provided user necessary complete task strategies detecting repairing problems dialogue 
fact operative interactive speech systems seen instances indirect management interface kay interface user delegates task computer agent initiates monitors actions order solve task 
contrast conventional interfaces virtual reality direct manipulation primary characteristics 
manipulation carried physical actions 

objects manipulated persistent 

actions rapid reversible effect objects immediately visible 
talking agents virtual worlds case virtual reality users perceive objects virtual world means stereoscopic display 
macintosh windows interfaces actions effected objects selecting commands menus keyboard sequences mouse operations 
example user navigate world cursor keys select objects clicking apply actions selected object choosing operation menu 
range objects actions available user explicit user responsibility explicitly initiating monitoring actions ensure desired effect achieved 
combining speech interface direct manipulation interface results multimodal interface users act world issuing physical speech commands conversely system respond speaking making changes virtual world 
speech offers obvious benefits compared direct manipulation interface 
benefit speech offers way issuing commands allowing hands eyes remain free 
operations normally carried direct manipulation modality transportation change view object creation deletion effected tying modality 
multiple actions simultaneously carried different modalities 
particularly useful cases hands eyes busy tasks need dealt time time example direct manipulation drive car speech control radio car phone board systems 
alternatively user combine actions achieve synergy effects example clicking object simultaneously speaking action performed object 
second benefit users refer objects current view virtual world direct manipulation interface actions applied objects visually 
users speech select manipulate objects visual focus town entered visual focus town simply known objects home town objects set towns driven high level actions 
course obvious benefit speech naturalness precisely familiarity 
users familiar language act world 
just virtual worlds necessarily obey conventions physical world standard conventions language necessarily apply interacting machines 
benefit speech needs tempered restricted language system recognise understand user familiarity direct manipulation carry task 
example user may familiar simply prefer direct manipulation self transportation 
furthermore speech commands actions natural everyday world normally simply carry appropriate physical actions say legs move bar 
situations action naturally carried language example physically handicapped person may rely helper move wheelchair 
extrapolating type situation users may find natural spoken commands certain classes action virtual world addressing agent specialised actions 
return idea section 
multimodal interface combining speech direct manipulation provide efficient interaction single modality interface allow access benefits modalities 
allow modality compensate limitations 
example direct manipulation interface compensate limitations speech making immediately visible effects actions objects indicating display objects extension actions currently salient system 
addition user free decide modality actions example users may direct manipulation transportation virtual world speech modality manipulating objects 
motivation choice modality frequently various factors apart personal preference important including naturalness action modality issuing spoken commands move oneself counter intuitive difficulty complexity carrying action modality sequence menu selection mouse clicking required manipulate object 
empirical studies suggested users prefer interact reduce errors task completion time compared single modality interface oviatt 
talking agents virtual worlds issues speech language interaction order develop multimodal interface virtual environments issues need dealt accurately recognising user said identifying user talking discourse context designing dialogue partner facilitates restricted language 
speech recognition speech may natural modality acting everyday world difficult model computer system direct manipulation 
features contribute difficulty speech recognition shown table mcglashan 
feature increasing difficulty utterance isolated continuous mode read spontaneous training speaker dependent speaker independent vocabulary tens hundreds language restricted unrestricted table features speech recognisers interactive speech applications require recognition continuous spontaneous speech isolated speech arises words separated silences typically dictation systems 
continuous speech acoustic signal lacks natural sub divisions equivalent words 
difficulty segmenting signal individual words compounded variation pronunciation different linguistic contexts spoken speaker 
spontaneous speech introduces naturally occurring phenomena including extra linguistic phenomena blows lip filled pauses example paint house red re starts speaker reiterates part utterance interruption take hou red house 
difficulties addressed system trained individual users practical public services users known advance tolerate training phase 
techniques speaker independent continuous speech recognition developed point recognition accuracy suitable real world applications albeit restricted language 
particular finite state grammar approaches model relevant acoustic information pre defined phrases provide recognition performance 
past current performance recognition technique improve vocabulary sizes years shown 
systems large recognition vocabulary defined separate grammars appropriate different stages interaction example grammar opening dialogue obtaining time information obtaining location information 
leads accurate recognition phases example system mis interpret paint red pain tit red phrase part active grammar 
may limit linguistic capability system offer advantage subsequent level analysis restricted scope syntactic semantic pragmatic analysis need handle phenomena handled speech recogniser 
restricted language natural consequence talking machines natural part everyday activities focused particular task zoltan ford 
command control applications interactive dialogue applications user input different stages dialogue accurately predicted promising areas high accuracy speech recognition restricted language 
talking agents virtual worlds year continuous speech recognition performance language understanding order determine effects user utterances virtual world output speech recogniser analysed identify object user referring action want apply object 
shall restrict object descriptions action descriptions treated analogous manner 
linguistic expressions usually characterised referring discourse objects 
discourse objects part discourse model represents participants understanding evolving discourse 
level description intermediate linguistic graphical level description levels objects everyday virtual world 
way distinction motivated grounds different types processes appropriate different levels description 
applying referential resolution processes discourse model ensures interpretation specific understood participants allows interpretation goal directed 
linguistic expressions total partial descriptions discourse objects total description describes properties discourse object refers unique object discourse model partial description describes properties object 
partial descriptions anaphoric elliptical expressions significantly common spoken dialogue discourse participants tend produce fragmentary utterances full sentences participants required draw shared contextual domain linguistic knowledge resolution 
example user wants paint house red user say paint house red paint building red paint large object red just paint red 
understanding user utterances context system required knowledge houses related buildings buildings large objects expressions refer house 
deictic expression talking agents virtual worlds indicates descriptions ambiguous contextual information impossible know refers house 
knowledge required resolution divided ontological linguistic contextual knowledge 
ontological knowledge covers general knowledge domain specific knowledge 
knowledge described terms typed object inheritance hierarchy object described terms properties roles objects principally related means specialisation objects organised general top hierarchy specific ones bottom objects inherit roles properties objects hierarchy 
example house object specialisation building turn specialisation thing linguistic expressions characterised instances objects inheritance hierarchy linguistic specific information concerning features definiteness definite versus indefinite noun phrases polarity positive negative descriptions 
linguistic information guide search possible referents discourse model 
example definite expressions house indicates discourse object instantiated current discourse model 
instantiation may arise previous explicit linguistic graphical expression presupposition talk rooms house houses presupposed rooms 
ontological linguistic knowledge sufficient resolution may dependent object linguistic graphical modalities salient context 
discourse model objects ordered terms saliency yield focus discourse grosz 
example previous utterance create house referent paint red resolved discourse object house assuming salient object 
computer systems lack detailed ontological linguistic knowledge human participants tracking focus discourse essential technique resolution speech interfaces 
interaction metaphor third central issue developing speech interface virtual worlds nature relationship system user 
interactive dialogue systems role system clear simulation human agent information service user expect similar albeit limited behaviour system 
direct manipulation interfaces virtual reality basic metaphor personal presence user embodied actor world provided perspective world 
metaphor clearly applicable spoken interaction obvious dialogue partner 
various metaphors spoken interaction proposed proxy user take control various agents virtual world interacts virtual world example painter paint house red 
user acts god controls world directly example house red
