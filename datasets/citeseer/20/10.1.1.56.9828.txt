digital credentials world wide web winslett ching jones department computer science university illinois urbana champaign west springfield avenue urbana il usa phone email ching cs uiuc edu information source web provide different classes service different clients 
autonomous highly distributed world web traditional approach authentication differentiate classes clients longer sufficient knowledge client identity suffice determine client authorized service 
goal research project explore digital credentials digital analogues credentials carry wallets today help solve problem 
describe major features required web environment deploying digital credentials including security assistants clients servers report status investigation credential environment 
internet information sources provide different classes service different users 
example services available residents texas minors 
client prove information source eligible service 
traditionally thought authentication facilities provide answer problem 
authentication allows service verify identity client internet startup companies focused authentication facilities web 
knowing identity client ensure client live texas fact client exact identity irrelevant cases client reluctant divulge identity privacy reasons 
option require potential clients service 
runs counter spirit web services clients enter small service request spur moment 
mandatory reduce potential client base service 
example time officers acm sigmod wished restrict line version sigmod record members sigmod able read articles record 
carry 
current browser technology allow record web site store list names passwords sigmod members 
huge administrative headache volunteer administrators record site 
difficult obtain date line lists sigmod members acm 
easy way inform sigmod members passwords 
changes membership passwords term client refer human controlling web browser browser 
additional burden 
addition computer powering site small low disk space owners object presence large files administrative information 
additional drawback supplying site exact name time came browse sigmod member information really relevant site access control decision important fact visitor member sigmod visitor exact identity 
privacy point view visitor need prove sigmod membership identity 
visitor record site mind identity sites web visitor advised cautious 
site choose sell visitor identity details visitor actions site marketing database companies 
additional legal restrictions currently place way prevent server seen digital credential sharing information contained 
annoyance receiving marketing information visitors reason wish keep visit private example visitor searching information serious disease want potential employers suspect visitor disease 
potential solution privacy problem reach current browser technology shared name password sigmod member 
provide little protection information site members sigmod able gain access repercussions sharing sigmod password 
shared passwords passwords notoriously ineffective preventing unauthorized access avoided information site truly sensitive 
modern technology provides solution problem ssl authentication facilities built sigmod members browsers 
approach browser transparently prove site visitor possesses certain browser specific identity 
addition ssl authentication approach provide security simple passwords 
unfortunately identity browser known identity visitor known sigmod 
fact visitor identity different different browser visitor uses 
approach require possibly insecure line line step incur administrative headaches keeping track relationship members browsers 
visitor divulge browser identity point view irrelevant making access control decision may raise privacy concerns 
smart cards common decade allow user carry identity user moves browser browser alleviate privacy concerns discussed 
overcome problems investigating digital credentials may thought line analogues credentials people carry wallets 
example digital version acm sigmod membership card gain access record line 
credentials issued typically line kinds authorities issue credentials today voter registrars driver license facilities schools employers hospitals credentials submitted request service prove client particular properties required service provider clients 
modern encryption technology digital credentials unforgeable verifiable manner today pkcs certificates newly introduced certificate product com 
example acm digitally sign credential says certain acm member identified membership number belongs acm 
careful design user interface client control credentials shown having attach relevant credentials manually service request 
digital credentials brings host new data management problems 
applications running web servers embodied cgi scripts brevity refer applications scripts servers policies credentials required services 
real world policies quite complex raising information management issues 
example simple sigmod record site probably choose different levels access sigmod members acm members joint ieee acm members general public 
addition servers means communicating policies clients clients obtain attach appropriate credentials requests 
clients able understand policies choose credentials best suited current request clients general unwilling show credentials just server 
example user able tell browser attach acm sigmod membership credential request sent sigmod record web site send request 
perform tasks clients servers need automated assistance 
research project cs uiuc edu security focusing design development personal security assistant clients server security assistant servers 
personal security assistant central task personal security assistant psa manage client credentials accordance stated policies client 
psa helps client obtain credentials stores locally attaches service requests accordance policies established client determines credentials needed particular service request communicates needed client carrying assigned tasks 
example consider case acm credentials 
acm credential includes name issuing organization acm identity credential owner known acm membership number class membership voting student joint institutional expiration date common name owner sue smith 
consider digital version acm credential includes exactly information 
credential digitally signed acm making unforgeable verifiable obtain acm public key trusted source decrypt credential verify contents uncorrupted message digest standard techniques conclude credential issued entity knew acm private key presumably known acm 
credential contents identity membership class arranged standard format description available request acm self describing data structure way contents machine parsable server receiving credential able determine certain identity member acm 
digital version acm credential need exactly mimic credential contents 
example digital version omit common name bearer 
common name credentials largely reasons humans identified numbers prejudice shared computers common name allows bearer prove individual mentioned credential 
example sue show acm membership card id bearing common name photo example signature 
sue proves identity mentioned acm credential showing face reproducing signature 
common name need authentication digital credentials acm associate public private key pair membership number public keys available including issued credentials 
sue prove person mentioned digital acm credential proving knowledge private key associated acm credential standard authentication techniques 
acm credential need identify local name meaningful context acm 
greatly enhances potential privacy digital credentials servers need learn name clients widely known common name social security number 
server shown credentials identifying client different identities server learn client possesses identities fact eventually reach exact identity client 
ease local names digital credentials provide absolute privacy guarantees 
mentioned earlier server received parsed sue acm credential prevents server contents credential 
reduce risk risks doing business web sue choose show credentials servers possess certain credentials akin better business bureau stamp approval 
approach lessen chance sue interacting server claims fake acm sigmod site developed purpose collecting identities acm members 
possibility discussed machinery develop case clients presenting credentials servers relevant reverse scenario servers attempt woo clients presenting credentials potential clients 
shows flow example request psa server security assistant 
servers tend central resources tasks associated managing digital credentials offloaded clients possible 
means clients assistants responsible obtaining appropriate credentials particular request submitting server request psa store credentials locally 
example sue psa may assist task obtaining acm credential acm credential issuer located line may attractive target attack 
case issued acm credential associated information passwords private keys credential data format credential signature algorithm stored psa exhibited servers sue gives permission 
help reason credentials client possesses services client eligible psa translates contents newly acquired credentials internal format stores translations local knowledge base 
psa know shallow sense word sue credential issued acm certain membership number certain expiration date 
psa knowledge base tend grow time expired credentials may needed certain purposes 
example irs may challenge sue prove really acm member year took deduction professional dues tax return 
psa able determine credentials required service request may require extra round communication server carried automatically intervention client 
server explanation policy credentials required offered standard language assistant understand clear semantics psa reason credentials possessed client match server policy way server 
easily accomplished credential contents translated standard language expressing policies standard semantics language 
example approach export policies dialect standard knowledge interchange format kif 
example policy record server may require proof acm sigmod membership clients wish read text record articles 
article abstracts may available acm members sigmod members 
sigmod conference attendees may special privileges viewing june issue record contains conference proceedings 
joint acm ieee members may required prove ieee members accorded privileges normally associated acm membership 
small example record server policy relatively complex psa need able reason just server 
easy policy credential interchange requires conventions representations common categories information example sue psa able determine acm membership class voting psa may understanding membership class means 
recommendations shared ontologies outside scope 
understanding credentials satisfy particular request remains choose set credentials submitted 
compromise ease privacy best approach client give psa policy credential submission 
inconvenient user specify separate policy individual service request policy assign service requests categories 
category policy tells credentials freely distributed explicit permission 
example urls belonging record site may lumped category sue credential submission policy 
may specify acm membership credential sigmod credential attached service request going record site particular request requires credentials 
sue psa obtain copy record credential acceptance policy asks look article psa automatically attach acm sigmod credential request 
asks look full text article psa automatically attach sigmod credential request 
sue goes different site say main acm site requests document acm server policy available acm members sue psa pop dialog box asking permission attach acm credential request giving option turning permission denial permanent part credential submission policy 
server credential acceptance policy describe general terms credentials server willing accept kinds requests spelling exactly client submit current request 
example suppose record server changed policy joint acm ieee members show proof membership gain access record abstracts 
ann psa old policy automatically attach joint acm membership credential request ieee credential 
requesting missing ieee credential server return copy current policy 
psa reason server policy client submission policy set credentials currently hand determine set credentials submitted 
words psa determine ieee credential accompany ann joint acm membership credential check ann permits ieee credential shown record site 
reasoning conducted relatively quickly mentioned human client waiting carried 
server security assistant security related functions server encapsulated server security assistant ssa shown 
server security assistant shares functions psa 
example ssa able reason sets credentials credential acceptance policies 
ssa able export portions credential acceptance policy clients ask explanations server security policy 
addition ssa understanding different services provided server different privileges client possess accessing services 
simplify specification users privileges software systems divide users groups specify privileges group basis 
case web site identity clients known advance cases making imperative describe privileges manner independent client identity 
approach describe privileges associated particular sets credentials client ssa 
descriptions terms explicit sets credentials may lengthy complex convenient ssa policy bundle combinations credentials accord client privileges equivalence class credentials 
ssa policy specify credentials client belong equivalence class es privileges defined equivalence class 
call equivalence classes role 
role indicates capacity client acting response request may different depending role identity client making request 
example accessing american airlines reservation site visitors may classified roles non frequent frequent gold platinum accorded different service frequent status 
sue presents gold frequent status credential american airlines reservation system may allow choose special meal reservation time service available gold platinum 
parsing verifying authenticity translating credentials submitted request ssa match credential information server acceptance policy determine roles client assume current request 
example sue psa submits sigmod membership credential request record site sue assigned role full privileges look site 
psa submits sigmod credential american airlines sue probably classified non frequent sigmod membership accords special privileges american airlines 
intuitively sue sigmod membership qualifies roles record site 
example qualifies role requires credentials general public role 
visitors permitted browse tables contents denied access abstracts full article texts 
client qualifies multiple roles ssa take actions 
policy may specify priority roles example client eligible read full text record treated member general public 
prioritization may guarantee client eligible role 
second psa may requested specific role roles request service help narrow set eligible roles 
third option application may willing accept set roles request service treat client accordingly 
ssa need assign client single role 
application explicit knowledge roles wrapper may need written applies role knowledge appropriately certain database user name password preassigned requests role invoking application certain options 
simple cases may suffice invoke application client role qualified access return error client psa 
example browsing record separate application program web server returns requested documents 
client qualifies role permitted access requested document ssa pass request server 
client qualify ssa pass web server error response intended psa copy relevant policy 
ssa knowledge base describing server credential acceptance policy consists sections 
describes classification requests categories equivalence classes clients categorize service requests simplify policy specification 
requests category share security policy simplifying specification policy 
section knowledge base shows roles suitable kinds requests 
final section describes application policy credentials required roles 
policy spells exactly credential types issuers acceptable role ssa recognize wide variety related credential sets conclude bearer entitled types access pertaining corresponding role 
example mary submits acm membership credential membership class student ssa policy may require prove currently enrolled accredited institution higher learning 
impractical ssa policy list institutions explicitly 
policy require submit current student credential issued say university illinois 
addition policy require mary submit credential issued national authority stating university illinois accredited 
policy need explicitly list acceptable authorities 
ascertain client making request possesses identity mentioned submitted credential server require client authenticate identities mentioned credential 
example sue probably prove really individual acm number listed submitted acm credential 
authentication accomplished current known techniques software ranging primitive insecure approach supplying password modern public private key approaches pem pgp 
credential issuers may refer client different names client may authenticate multiple identities trying credentials 
example ann joint acm ieee membership ssa policy require authenticate acm ieee identity membership number 
facet reasoning credentials involves determining validity dates submitted credentials appropriate request 
simple policies ssa simply determine expiration date credential passed 
complex policies ssa may need deeper understanding notion time reason validity intervals attached statements 
example ssa someday need determine sue member acm ieee time 
imagine policies readily enforceable considering examples involving negation 
example friend authors purchased house sold methodist church 
order carry transaction line client prove identities methodist church 
requirement impractical 
practical example consider service sell guns internet 
law 
foolish way express requirement say client presents credential proving purchase permitted 
client need omit offending credential complete purchase 
sensible treatment negation example require purchaser prove producing appropriate conduct credential local police office done today adoption process 
say negation place credential acceptance policy example sigmod record policy state article abstracts available acm members institutional members 
distinguishing feature case gain access client certain credential negative prohibitions apply certain aspects gun example client omits entirely client denied access 
similarly prohibition may apply certain combination credentials clients texas residents 
psa times need explanation server security policy example access 
ssa send psa copy policy written export language knowledge representation 
policy interest psa furthermore ssa willing share entire policy 
example ssa willing admit existence certain categories service certain roles just 
case ssa planned advance information willing share kinds clients 
example american airlines may version policy give non frequent frequent 
frequent may know meal selection available gold non frequent may learn meal selection service 
client requests explanation ssa deny request wishes return explanation psa ssa credentials attached request determine portion version knowledge base willing share particular client service request 
constraint extracted portion knowledge base partially consistent actual knowledge base sense psa reasons extract determines particular set credentials lead authorization request correct 
client quickly realize ssa security policy unable determine sets credentials submitted 
current research directions focus past year elaboration different functions psa ssa perform described development testbed implementation psa ssa 
testbed prototype implements psa personal proxy ssa cgi script viewed project web site cs uiuc edu security 
publications related digital credentials project available web site 
number research issues remain project address 
primary question scalability design implementation psa 
prototype small application approach especially user interface scaled handle large number documents typical web user may access 
important scalability question relates knowledge base ssa extracts shares psas 
knowledge base constructed modular fashion allow easy extraction 
theoretical requirement impose extracts drawn reasonably correct 
ontology conventions psa sense new server policy 
multiple standard languages policy interchange required 
different servers different inference approaches psas adapt mimic reasoning different manner integrates reasoning 
functionality enhancements needed real deployment digital credentials 
psa better assistant human better ability mimic reasoning ssa improving ability analyze failed requests service recommend actions teaching help credentials allowing client express complex subtle policies credentials sent servers 
design aids offered programmers create 
investigating digital credentials increase possibilities interaction heterogeneous services 
example mediators brokers may available help clients find relevant information sources fuse information derived sources 
broker choice sources recommend client depend security policies sources credentials possessed client 
summarize distill policies 
mediator faces additional challenges may trusted information source client may valuable services client 
untrusted mediator integrated environment client server able digital credentials enter trusted relationship
