relative formance inter extra ortho conditions horizontal vertical asymmetry replicated making weights horizontal components input prototype distance smaller factor weights vertical components equations correspond weighted norm kx gamma gamma gamma weight matrix 
difference weights equivalent having larger tolerance viewpoint shifts horizontal vertical direction learned automatically 
predictions linear combination approach outlined appear glance incompatible experimental results 
specifically recognition linear combination near perfect inter extra conditions poor views ortho plane 
claim ignores likelihood implementation dictated deviations linearity numerical instability extrapolation opposed interpolation possible availability routes recognition certain distinctive relatively viewpoint invariant features parallel terminating segments 
noted allowing factors render linear combination scheme similar view approximation distinction data difficult 
approaches distinguished experimentally comparing generalization novel views obtained hand rigid rotation object hand nonrigid deformation 
discussion performance pattern subjects recognizing novel views incompatible predictions alignment theories employ representations 
possible subjects form representations required alignment theory motion information training stage 
different study training views shown motion stereo yielded similar poor recognition radically novel views 
opportunity form representations subjects performed done 
furthermore performance remained essentially unchanged subjects effectively precluded acquiring representations substituting single static monocular view training sequences 
experiments described carried different object sets belonged basic category thin wire structures 
type object suited studying basics recognition allows isolate pure shape processing factors self occlusion associated aspect structure surface phenomena 
restriction necessarily limits scope ongoing series experiments involve objects confirmed earlier main finding anisotropic generalization novel views counters predictions theories representations 
specifically stimuli yielded significantly higher rate ortho views compared conditions inter extra difference generally pronounced
