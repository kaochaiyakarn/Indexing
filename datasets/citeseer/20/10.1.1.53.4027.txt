adaptive information filtering evolutionary computation kok department computer science leiden university box ra leiden netherlands live termed information age 
called data age relevant data information finding relevant data faster growing heaps available data increasingly difficult 
problem twofold 
amount available data large searching requires advanced algorithms 
field research concerned issue called information retrieval 
secondly amount newly added data growing rapidly processing data requires advanced methods 
field research concerned issue called information filtering 
different ways information filtering employed 
process new data storage information retrieval system provide users personal information delivery system specially tailored personal information needs 
information filtering concerned filtering data streams way leave pertinent data information 
data streams produced changing environment filtering adapt order remain effective 
adaptive information filtering concerned filtering changing environments

important consequences 
fitness trial solution calculated statistically approximated time 
secondly environment changes fitness trial solution may change 
words fitness estimated time probably change time complicating task 
elements population vectors weights 
fitness element time defined dividing score age 
age defined number articles evaluated element population moment 
score number times correctly classified article 
means score larger age results welcome property range fitness values limited interval zero 
value zero member question incorrectly clustered documents processed far member mistake clustering 
fitness function allows fitness members various ages meaningfully compared 
problem fitness function 
explain problem analogy 
imagine teams 
old proven ratio percent games played won games played far new unproven team ratio percent games played far 
clearly proven team reliable new team simply lucky couple times 
reflected fitness function 
solution adopted split population pools new unproven members ages certain value adults 
member pool fitness estimation 
takes time member reached certain age removed pool put pool adults 
view pool waiting room second pool 
fixed number children produced members adult pool 
put directly adult pool wait time fitness estimation reliable 
worked fixed size total population worst adults removed population order add children 
pools children adults vary size combination reduced original population size 
strategy quite question remains connection age distribution population statistical reliability fitness values members 
advanced age certainly indicates high reliability certainly simply reversed 
children slight mutations better performing adults expected general perform quite 
operator mutation 
selection parent mutation implemented follows 
member highest fitness gets chance selected 
selection performed choosing random number zero comparing selective pressure parameter 
smaller current member selected member highest fitness current member process repeated choosing random number zero 
selective pressure parameter set experiments conducted case study
