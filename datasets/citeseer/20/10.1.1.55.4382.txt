finding reminding reconsidered scott fertig eric freeman david gelernter july sigchi bulletin deborah barreau bonnie nardi rightly point computer user spends enormous time effort filing finding electronic files little research subject 
barreau nardi investigated electronic filing finding practices users common desktop systems determine factors affecting individual decisions acquire organize maintain retrieve information 
efforts study basic aspects user computer interaction believe draw wrong research 
goal explain 
studies total subjects dos users windows user os user macintosh users noted similarities users 
preference location search finding files contrast logical text search 
file placement critical reminding function 
types information ephemeral working archived 
lack importance archiving files conclude similarities represent fundamental user practices preferences independent operating system level experience 
believe gives useful categorization user information space previous studies reported consistent findings 
artifacts narrow scope systems studied general statements way users acquire organize maintain retrieve information 
studies focus common desktop metaphor favors certain types interaction 
light reported patterns unsurprising user interfaces macintosh windows os platforms close relatives 
believe doing commenting minor points suggesting fundamental problem analysis analogous concluding radio listeners preferred headphones listening legal look feel reflects fact 
despite fact radios speakers invented 
studying stereo owners concluding lack importance high fidelity systems vast majority people listened poor fidelity record players 
today know people prefer high fidelity 
believe research broaden scope analysis consider just current practice possibilities 
article comment briefly barreau nardi analysis pointing think drawn wrong 
mention systems different non desktop interaction metaphors included studies type 
analysis preference location search barreau nardi describe location search process user takes guess directory folder diskette thinks file located goes location browses list files array icons location till finds file looking 
process iterated needed 
alternative described barreau nardi logical finding text search keywords filenames search files 
functionality provided macintosh find dos utilities studies 
barreau nardi conclude users prefer find files location cues text search approaches 
hypothesize users may prefer location searching actively engages mind body greater sense control 
hypothesize users dislike text search sit waiting computer return list files may may relevant 
barreau nardi filenames purpose jogging memory purpose search 
report users find file couple tries turned find feature search 
note location finding user controlled logical search 
finding user searches file collection relying mnemonic aids memory past events lo cate file 
scheme faults error prone time consuming 
barreau nardi pointed study user find file created mere hours earlier remarked call file 
entirely possible subjects preferred search lesser search methods slow difficult operate file names contents location search may bad 
find hardly state art logical search 
systems provide incremental indexing file contents significantly reduce search time increasing accuracy 
inclusion better search techniques current systems results logical search 
don argue screen layout organization conceptual locations isn useful 
cases help user maintain sense context workspace 
argue virtual location basis organizing information personal document collections hit logical search mechanism 
location search problems maintain file collections long periods time 
user involved 
way information changes time location scheme handle 
scalability 
believe search possible users don archive give archived information 
archiving unsupported difficult search mechanisms important relying short term cues location possible 
barreau nardi dismissed archiving questioning supposed coming information overload 
contrast doubt problem 
examine archiving 
reminding malone point importance reminding systems suggests inclusion computer systems 
today software systems provide little support reminding 
number time management scheduling todo list applications come market don represent integrated effort providing users basic capability 
barreau nardi observed computer users file location critical reminding function 
instance day macintosh user may leave files desktop reminder done morning 
users left electronic mail messages box remind meetings 
barreau nardi believe reminding important capability software systems support 
barreau nardi find location storage unsatisfying easily undermined method creating reminders 
see location reminding simple coping strategy lack better 
desktop metaphor semantic notion location reminding authors point reminding technique amounts behavioral trigger reminds users take action observe files certain locations 
summary location reminding amounts ad hoc user convention problems obvious way insure reminder reminds lack sufficient screen real estate long term tasks bad fit collaborative archiving barreau nardi claim old information generally useful lack importance archiving files 
concede time old information generally valuable situations occur old information essential 
recall times needed information threw away week month year ago 
fact cook shown archiving information critical organizational setting 
barreau nardi users studies archive rely archived information 
believe findings artifacts 
consider cart horse explanation archiving information difficult users archiving barreau nardi observed users obviously depend archived information 
leads wonder users old information convenient store access 
software systems handled archiving retrieval conveniently find old information reused 
underlying problem location storage archiving conflicting goals 
location storage assumes small information collection basically user remember scale large collections information 
information needed way location originally 
archived information needed context different created different location 
desktop file folder metaphor created users relate computer systems systems 
systems foremost archiving systems 
accommodate ephemeral working information state art areas messy desktop 
new metaphors pointed believe barreau nardi findings artifacts desktop file folder metaphor 
desktop metaphor created analogy world 
computerbased systems better 
emerging systems go traditional file systems user interfaces ripe study 
briefly mention dynamic queries shneiderman virtual directories mit semantic file system system lifestreams uses time metaphor fast logical searches organize monitor find summarize information 
dynamic queries shneiderman dynamic queries combine direct manipulation database visualization allow user rapidly filter information visual components sliders buttons 
user manipulation results visual feedback ms allowing quickly perceive patterns data 
visual queries applied number domains geographic database systems movie databases educational applications 
visual queries implemented form unix directory browser 
shneiderman browser user queries answered rapidly users filter irrelevant information visually scan remaining information 
location alternative unix command line requires time users visually scan larger set information 
browser step shneiderman point needs done integrating visual queries day day applications 
believe visual queries promising method locating information file system 
shneiderman reports enthusiasm users dynamic queries emanates sense control gain databases 
mentioned barreau nardi similar statements location systems obviously sense location shneiderman system users report similar feelings 
semantic file system mit semantic file system provides associative access file system virtual directories 
native directory commands ls cd virtual directory names interpreted associative queries 
results query computed automatically indexed set attributes field value pairs 
index generated number transducers map barreau nardi describe dos location system comparison unix file system 
files specific types files set attributes 
contribution semantic file system method indexing ability describe desired view file system contents 
description maps actual folder directory information virtual computed demand 
indexing important guarantees acceptable response time queries contrast macintosh find dos utilities 
indexing enables searches file entire content 
authors describe results show reasonable performance realistically sized file system precise queries answered second range 
experiments suggest semantic file systems find information quickly possible ordinary file systems 
contrast barreau nardi observations location finding dos users users semantic file system create virtual locations step logical search 
lifestreams lifestreams new model system managing personal electronic information 
lifestreams proposed described 
lifestreams uses simple organizational metaphor time ordered stream documents replace conventional files directories 
system acts electronic diary document create stored documents people send 
tail contains documents past starting principle electronic birth certificate 
moving away tail stream contains documents papers progress latest electronic mail received documents pictures correspondence bills movies voice mail software stored 
moving stream contains documents need reminders meeting schedule todo lists 
users organize locate monitor incoming information stream filters result substreams 
substreams differ conventional directory systems placing documents fixed rigid directory structures create virtual document organizations semantic file systems 
users may allow substreams persist act organizational structure creating destroying substreams inexpensive locate information quickly 
substreams dynamic 
persistent substreams continue collect new documents match search criteria 
substream summa distill overview document 
content overview document depends type documents substream 
instance overview substream holds daily closing prices stocks portfolio may contain historical investment performance chart 
historical nature stream important 
portion stream acts workspace holding working documents typically new documents created incoming documents placed 
newly created documents hang time readonly pushed past automatically archived process 
portion stream allows documents created world computers defy space time 
allowing creation gives natural method posting reminders scheduling information 
system allows user dial deposit document say reminder birthday 
birthday arrives note appears reminds 
lifestreams match way people 
lifestreams metaphor way people 
heavily information stored part stream 
older information automatically moved past users view 
anytime user needs filter information find older documents create substream 
locating information lifestreams allows user locate information ways 
ephemeral working information typically part stream 
similar location approach user returns common area locate files 
lifestreams flexible sense user tailor fly part stream looks 
ephemeral information reminders electronic mail arrives user alerted 
users quickly escape information overload working substream removes interruptions narrows focus task hand 
quickly search archived information set organization categories letting substreams persist 
directories substreams continue collect information dynamically 
reminding integral part lifestreams built semantics model 
users cre documents created disallow document creation past maintain historical perspective documents 
user interface default displays users stream past hiding part stream 
ate documents alert arriving 
users mail documents functionality workgroup 
documents act place holders meeting schedules software agents take advantage stream structure assist intelligent scheduling reminding 
archiving mentioned ways desktop metaphor prevents archiving archiving information difficult retrieving archived information 
lifestreams solves problems archiving automatic older information pushed past user view 
archived information easily retrieved 
users quickly distill large amounts archived information meaningful summaries 
general claims information narrow scope today desktop operating systems mistake 
barreau nardi helpful improving existing systems results extrapolated general statements way users acquire organize maintain retrieve information doing requires study users environments include non desktop metaphor systems 
studies may reveal different preferences users provided richer functional interaction environment
