lifestreams system 
basic model lifestreams uses simple organizational metaphor time ordered stream documents replace conventional files directories 
stream filters software agents organize locate summarize monitor incoming information 
lifestreams subsumes separate desktop applications accomplish common communication scheduling search retrieval tasks machine independent clientserver architecture open users continue document types viewers editors accustomed 
time ordered stream documents functions diary electronic life document create stored documents people send 
tail stream contains documents past starting electronic birth certificate 
moving away tail stream contains documents papers progress latest electronic mail received documents pictures correspondence bills movies voice mail software stored 
moving stream contains documents need reminders calendar items lists 
lifestreams 
studies shown users common desktop systems difficulty fl copyright material held authors 
ffl organizing finding information hierarchical file systems 
ffl making archived information users normally discard overwhelmed 
ffl getting big picture view 
ffl managing schedules reminders 
lifestreams provides metaphor organizing electronic documents easily collect come form electronic mail downloaded images pages gathered web scheduling reminders fluid natural way reflects way users 
lifestreams interface lifestreams interface showing stream documents 
user slide mouse pointer document representations glance document scroll bar lower left hand corner roll back past 
lifestreams interface 
color animation indicate important document features 
borders unread documents colored red borders writable documents thicker open documents offset side indicate edited 
incoming documents slide left side alert user newly created documents pop top push stream backwards document past 
way documents eventually moved view archived automatically 
users interact lifestreams primary operations new clone transfer find summary 
new clone create documents 
new creates empty document adds stream 
clone duplicates existing document 
transfer copies document stream 
find prompts user search query creates substream 
provides organizational framework inexpensive way finding information 
substreams virtual directories user view document collection case documents relevant search query 
substreams differ conventional directory systems placing documents fixed file folder directory structures create virtual organizations documents stream 
documents stored substream substream temporary collection documents exist stream 
substreams may overlap 
substreams created destroyed fly affecting organization provided stream existing substream 
substreams dynamic 
allow substream persist collect new documents match search criteria added stream 
example substream created query find documents created people subsume mailbox automatically collect mail arrives 
substream created electronic mail haven responded act mailbox contains unanswered mail 
substreams created incrementally yielding nested set menus 
semantically incremental amounts boolean new query previous substream query 
menus choose existing substreams create summaries reset time system clock past 
summary operation allows users distill information large number similar documents single overview substream compressing overview document 
content overview depends type documents substream 
instance substream contains daily closing prices stocks mutual funds investment portfolio overview document may contain chart displaying historical performance securities net worth 
substream contains list tasks need complete overview document display prioritized list 
default lifestreams presents user view stream receding past 
contains portion accessible usually hidden 
interface contains clock displays current time may temporarily reset observe part stream 
users deposit notes act reminders 
clock reset notes hidden arrive stream appropriate time remind user 
computer users deal far greater quantity range electronic objects personal lives 
desktop systems inadequate task new systems support management objects efficiently transparently 
success lotus notes transition operating systems document centric model ole suggests documents sun applications revolve 
lifestreams takes world step embodies software stream electronic events facing user brings applications filters summaries agents needed 
lifestreams replaces desktop metaphor fluid natural system reflects way users
