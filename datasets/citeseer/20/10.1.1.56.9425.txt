sophisticated rounds replies responses conferences discuss issues auction design pilot experiments conducted california institute technology 
mcmillan describes issues 
potential advantage allowing combinatorial bids simultaneous auction allows bidders express synergistic values 
synergies result greater revenue bid taker economically efficient allocation assets bidders 
cull ledyard illustrate situations permitting combinatorial bids essential efficient outcome 
potential disadvantages allowing combinatorial bids 
threshold problem called free rider problem milgrom wilson occur scale predominate 
example bidders competing assets suppose bidder valuation private information bidder values asset follows worth bidder worth bidder combination ab worth bidder bidder 
situation economic allocation give bidder asset bidder asset bids individual assets bidders acting unilaterally afford necessary match bid say combination ab bidder 
worth noting threshold problem opposing force exposure problem 
problem unsuccessful attempt acquire collection assets combinatorial bidding allowed may lead paying individual assets worth 
alternatively bidder unwilling risk bidding individual valuations individual assets may able obtain combination synergies efficient recipient 
arises example single change ab worth bidder 
synergies important efficiency consequences exposure problem outweigh threshold problem 
problems magnified assets sold large combinations sought 
second potential difficulty allowing combinatorial bids computational difficulty finding best revenue maximizing set winning bids

additional background fcc auction great deal material describing fcc auction design debate 
interested reader consult mcmillan extensive material fcc 
fcc adopted series general policies respect kinds auctions hold

sold simultaneous progressive auction discrete rounds 
auctions sale licence takes place bidding concluded 
bids individual binding 
bidder withdrawing bid subject covering fcc reduced revenue withdrawal 
round bidding bids increase price licence sold bidder making high bid 
order keep bidders holding back activity rules 
early auction relatively lenient third final phase auction stringent 
bidder considered active license round high bid license previous round raises bid license minimum amount required round 
bidders allotted individual round preserve immediately prior activity status round 
phase auction bidders remain active licenses covering population base third total population base wish remain eligible bid 
second phase remain active licenses covering thirds population base 
final phase remain active 
final phase bidder ceases competing license philadelphia example immediately switch bidding license license covers populous region

additional background auction design problem scholarly papers consider auction design problems introduced value interdependencies different items sale 
rothkopf considered bidder problem simultaneous auction combinatorial bids interdependency introduced constraint total bids

aside papers material cited design fcc spectrum auction aware scholarly literature topic 
frictionless existed assets sold seller concerned efficient allocation worry auction form 
form initial allocation reallocate assets efficiently 
common situation significant transaction costs costly delays associated transactions choice auction form affect economic efficiency 
addition important roles auctions provide legitimacy demonstrably fair 
choice mechanism may matter perspective 
auction designer choose sequential sale simultaneous sale progressive process time sealed bids independent sales allowing combinatorial bids 
assets sold independently bid evaluation presents problem 
assets sold time sealed bids deal time available determining winning set bids 
furthermore bid taker resort call political solution bid selection problem guarantees fairness effective 
political solution involves bid taker finding best feasible solution reasonable amount time announcing giving interested parties opportunity report feasible solution higher revenue 
apparent losing bidders incentive explore bid combinations including bids 
unable find combination reasonable amount time position challenge fairness bid acceptance process 
bidding progressive continuous involve discrete rounds 
bidding continuous new bid compared high bids displace 
exceeds current leading bid bids displaced
