discussed subsections 
pat nets body parts virtual presenter groups body parts assigned individual pat nets

move joints depending messages pointing particular position virtual board inverse kinematics particular arm posture 
pat nets body parts advantage conventional animation systems motion generators directly assign joint angles body 
pat nets structure virtual presenter 
conventional systems motion generators need manage transition current motion motion 
cases human body needs return neutral posture motion transitions motions need defined pair motions advance 
hand virtual presenter higher level motion generator issues freeing message locally moves arm neutral position particular posture depending messages

posture 
posture highly visual element presentation 
presenters stand straight feet slightly apart firmly planted floor becker becker kent graves kushner snyder posture said convey confidence graves human presenters arm hand positions serious problems 
connor advise arms hanging naturally sides kent connor virtual presenter follows rules default 
presenters shoulders oriented audience kent mandel interpreted viewpoint virtual presenter 
shoulder orientation critical visual aids presenters mainly pointing 
mandel presenters need angle away audience degrees 
virtual presenter angle viewpoint facing direction degrees default 
gesture
