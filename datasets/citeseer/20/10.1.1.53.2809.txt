serious drawback preliminary system design designer doesn know importance particular objective 
usually random lexicographic order order objectives sort chosen randomly varies generation generation

pareto optimisation definition consider vector function 
definition 
say point pareto dominates point respect function denoted inequalities strict 
say point pareto optimal non dominated function point pareto dominates 
set called pareto front respect function element pareto optimal respect function words pareto front maximal set non dominated elements 
text drop indices just write advantages pareto method ffl takes objectives consideration simultaneously ffl element pareto front solution ffl maintains diversity solutions disadvantages pareto method ffl computationally expensive maintain front needs store constantly update large set solutions ffl intuitive number objectives large pareto method genetic algorithms selections phase way pareto tournament standard tournament selection chosen individual pareto ordering pareto sort sort pareto ordering individuals dominant non dominant sort fitness value pareto truncation choose parents non dominated parents

average standard deviation runs 
results clearly show choosing different optimisation methods different objectives give totally different results globally necessary better worse just different
