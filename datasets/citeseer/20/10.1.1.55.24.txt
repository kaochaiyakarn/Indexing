tool addresses increasing need tracking third party vendor source distributions trying maintain local modifications earlier releases 

background large software development projects usually necessary software developer modifying usually different modules code time 
code modifications done experimental sense code functions correctly testing entire program usually necessary modifications returned master source repository project fix functionality inorder manage project sort revision control system necessary 
specifically unix kernel development excellent example problems adequate revision control system address 
sunos kernel composed files spread directories 
pieces kernel edited developers organization 
undesirable theory uncommon people making modifications file kernel sources order facilitate desired change 
existing revision control systems rcs tichy sccs bell serialize file modifications allowing developer writable copy particular file point time 
developer said locked file exclusive developer allowed check writable file locking developer finished impeding productivity development pressures productivity deadlines force organizations require multiple developers able simultaneously edit copies revision controlled file 
unix registered trademark sunos trademark sun microsystems ye sunos kernel composed files 
necessity multiple developers modify file concurrently questions value serialization policies traditional revision control 
discusses approach prisma took adapting standard revision control system rcs existing public domain collection shell scripts sits atop rcs provides basic conflict resolution algorithms 
resulting program cvs addresses issue multi developer open editing environment issues software release control vendor source support integration 

cvs program cvs concurrent versions system front rcs revision control system extends notion revision control collection files single directory hierarchical collection directories containing revision controlled files 
directories files cvs system combined form software release 
cvs provides functions necessary manage software releases control concurrent editing source files multiple software developers 
major features cvs listed described detail sections 
concurrent access conflict resolution algorithms guarantee source changes lost 

support tracking third party vendor source distributions maintaining local modifications sources 

flexible module database provides symbolic mapping names components larger software distribution 
symbolic mapping provides location independence software release example allows check diff program sources diff reside bin diff directory 

configurable logging support allows committed source file changes logged arbitrary program save log messages file news database 

software release symbolically tagged checked anytime tag 
exact software release checked time regardless files directories added current software release 
date check exact version software release specified date 

patch format file wall produced releases releases span multiple directories 
sources maintained cvs kept single directory source repository 
source repository holds actual rcs files directly aswell special repository directory adm contains small number administrative files describe repository accessed 
see picture cvs tree 

resolution basic conflict resolution algorithms cvs program find roots original done dick vrije universiteit amsterdam posted comp sources unix volume release 
original version cvs shell makefile halt makefile modules adm src master 
cvs source repository cvs allows software developers edit personal copies revision controlled file concurrently revision number checked file maintained independently user cvs forces checked file current head revision committed permanent change 
file brought date head revision update command cvs command compares head revision number user performs rcs merge operation 
result merge file contains user modifications committed user checked version file backup user file 
cvs points merge 
user conflicts commit changes ready 
cvs conflict resolution algorithm defined remarkably similar copy modify merge scenario included nse described honda 
explanation honda applies cvs simply stated developer copies object locking modifies copy merges modified original 
paradigm allows developers isolation changes copies objects 
locks development serialized proceed parallel 
developers merge objects changes 
particular object modified 
practice prisma conflicts occur object modified quite rare 
changes developer usually easily resolved 
practical shown copy modify merge paradigm correct useful

tracking third party source distributions currently amount software source distributions third party distributor case local modifications distribution vendor releases tracked 
rolling local modifications forward release time consuming task cvs ease burden somewhat 
checkin program cvs initially sets source repository integrating source modules directly vendor preserving directory vendor 
branch support rcs build vendor release branch main rcs trunk 
shows head tracks sample vendor branch local modifications file 
head sunos sunos sunos sunos 
cvs vendor branch example done developers check files changes vendor distribution 
local changes form tree source check outs 
shows head main rcs trunk local modification 
head sunos sunos sunos sunos 
cvs local modification vendor branch vendor distribution arrives checkin program adds changed vendor existing source repository files changed locally vendor current head revision 
files modified locally checkin warns file merged new vendor release 
cvs join command useful tool aids process performing necessary rcs merge done performing update 
limited support dual derivations source files 
see sample dual 
example tracks sunos distribution includes major changes berkeley 
bsd files rcs file branch 
bsd sunos 
cvs support dual derivations 
location independent module database cvs contains support simple powerful module database 
efficiency database stored format 
module database apply names collections directories files matter convenience checking pieces large software distribution 
database records physical location sources form information hiding allowing check directory hierarchies individual files regard actual location global source distribution 
consider small sample module database tailored manually specific source repository environment key option argument directory files 
diff bin diff libc lib libc sys sys tools links sys modules adm modules kernel sys lang adb ps bin makefile ps diff libc modules refer directory hierarchies extracted check 
sys module extracts sys hierarchy runs links program check process option specifies program run checkout 
modules module allows edit module database file runs program database cvs uses 
kernel module alias option specifies causes remaining arguments interpreted exactly specified command line 
useful objects require shared pieces code far compiled case kernel debugger shares code standard adb debugger 
ps module shows source ps bin directory makefile ps required build object 
module database prisma entire unix distribution allows issue convenient commands check components unix distribution regard actual location master source repository example cvs checkout diff example cvs checkout libc ps example cd diff building module database file quite possible name conflicts global software distribution 
example sunos provides cat programs standard environment bin cat system environment usr bin cat conflict naming standard cat module cat system cat module cat 
similar name modifications applied conflicting names utility program library function prisma chose include individual library functions module database time 

configurable logging support cvs commit command change master source repository rcs files live 
commit done log message change carefully logged arbitrary program file news database mail 
forexample collection updates produce release notices 
cvs configured send log updates filter programs regular expression match directory changed 
allows multiple related unrelated projects exist single cvs source repository tree different project sending commit reports unique log device 
logging configuration file look follows filter program default usr local bin utils updates diag usr local bin diag updates local usr local bin local updates perf usr local bin perf updates sys usr local bin kernel updates sample allows diagnostics performance groups share source repository kernel utilities groups 
changes sent directly program 
simple title substituted argument filter program executed 
logging configuration file tailored manually specific source repository environment 

tagged releases dates tag name stored directly rcs files 
tag anytime get exact previous release 
equal ease extract exact source files date past 
tag current kernel tag kernel fourth july example cvs tag test kernel kernel example cvs tag july kernel kernel command retrieve test kernel date example cvs checkout fp kernel kernel option causes files match specified tag extracted option automatically prunes empty directories 
consequently directories added kernel test kernel tagged included newly extracted test kernel 
cvs date support exactly interface provided rcs cvs process files directly due special handling required vendor branch support 
standard rcs date handling processes branch main trunk checking date specification 
cvs process current head branch match proceed look match vendor branch 
combined reasons performance cvs processes revision symbolic numeric date specifications directly files 

building patch source distributions cvs produce patch format wall output file bring previously released software distribution current newest release 
patch file supports entire directory single patch able add previous release 
combine symbolic revisions dates display changes generic way example cvs patch december january sys example displays kernel changes month december 
patch file example cvs distribution version version done follows example cvs patch cvs 
cvs experience 
statistics summary scale cvs addressing today table 
table shows history files changed added number source lines affected change prisma 
changes kernel sources included 
large number source file changes september result merging sunos sources kernel 
merge process described section 

performance performance cvs currently quite reasonable 
little effort expended tuning cvs performance related decisions cvs design 
example cvs parses rcs files directly running rcs process 
includes branches integrating vendor source branches main trunk revision control statistics prisma 
total files directories lines code software developers software groups megabytes source table 
cvs statistics prisma kernel source file changes month changed lines added lines files changed files added month dec jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct total table 
cvs usage history kernel checking files date 
checking entire kernel source tree files directories currently takes wall clock minutes sun 
bringing tree date current kernel sources checked takes wall clock minutes 
updating complete mbyte source tree cvs control files directories takes roughly wall clock minutes utilizes third machine 
entirely acceptable improvements numbers possibly 

sunos merge true test cvs vendor branch support came sunos source upgrade tape 
described checkin program install new sources resulting output file listed files locally modified needing merged manually kernel files conflict 
cvs join command conflicting files remaining conflicts resolved 
join command performs operation 
turn uses usr lib diff produce way 
happens diff program hard coded limit source file changes maximum 
small kernel files needed merging hand due large number local changes prisma 
diff problem solved increasing hard coded limit order magnitude 
sunos kernel source upgrade distribution contained files modifications previously released files newly added files 
checkin added source repository intervention 
modified files dropped cleanly checkin prisma changes required manual merging due local modifications 
modified files consisted lines differences 
took developer manually merge files join command resolving conflicts manually day required kernel debugging 
entire process merging lines differences completed week 
time savings justification cvs development effort expect gain tracking sunos releases 

current bugs cvs incomplete reasons design simplicity naturally number enhancements useful 
exist current implementation 
cvs currently remember checked 
result impossible working module 
minded database updated nightly suffice 
signal processing keyboard interrupt handling particular somewhat weak 
due heavy system library function execute rcs programs ci takes multiple interrupts cvs quit 
fixed home grown system replacement 
security source repository currently dealt directly usual unix approach user group security permissions file system utilized 
cvs set group id executable checks protected database verify user access permissions particular objects allowing operations affect objects 
checked directory cvs maintains administrative files record current revision numbers checked files location respective source repository 
cvs administrative files removed 
source code cvs tested extensively sun sun systems running sunos versions operating system 
code compiled platforms portability code questionable 
previous section cvs method tracking third party vendor source distributions quite nicely ifthe vendor changes directory structure file names source distribution cvs way matching old release 
currently unclear certain happen practice 

availability cvs program sources posting comp sources unix newsgroup 
currently available anonymous ftp prisma com 
copying rights cvs covered gnu general public license 

summary prisma cvs december 
evolved meet specific needs revision release control 
code freely available benefit enhance cvs meet broader needs 
software release revision control systems described glew appear collection tools geared specific environments set tools kernel set generic software set utilities set kernel utilities 
tool sets apparently handle specific aspect problem uniquely 
cvs took somewhat different approach 
file sharing symbolic hard links addressed disk space simply burned cheap support producing objects multiple architectures addressed parallel checked source tree architecture wasting disk space simplify complexity ease issue allowed unchanged approach taken mahler maintaining closer compatibility third party vendor sources 
cvs essentially source file server making assumptions special handling sources controls 
cvs source course course course source ed
