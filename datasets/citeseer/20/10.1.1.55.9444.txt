standard ml new jersey compiler development years 
developed robust complete environment standard ml supports implementation large software systems generates cient code 
compiler served laboratory developing novel implementation techniques sophisticated type module system continuation code generation cient pattern matching concurrent programming features 
standard ml new jersey compiler programming environment standard ml language continuously developed early 
initial goal produce working ml front interpreter programming language research scope project expanded considerably 
believe standard ml may best general purpose programming language developed demonstrate provide high quality robust cient tools software engineering 
way learned useful things design implementation modern programming languages 
unexpected interactions module system type system code generator debugger garbage collector runtime data format hardware things easier expected 
wrote early description compiler spring component compiler redesigned reimplemented worthwhile provide updated overview system implementation experience 
compiler structured conventional way input stream broken tokens lexical analyzer parsed context supported part nsf ccr 
free grammar semantically analyzed annotated syntax tree type checked translated lower level intermediate language 
front compiler 
intermediate language continuation passing style optimized closures introduced implement lexical scoping registers allocated target machine instructions generated risc machines instructions scheduled avoid pipeline delays constitute back 
parsing early development compiler hand written lexical analyzer parser 
components code semantic analysis intermixed parsing code 
error recovery difficult di cult understand syntax semantics individually 
excellent tools automatic generation lexical analyzers error correcting parsers 
syntactic error recovery handled automatically parser generator semantic actions evaluated correct corrected parses 
greatly improved quality error messages robustness compiler incorrect inputs 
helpful definition standard ml included lr grammar language 
places ml grammar appear context free 
treatment data constructors definition constructor names di erent lexical class variable names distinction depends semantic analysis previous datatype definitions 
putting constructors variables class lexical tokens name space parsing done correctly di erence resolved semantic analysis 
context dependent aspect syntax parsing infix identifiers 
ml allows programmer specify identifier infix operator precedence ranging 
solution problem completely ignore operator precedence writing lalr grammar expression parsed list semantic analysis routines include simple operator precedence parser lines ml 
production grammar annotated semantic action roughly style popular yacc 
semantic actions written denotational semantics attribute grammar fragment function takes inherited attributes parameters returns synthesized attributes results 
actions occasional side ects typechecker performs unification modification ref cells 
complete parse yields function parameterized static environment identifiers defined previous compilation units 
side ects occur applied point distributed function calls levels parse tree 
essence applied tree closures pointing isomorphic concrete parse tree program 
introduce myriad data constructors describe concrete parse trees 
delaying semantic actions useful error correcting parser 
error parse occurs parser want correct point tokens previous means discarding semantic actions 
actions side ects easy discard 
complete correct parse constructed semantic value applied environment side ects go right order 
treatment mutually recursive definitions easier delayed semantic actions newly defined identifiers entered environment right hand sides processed 
disadvantage arrangement 
turns closure representation concrete parse tree larger annotated parse tree results performing semantic actions 
conventional style actions performed input parsed compiler memory 
parser generator provides nonterminal input line number position line program fragment corresponding nonterminal 
add accurate locality information error messages 
furthermore line numbers sprinkled annotated syntax tree type checker match compiler debugger give diagnostics 
semantic analysis static environment maps variable program binding containing type runtime access information 
type compiletime type checking runtime 
access information typically name lowlevel calculus variable manipulated code generator 
static environments map kinds identifiers data constructors type constructors structure names kinds bindings 
initial implementation treated environments imperatively operations environments add new binding global environment mark save state environment revert back previous mark implementation module system encapsulate special table added particular mark 
knew better denotational semantics attribute grammars treat environments pure values combined yield larger environments thought imperative environments faster 
changed pure functional style environments operations create environment single binding layer environment top yielding new environment 
implementation data type side ects su ciently large environment values represented hash tables change accommodate new debugger allow user environments simultaneously allow implementation programs need explicit control static environments programs compiled 
willing su er performance degradation exchange flexibility pure environments just fast imperative ones 
illustrates general principle noticed ml program development 
parts compiler initially implemented imperative style rewritten piecemeal cleaner functional style 
advantages ml programs programmers migrate gradually functional programming 
type checking main type checking algorithm changed relatively little earlier description 
representations types type constructors type variables cleaned various ways basic algorithm type checking straightforward unification algorithm 
complex part type checking algorithm deals weak polymorphism restricted form polymorphism required handle mutable values arrays exception transmission communication extensions concurrent ml 
standard ml new jersey implements generalization imperative type variables described definition 
scheme imperative type variables replaced weak type variables associated degree weakness nonnegative integer 
type variable weak involved type expression denoting degree weakness roughly measures number function applications take place value created 
weakness degree zero disallowed top level insures top level values existing values top level environment monomorphic types 
type checking algorithm uses type occ keep track applicative context expression occurrences approximately balance function abstractions function applications surrounding expression occ value variable occurrence determines weakness degree generic type variables introduced occurrence 
occ value binding determine type variables generalized 
weak typing scheme fairly subtle prone bugs important formalized proven sound tofte scheme tofte thesis 
people currently working formalizing treatment compiler :10.1.1.44.5122
weak polymorphism scheme currently standard ml new jersey regarded final word polymorphism 
shares imperative type variable scheme fault weak polymorphism propagates widely necessary 
purely internal temporary uses function definition poison function giving weak type 
example definition fun ref type ought strong polymorphic type 
inessential weak polymorphism particularly annoying interferes matching signature specification merely imperative style function definition 
implementation choices invisible type 
research continues problem satisfactory solution 
interface type checker parser quite simple respects 
entry point type checker function called type check value declaration top level structure 
interface type checking parser complicated problem determining scope binding point explicit type variables appear program 
subtle scoping rules type variables section section force parser pass sets type variables upward downward synthesized inherited attributes phrases 
determined set explicit type variables bound definition stored syntax representation definition available typechecker

functor application instantiation formal parameter matching actual parameter followed instantiation functor body 
clear instantiation structure templates signatures functor bodies critical process module system 
process prone consume excessive space time implemented naively 
implementation achieved reasonable ciency separating volatile part template changes instance stable part common instances representation may shared instances 
volatile components stored instantiation environment referred indirectly bindings shared symbol table static environment indices paths instantiation environment 
instantiation environment represented pair arrays type constructor components substructures 
static representation structure essentially environment symbol table containing bindings types variables identifying stamp 
second implementation signature represented dummy instance di ers ordinary structure volatile components contain dummy bound stamps carries additional information specifying sharing constraints 
volatile components bound stamps replaced instantiated signature matching corresponding components structure matched 
similarly functor body represented structure dummy stamps replaced newly generated stamps functor applied 
problem representing signatures functor bodies dummy structures bound stamps need alpha conversion various points avoid confusing bound stamps 
minimize problem previous implementation insures sets bound stamps signature functor body disjoint 
problem signatures functors separately compiled imported new context alpha conversion bound stamps required maintain disjointness property 
managing bound stamps source complexity bugs module system 
usual way avoiding complications bound variables replace indexing scheme done debruijn indices lambda calculus 
symbol table part indices instantiation arrays refer volatile components avoid bound stamps relativized symbol table represent signatures 
drop instantiation environment part signature representation leaving symbol table part need revise details environments represented 
substructure specification represented symbol table binding indicating ith substructure rest specification form dummy structure ith slot instantiation environment 
dropping dummy instantiation environment information specifying binding 
new implementation uses pos spec sig binding substructure signature specification available immediately symbol table having access indirectly instantiation environment 
improvement representation signatures instantiations scope instantiation environments 
old implementation substructure instantiation environment 
substructure may contain relative component substructure example signature sig structure sig type structure sig val type refers type component represented standpoint relative path parent substructure type constructor 
accommodate cross structure structure local instantiation environment structure slot instantiation environment contains pointer parent signature structure 
defining maintaining parent pointers source complexity representation highly cyclical 
new representation avoids problem having single instantiation environment shared top level signature embedded signatures 
embedded signature written line signatures example 
example new representation type constructor occupy type constructor slot shared instantiation environment

component signature order specified check corresponding component structure component satisfies specification 
check succeeds may result instance volatile component type constructor entered new instantiation environment

functors key idea process functor definition isolate volatile components result deriving parameter arising generative declarations body instantiation environment

case signature matching minimizes ort required create instance body functor applied symbol table information inherited unchanged instance 
defining functor done steps formal parameter signature instantiated create dummy parameter structure 
dummy structure bound formal parameter name current environment resulting environment parse type check functor body expression

resulting body structure scanned volatile components identified having stamps belonging dummy parameter generated body volatile components replaced indirect positional instantiation environment 
instantiation parameter signature produce structure free modulo sharing constraints contained signature 
words satisfy explicit sharing constraints signature implicit sharing constraints implied extraneous sharing 
algorithm instantiation process mainly due george gonthier vaguely related linear unification algorithms 
instantiation process create structures declared abstractions abstraction declaration standard ml new jersey nonstandard extension language

translation language semantic analysis phase static program errors detected result parse tree annotated type information 
translated strict lambda calculus augmented data constructors numeric string constants tuples mutually recursive functions various primitive operators arithmetic manipulation refs numeric comparisons translation language phase compiler changed years 
language data constructors pattern matches 
simple case statement determines constructor applied top level value 
pattern matches ml translated discriminations individual constructors 
done described previous bruce duba revised details algorithm 
dynamic semantics structures functors represented lambda language operators records functions core language 
means code generator runtime system don need know module system great convenience 
phase handle equality tests 
ml allows hereditarily nonfunctional values type tested equality values polymorphic types 
cases types determined compile time 
equality atomic types integer real substitute cient primitive operator generic equality function 
constructed datatypes tested equality automatically construct set mutually recursive functions specific instance datatype compiled code user program 
type truly polymorphic known compile time general polymorphic equality function invoked 
function interprets tags objects runtime recursively compare bit patterns knowing full types objects testing equality 
standard ml polymorphic equality seriously complicates compiler 
front special equality type variables indicate polymorphic types required admit equality signatures keyword denote exported types admit equality 
property propagated types structures share functor definition 
estimate code front compiler implement polymorphic equality 
ect back runtime system just 
ml statically typed language necessary type tags descriptors runtime object lisp 
reasons tags garbage collector understand traverse pointers records polymorphic equality function 
possible give garbage collector map type system types runtime objects tags descriptors 
polymorphic equality function uses tags sophisticated garbage collector done away 
alternative pass function value equality type quite costly 
treatment equality types standard ml irregular incomplete 
definition categorizes type constructors equality nonequality type constructors refined classification accurately specify ects ref operator 
types structurally support equality classified nonequality types definition 
conversion cps language converted continuationpassing style cps optimization code generation 
cps clean semantic properties calculus matches execution model von neumann register machine variables cps correspond closely registers machine leads cient code 
language side ecting operators specify call value strict order evaluation really pin meaning program means simply arbitrary reductions partially evaluate optimize program 
conversion cps order evaluation information encoded chaining function calls doesn matter consider cps strict nonstrict 
reductions optimizations easier specify implement 
cps notation representation described detailed description optimization techniques runtime representations cps 
just summarize important points 
continuation passing style function arguments contrast ml functions formally parameter 
actual parameters function atomic constant variable 
operands arithmetic operator atomic result operation bound newly defined variable 
provision binding result function call variable functions return 
cps compiling programming language functions usually allowed return results expressions nontrivial sub expressions necessary continuations 
saying function call returns value function expresses rest program result call cps 
cps returning call result cps conversion source language function call looks just source language function return look calls cps 
means easy reduce call reducing return vice versa kind flexibility useful reasoning optimizing tail recursion strict calculus reduction problematical 
actual parameters function side ects terminate safely substituted formal parameters body function 
actual parameter expression contain call unknown compile time function case impossible tell side ect 
cps actual parameters function atomic expressions side ects terminate safe easy perform reduction kinds substitutions 
optimizer take great advantage unique property ml records tuples constructors immutable 
ref cells arrays identifiable compile time type system record created modified 
means fetch record yield result compiler arranges performed earlier specified program 
allows greater freedom partial evaluation fetches pattern matches instruction scheduling common subexpression elimination compilers permitted 
think pure functional language haskell immutable record property similarly useful languages usually lazy fetches lazy cell yield di erent results second times 
similar property ml immutable records distinguishable address 
records contain values expressions val indistinguishable context 
case programming languages di erent pairs list different addresses distinguished pointer equality test 
means compiler free perform common sub expression elimination record expressions convert expression second garbage collector free copies record possibly useful concurrent collection merge copies kind delayed hash consing distributed implementation free keep separate copies record di erent machines really exploited opportunities 
closure conversion conversion calculus cps control flow program explicit useful performing optimizations 
phase compiler closure conversion explicit access nonlocal variables lexical scope 
ml scheme smalltalk languages function definitions may nested inside inner function free variables bound outer function 
representation function value runtime include way access values free variables 
closure data structure allows function represented pointer record containing 
address machine code entry point body function 

values free variables function 
code pointer item kept standardized location closures function passed argument function able extract address order jump necessary keep free variables item standard order simply pass closure pointer extra argument know extract free variables 
mechanism quite old reasonably cient 
closures usually performed part machine code generation separate phase rewrites cps representation program include closure records 
output phase cps expression guaranteed function free variables expression explicit record creation operators build closures explicit fetch operators extract code pointers free variables 
closure bundled aspects code generation easier introduce sophisticated closure techniques breaking rest compiler 
general structuring compiler phases clean welldefined interface proven successful allowing proceed independently di erent parts compiler 
initially considered variations di erent closure representations call flat linked 
flat closure function record containing code pointer values free variables 
linked closure contains code pointer value free variable bound enclosing function pointer enclosing function closure 
variables free enclosing function traversing linked list closures starting just method access links implementing static scope pascal 
linked closures cheaper build single pointer enclosing scope free variables scope access getting free variable requires traversing linked list 
fact investigated di erent representational tricks spectrum flat linked closures including tricks closure record di erent functions di erent code pointers 
traditional compiler tricks significant di erence 
cps representation appears pattern functions variable access narrows ective di erence techniques closure representation usually important 
aspects closures important 
shown linked merged closures cause compiled program memory 
example program compiled flat closures memory simultaneous live data input size program compiled linked closures 
may happen rarely believe unacceptable especially programmer way understand going 
re examining closure representations ensure safety memory usage essentially means sticking flat closures 
introduced notion registers normally unknown function compilation unit called compiler cps registers variables needed call free variables continuation 
stored continuation closure fetched back continuation invoked 
conventional compiler caller function similarly save registers stack frame fetch back call 
conventional compilers callee save registers 
responsibility function leave registers needed execution function saved restored callee 
represent callee save variables original cps language changing interface 
represent continuation argument arguments 
kn continuation invoked return value variables 
kn passed arguments continuation 
code generator keeps cps variables registers including function parameters variables 
kn ect callee save registers 
su cient obtain significant improvement performance 
final code generation operators cps notation especially closure conversion similar instructions simple register memory von neumann machine 
trend risc machines large register sets cps code generation attractive 
relatively simple matter translate closure converted cps simple machine instructions translated native machine code mips sparc vax mc 
machines risc machines really job code generation add final peephole optimization phase 
risc machines final instruction scheduling phase minimize delays run time pipeline interlocks 
interesting aspect final code generation register allocation 
closure conversion code generation spill phase rewrites cps expression limit number free variables subexpression number registers target machine 
turns functions require rewriting especially modern machines registers spills lines code typical 
free variables expression guaranteed fit registers register allocation simple matter variable bound variables live free continuation operation binds variable number registers 
remaining registers chosen hold new value 
place register register move required procedure call actual parameters shu ed locations required formal parameters 
functions call sites evident compiler functions passed parameters stored data structures choose register bindings formal parameters eliminate moves calls 
clever choices register bindings described paragraph eliminate remaining register register moves required procedure calls 
runtime system absence function returns means runtime stack formally required execute programs 
cps compilers introduce runtime stack anyway 
keep closures activation records garbage collected heap 
simplifies aspects runtime system class continuations call current continuation efficient 
closures put heap sml nj allocates garbage collected storage rate bit word storage instructions executed approximately 
means important requirement runtime system support fast storage allocation fast garbage collection 
heap allocations cheap generational copying garbage collector keep format runtime data simple 
copying collection attractive collector touches live data garbage arrange particular region memory garbage just operations reclaim large amount storage 
advantage copying collection free area allocate new records contiguous block memory easier grab words block manage free list di erent sized records 
keep pointers free area registers fast access 
allocation initialization word record requires store instructions di erent sets free space register followed addition constant size new record register 
perform allocations line procedure call just test free storage exhaustion cover allocations procedure remember cps procedures don internal loops 
furthermore perform test single cycle instruction clever overflow interrupt initiate garbage collection 
garbage collection overhead standard ml new jersey memory size equal times amount live data usually means word memory allocated amortized cost collecting instruction 
copying data structure reading writing new copy takes times long traversing examining fields 
encourages side ect free functional style programming 
addition garbage collector runtime system provides interface operating system calls 
higher level services bu ered provided standard library written standard ml 
language functions runtime system callable ml provided easy interface users link foreign language functions called ml 
overhead calling function high implemented half dozen frequently functions allocation array string assembly language
