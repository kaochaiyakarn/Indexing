types theory change assume quite different relations theory new information 
simple illustration relations consider jury trial

revision assumes new information important reliable theory 
may happen organizes set witnesses reliable reliable 
example witness may distant relative second close relative defendant 
distant relative may say defendant social

jury needs revision 
update assumes new information theory 
may happen organizes witnesses chronologically 
example witness may claim defendant bought gun january 
second witness may say defendant sold gun february 
jury needs update
