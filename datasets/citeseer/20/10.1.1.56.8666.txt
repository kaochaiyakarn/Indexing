argumentation constitutes major component human intelligence 
ability engage arguments essential humans understand new problems perform scientific reasoning express clarify defend opinions daily lives 
way humans argue simple principle summarized succinctly old saying word best 
illustrate principle take look example mock argument persons countries war responsible blocking negotiation region 
example government negotiate government government doesn recognize government government doesn recognize government explicit content utterance failure government recognize government blocks negotiation 
establishes responsibility government blocking negotiation implicit appeal commonsense interpretation rule responsibility attribution actor performs action causes state affairs actor responsible state affairs action justified 
uses kind reasoning government responsible blocking negotiation government doesn recognize government 
point claim victory hurting position 
consider continuation arguments government terrorist government utterance justifies failure government recognize government 
responsibility attribution rule applied government responsible blocking negotiation
