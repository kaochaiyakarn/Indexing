abandoning distance axioms distance axioms provide unnecessarily rigid system properties similarity measures

logic predicate distance functions ordinal property pd ffi 
tversky gati identified ordinal properties replace metric axioms call monotone proximity structure 
suppose sake simplicity feature space dimensions perceived distance stimuli 
monotone proximity structure characterized properties dominance dimensional dissimilarity exceeds dimensional projections distance 
consistency ordinal relation dissimilarities dimension independent coordinate

third property monotone proximity structure transitivity jx jx jx jx jx jx jx jx framework general geometric distance distance measures dominance consistency transitivity proximity structures satisfy distance axioms 
dominance weak form triangle inequality applies coordinate axes 
consistency ensures certain ordinal properties related ordering features change changed see details :10.1.1.26.1823
transitivity ensures relation behaves metric model moving axes feature space 
note euclidean model isotropic property holds hold series collinear points irrespective direction line joins 
measuring perceptual distance directions feature axes special status 
distance measures proposed literature feature contrast model predict dominance consistency transitivity hold 
help discriminate different models tversky gati proposed fourth ordinal axiom call corner inequality 
jx jx jy jy corner inequality holds fig 
easy see corner equality holds corner path longer diagonal path 
minkowski metrics satisfy corner inequality observed violations corner inequality falsify models minkowski metrics 
tversky gati evidence certain conditions experiments show violations corner inequality seemingly invalidating geometric models similarity 
set theoretic similarity amos tversky proposed famous feature contrast model 
considering stimuli points metric space tversky characterized sets binary features 
words stimulus si characterized set features stimulus possesses 
equivalently feature set set logic predicates true stimulus question 
stimuli respective sets features measure similarity tversky theory assumptions corner inequality corner path longer path inside rectangle 
matching gamma gamma monotonicity gamma gamma gamma gamma function satisfies matching monotonicity called matching function
