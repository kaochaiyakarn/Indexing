salton mcgill review number systems 
systems provide boolean operators operate sets documents 
operator intersects document sets operator combines document sets 
operator usually implements set difference complement document set respect second set 
words act elementary terms representing set documents containing word 
example query evaluate set documents contain words 
various extensions incorporated basic algebra word truncation operators select documents containing word specified prefix 
proximity operators select documents basis word adjacency word concatenation similar criteria 
systems provide limited support document structure 
generally document divided predefined fields typically title author date body 
queries may refer fields 
example query specify body selected document contain word author field contain shakespeare 
large blocks text divided sentences paragraphs predefined units 
documents may selected basis words appearing sentence paragraph 
unfortunately techniques dealing document structure excessively rigid 
document structure mapped predefined fields textual units lost referenced query

structured text text natural structure 
document may divide chapters pages sentences paragraphs sections subsections books volumes issues lines verses 
document may include title preface epilogue quotes emphasised passages notes 
characteristics documents vary greatly 
document may identified author may anonymous may precisely dated may may written russian characters may written japanese may part larger may stand 
document structured differently structure may vary document

examples document structure express query required result play page speech line merely fragment text specified terms structure 
system capturing document structure flexible accommodate variations structure occur naturally 
unfortunately requirement odds attempts impose fixed schema database 
possible index structure document thought important time document added database possible add structural indexing time 
furthermore structural element irrelevant document hand artificial requirement index structural element necessary break poem paragraphs 
structural hierarchy assumed 
researchers hierarchical relationships describe document structure 
document structure strictly hierarchical paragraphs stretch pages sentences stretch lines 
containment structural element significant document structure sentences usually wholly contained paragraph lines usually wholly contained page 
argued increasing availability documents electronic form structural elements pages lines irrelevant merely artifacts older technology 
case 
example page numbers essential citing federal court decisions federal courts 
ownership page numbers citation purposes enforced major publisher legal decisions 
databases publisher index report citations copyrighted page numbers making database effectively worthless 
extreme example pages lines ignored primary form text remains printed page 
document markup handled cleanly 
documents stored manipulated electronically document structure specified form markup tagging scheme delimit various structural elements 
markup tag takes form special character sequence embedded text 
standard document formats including sgml oda troff embedded tagging schemes delimit structural elements 
presence markup tags document formats suggests indexing tags effective approach capturing document structure 
problems exist approach 
different document formats different syntax tags 
despite differences desirable delimiters equivalent structural elements indexed 
example paragraph boundaries indexed regardless particular paragraph delimiters various document formats 
document formats explicitly tag certain structural elements 
possible index structural elements 
time remain possible index tags specific document format 
particular word processor format clearly delimit paragraph boundaries necessary heuristic identify boundaries 
case indexing document specific tags addition paragraph boundaries permit queries actual structure document inferred structure document 
circumstances inferred structure accurately reflect true structure 
metric necessary specify proximity elements text 
desirable view text sequence words basic textual units 
tags treated words proximity purposes 
distance words depend variations tagging schemes 
example words visually adjacent printed form document indexed adjacent regardless presence absence tag changes font word 
solution assign integer positions words permit tags take rational values 
tags may indexed arbitrarily word positions 
approach simplifies incremental indexing document 
example font changes indexed document added database indexing added time re indexing entire document
