database object tuple query device construction primitives selector function selector function actual database filtering function type predicate 
example selector top selects homes attribute value selected slider selector functions take value basic ranging int real string range ranging basic set basic set range set tuple database return set tuples fulfilling criterion set query device 
selector function types exist selected filter value database objects basic set tuple set tuple set basic set tuple set tuple range set tuple set tuple set range set tuple set tuple type describe selecting behavior 
query device allowing users select single integer numerous semantics possible 
richer description predicates describe exact behavior selector function
