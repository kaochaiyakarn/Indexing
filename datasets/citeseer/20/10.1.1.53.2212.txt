probability findings dependent severity disease 
disease mild low probability findings disease severe findings common 
node representing disease binary way provide appropriate probabilities add dependencies findings 
example consider mild severe forms disease 
times represented single node right part 
representation asymmetric avoid cycle 
required probabilities maintain distribution shown right computed shown 
probability connecting link indicate stronger association findings cause artifact severity manifestation 
natural representation give disease node multiple values representing possible severities disease 
structure maintains intended causality conveys information may useful managing patient 
distribution requirement noisy function context translates requirement probabilities increase stay severity increases 
normally true number nodes hdp finding probabilities decrease 
example aortic stenosis 
lesion severe lower cardiac output inaudible diagnosis may missed 
important correctable condition left untreated time fatal 
kind situation hdp needed 
implementing hdp natural divisions severities points new manifestations possible manifestations qualitatively different 
example node aortic stenosis severities 
mild causes appears sensitive tests 
second severity causes left ventricular lv 
third severity causes limitations cardiac output decreased exercise response high filling pressure 
severe form causes weakened ventricle dilated 
different definition severity traditionally focuses measured valve areas serves different purpose 
provide division model simplifies data reasoning 
division manifestation enables identifying severity clinical findings requiring extensive testing 
easier classify cases knowledge acquisition allows pruning problem space diagnostic reasoning 
hdp initial pass input data eliminating severe states diseases absence discriminating manifestations

qualitative severities consistent observation structure network important accurate diagnosis actual probabilities probabilities difference 
modeling disease types heart disease domain diseases distinct type 
example primary aortic ar different 
keep model simple hdp includes disease covering distinct patterns unique findings 
example ar may evidence process

important aspect different disease provide appropriate probabilities multiple lesions multiple lesions common combinations lesions characteristic different 
different types representing primary disease ar different types depending problem root aortic root valve leaflet damage characterized distinct findings 
ar caused acute processes distinguished 
acute ar secondary failed valve replacement aortic dissection 
ar absent month ago diagnosis immediately focuses aortic dissection 
disease type provides template represent important qualitative distinctions

physicians tend describe diagnosis learn terms disease patterns useful capture expertise model similar patterns

modeling temporal relations main source problems bpn methodology need reasoning time domain 
number ways problems arise

example acute mi causes pulmonary congestion pulmonary congestion occasionally causes takes days weeks produce 
acute mi explain discovered day 
second problem wide range time scales changes heart disease take place 
findings provided heart sounds reflect immediate 
findings pulmonary congestion take hours pedal takes days ventricular months usually stenosis takes years 
third problem need multiple instances nodes explain findings 
example aortic ar leading valve replacement replacement failing causing acute type aortic

approach temporal reasoning discussed detail 
problem effects requiring time means states pulmonary congestion represented single node traditional bpn truth state insufficient information determine probability effects 
pulmonary congestion caused acute mi different effects pulmonary congestion caused dilated

cardiac output decreased normalized units final stable state changes table right 
gains sum decrease plus increase vr results decrease bp changes consistent 
blood pressure decreases increase vr adjusts rest decrease cardiac output 
high gain negative feedback change blood pressure probably undetectable 
natural way represent aggregate causality qualitative states shown top

general situation fixed acyclic network adequately represent possible causal relationships

feedback circuit accurate model physical reality changes take place uncertainty 
probability represents frequency change qualitative range low produces change falls qualitative range effect parameter

forward cycles network final issue representation existence cycles domain

example pulmonary increase resistance lungs may decrease cardiac output 
low cardiac output primary causes pulmonary 
patient greater risk pulmonary mention factors pulmonary 
pattern emerges individual increased probability disease patient past incidence event 
particularly important reason appropriately pulmonary common cause hospitalization 
second kind cycle true positive feedback 
shock example

hdp approach taken represent cycles model allow cycles hypotheses program generates 
alleviates problems trying separate causality hypertension renal insufficiency 
program picks causality consistent available evidence maximizes probability hypothesis 
problem recurrences pulmonary require multiple instances pulmonary node sequential time intervals

poor ventricular function accounts low cardiac output low oxygen delivery 
positive feedback cycles heart disease domain adequate situations acute hdp practical benefit
