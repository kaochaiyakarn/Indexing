discussion density classification problem discussed belongs class test solution problems described paredis 
goal problems find solution satisfies set tests 
due characteristics earlier applications paredis tests sufficiently small number listed exhaustively 
need real evolution reproduction selection tests 
general lesson learned experiments described cautious coevolution solving optimization problems 
arms race typical predator prey systems lead optimal solution problem solved 
especially solution satisfying possible tests case tests keep solutions constant attack 
solution tests virtually unreachable coevolutionary dynamics 
due high degree epistasis linkages populations 
due linkages small change individuals population require extensive changes population 
seen small highly probable changes alter configuration population way ca population able respond swiftly 
reason problem relative fitness depends members population solve artificial man problem exists clear absolute optimization criterion 
seen translation absolute relative fitness straightforward 
order survive individuals beat population 
solving artificial problem result fit solution population test population total 
evolution test population may find way avoid 
alternative algorithm proposed quite drastic eliminates evolution population 
nature inspire incorporate mechanisms 
example different reproduction rates populations 
evolve interaction species 
kauffman suggest nature may couplings species achieve successful 
careful successful stands survival solving artificial pre defined problem 
furthermore predator prey interactions nature considerably different ones 
example nature prey population small predators get hard time population size diminishes predator feeds species 
way selection pressure prey decreases 
cga hand uses fixed population sizes 
solution proposed goes step order preserve diversity contents population remains 
certainly worth investigate diversity preserving schemes fitness sharing 
clearly research needed fully exploit coevolutionary mechanisms computation 
general hypothesis put forward 
relative fitness evaluation environment really unpredictable 
puts strong pressure individuals genes easily mutated individuals easily respond 
occur case multiple non populations 
single population individuals exhibit phenomenon 
model bird song imitations kaneko suzuki shows 
single population birds 
fitness bird determined hard birds imitate song imitating song birds 
fact model evolution leads edge chaos periodic window 
experiments illustrate case small mutation yield completely different behavior birds easily respond 
transition order chaos high density different dynamical behaviors 
volatile environment better prepared change
