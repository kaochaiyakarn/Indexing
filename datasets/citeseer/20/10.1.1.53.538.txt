distributional information emphasized past part researchers focused long texts 
address issues introduce new display paradigm called tilebars allows users simultaneously view relative length retrieved documents relative frequency query terms distributional properties respect document 
tilebars useful analytical tool understanding results boolean type queries preliminary indicates useful determining document relevance applied sample queries standard full text test collection 
approach visualization role query terms retrieved documents may help explain standard information retrieval measures succeed fail query 
background standard information retrieval purpose information retrieval help users effectively access large collections objects goal satis fying users stated information needs 
common approaches text retrieval boolean term specification similarity search 
term similarity search umbrella term covering vector space model probabilistic models approach attempts find documents similar query solely primarily terms contain 
similarity search effect ranks documents close multidimensional term space combinations documents terms combinations terms query 
closer documents term space topics presumed common 
reasonable framework comparing short documents goal discover pairs documents alike 
example query set medical abstracts contains terms name disease symptoms possible treatments best matched similar constitution possible 
similarity search best matches necessarily ones largest percentage query terms 
example query terms vector space model permits document contains subset query terms ranked relatively high terms occur infrequently corpus frequently document 
boolean retrieval query stated terms disjunctions conjunctions negations sets documents contain particular words phrases 
documents retrieved contents satisfy conditions boolean statement 
users control terms appear retrieved documents similarity search 
basic form boolean search produce ranking order ranking criteria similarity search applied results boolean search 
problem ranking great concern information retrieval literature rank results boolean similarity searches 
contend concern misplaced 
manageable subset thousands available documents issue matter providing user information informative compact interpreted swiftly 
discussed subsection different ways long text similar query issued focus collections textual information media types apply

query 
shows example new representational paradigm called tilebars provides compact informative iconic representation documents contents respect query terms 
tilebars allow users informed decisions documents view passages documents distributional behavior query terms documents 
mentioned goal simultaneously indicate relative length document frequency term sets document distribution term sets respect document 
large rectangle indicates document square document represents 
darker tile frequent term white indicates black indicates instances frequencies terms term set added 
bars set query terms lined produces representation simultaneously compactly indicates relative document length query term frequency query term distribution 
representation exploits natural pattern recognition capabilities human perceptual system patterns column tilebars quickly scanned 
term overlap term distribution easy compute displayed manner attributes create easily recognized patterns 
example darkness indicates text term sets discussed detail 
term sets discussed simultaneously corresponding tiles blend cause prominent block appear 
scattered discussions lightly colored tiles large areas white space 
tilebars visualization properties extracted ffl variation position size value gray scale saturation texture ordered ordinal imposes order universal immediately perceptible 
ffl shading sure differences shading line values represented 
lightest unfilled regions represent darkest filled regions represent 
ffl natural visual hierarchy varying shades gray show varying quantities better color 
note stacking terms query specification portion document reflected stacking tiling information top row indicates frequencies terms term set bottom row corresponds term set

tilebars allow users aware part document view viewing 
see document simply mouse click part representation symbolizes document 
alternatively may go directly segment middle text terms term sets overlap knowing advance far document passage occurs

computer aided medical diagnosis figures show results query term sets version interface allows user restrict documents displayed constraints minimum number hits term set minimum distribution percentage tiles containing hit minimum adjacent overlap span 
example user interested documents discuss computeraided techniques medical diagnosis query conjunction term sets patient medicine medical test scan cure diagnosis software program 
user indicated document contain substantive discussion diagnosis terms overlap term sets occur span adjacent tiles 
note looser restriction yields documents computer aided diagnosis passing medicine may meet user information need 
user emphasized importance medical terms specifying displayed documents hits tiles 
judging titles displayed restriction useful isolating documents interest 
placing constraints may cause relevant documents discarded interface allows user control tradeoff showing relevant documents showing relevant documents 
implementation notes current method underlying display documents ziff portion trec tipster corpus

critical implementation paragraphs segmentation units substituted result units helpful granularity 
note texttiling run advance entire collection resulting indices stored time retrieval greater standard boolean full text query significantly 
performance issues indexing passages discussed example 
related mentioned information access systems display retrieval results long texts specifically 
hypertext systems address issues related display contents individual documents concerned display contents large number documents response query 
superbook system shows hits query terms structure single large hierarchically structured document handle multiple documents simultaneously show terms multi term query separately display frequencies graphically 
general document content information difficult display existing graphical interface techniques textual information conform expectations sophisticated display paradigms techniques seen information visualizer 
techniques require input structured hierarchical cone tree scalar dimension perspective wall 
aspects document satisfy criteria timeline document creation dates illuminate actual content documents 
graphical interface value bars display relative attribute size set attributes 
example shows window listing file directory contents vertical value bars alongside window scrollbar 
horizontal slice value bar represents size age listed file attributes value bars align directly window contents precluding perception overlap displayed item attributes 
imagine value bars display retrieval results replacing filenames titles retrieved documents having attributes correspond number hits term sets
