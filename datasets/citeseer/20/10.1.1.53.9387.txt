performance individual population depends individual strategies population vary evolutionary process ability individuals selected general cope variety different cases case evolutionary process evolution involved 
generality selection criterion important property general criterion larger number ways satisfying partially greater probability better better solutions evolutionary process 
consider example studied case evolving populations predators prey 
ask evolutionary process catch individual prey may easily fail 
fact prey efficient probability individual randomly generated genotype may able catch low 
consequence individuals scored null value selective process operate 
contrary ask evolutionary process find predator able catch variety different preys probable find individual initial generations able catch select better better individuals predator able catch original individual prey selected 
secondly competing evolutionary systems appealing fitness landscape due changes evolving species potentially useful preventing stagnation local minima 
point view evolution may consequences similar evolving single population changing environment 
environment changes continuously fact coevolving species part environment evolving population 
evolution competing populations may produce increasingly complex evolving challenges 
discussed dawkins krebs competing populations may reciprocally drive increasing levels complexity producing evolutionary arms race 
consider predator prey case success predators implies failure prey conversely preys evolve overcome predators create new challenge 
similarly predators overcome new preys adapting create new challenge preys 
clearly continuation process may produce greater level complexity 
rosin belew point producing pedagogical series challenges gradually increase complexity corresponding solutions :10.1.1.30.3463

consider predators preys case 
evolutionary process predator able catch prey simple behavior easy catch likewise prey able escape simple predators 
populations evolving challenges progressively complex
