important issue generality conversely granularity selected categories 
appropriate consider apply general ideas categorisation choice categories modelling 
discussion draw cognitive psychology linguistics considerable experience modelling method developed ibm 
theory categorisation lakoff presents categorisation fundamental human cognition view argue 
classically holds categorisation complex view hierarchies classes clear common properties membership criteria norm 
theory presents view developed philosophy ludwig wittgenstein research eleanor rosch associates 
lakoff summarises eleven themes relevant discussion described follows basic level categorisation idea categories merely organised hierarchy general specific organized categories cognitively basic middle general specific hierarchy 
generalisation proceeds upward basic level specialisation proceeds downward

note pros cons progressed 
procedure ontology capture section describe detail process went informally defining ontology 
set normative guidelines supposing better approach 
felt worked offer examine consider may useful 
consider phases turn scoping producing definitions review development meta ontology 
scoping brainstorming brain session produce potentially relevant terms phrases stage terms represented concepts concealing serious ambiguities differences opinion 
brainstorming worked insufficient collective domain expertise involved corpus knowledge may need consulted ensure adequate coverage 
grouping structure terms loosely areas corresponding naturally arising sub groups 
case groups arose terms related terms group terms groups 
term ffl provisionally categorise inclusion exclusion borderline determined mainly previously agreed requirements document ffl keep notes record decisions ffl group similar terms potential synonyms consideration 
identify semantic cross areas concepts refer referred concepts areas 
aiai tr page deciding determining meta ontology initially formally commit particular meta ontology 
doing constrain thinking potentially lead inadequate incomplete definitions

careful consideration concepts inter relationships determine requirements meta ontology 
keep mind various possibilities words phrases consistent manner appropriate role entity relationship type instance

areas address area turn

little overlap areas order 
terms define cognitively basic terms area moving specific terms area

produce definitions complete definitions areas 
degree effort considerable variation degree effort required agree definitions terms underlying concepts 
example ffl terms consensus definition single concept fairly easy 
ffl cases terms correspond concept definition 
particular cases commonly terms significantly different informal usage useful different definition agreed 
recorded notes definition 
ffl highly ambiguous terms area identified corresponding closely related different concepts 
situation term gets way shared understanding 
handling ambiguous terms special case term possibly meanings proceeded follows 
suspend term ambiguous 

clarify ideas carefully defining concept technical terms possible meaning agreed consult dictionary 

helpful give definitions meaningless labels conveniently referred 
aiai tr page 
determine concepts important ontology usually 
choose term concept avoiding original ambiguous term possible 
example phenomenon technical terms thing avoid potentially confusing terms entity object 
guidelines cases guidelines followed ffl produce natural language text definition precise possible ffl ensure consistency terms particular ample dictionaries technical glossaries avoid introducing new terms possible ffl indicate relationship commonly terms similar defined synonyms variants referring underlying notion different perspectives ffl definition term intended necessary sufficient far possible natural language 
provide clarification additional information essential understanding definition separate notes definition 
ffl give examples appropriate 
wording text version ontology served specification producing code requirement accessible non technical readers 
achieve appropriate balance technical precision clarity 
kept text definitions relatively informal 
equivalent technically precise definitions cast primitives meta ontology documentation directly accompanying code 
review critically review definitions revising appropriate important decisions previous decisions keep track changes set historical notes 
meta ontology devise meta ontology natural language definitions implicit requirements specification

key points note ffl may possible useful set detailed competency questions main content structure ontology developed 
comprehensive methodology circumstances competency questions clarify purpose drive ontology capture coding stages provide input evaluation phase 
ffl beneficial choose meta ontology allow carefully considered natural language definitions serve implicit requirements meta ontology 
related recommend separating capture coding unduly influenced accidental features formalism 
ffl define cognitively basic terms experience worked 
intuition helped avoid re controlled experiment strong claims regard 
ffl terms get way 
pre conceived ideas term means severely undermine communication prevent agreement proposed definition
