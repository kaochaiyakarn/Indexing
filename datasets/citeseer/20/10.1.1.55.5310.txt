bioinformatics integration simplified kleisli way limsoon wong kent ridge digital labs heng mui keng terrace singapore email limsoon org sg december explosion genomic information fueled engineering technological advances 
amount information grows challenge managing making sense data 
fact biological discovery increasingly performed dry wet paradigm hypotheses formulated analyzing existing data sources subsequently confirmed experiments 
paradigm relies development number tools require advances fundamentals computer science careful engineering 
dry experiments inevitably involve integrating transforming data analyzed mined appropriate software

problems modern bioinformatics involve accessing complex heterogeneous data sources geographically dispersed multiple sequential steps passing information smoothly steps 
simple retrieval data sufficient modern bioinformatics 
rapid growth experimental data order investigate specific biological problem challenge automate process manipulating re structuring information derived various databases 
may require combining data derived multiple public sources local private sources feeding retrieved data various application programs gene finding protein structural prediction functional domain motif identification phylogenetic tree construction procedures require specific input data sets data formats 
observed baker brass existing biology data retrieval systems fully demand flexible painless data integration 
power kleisli comes play 
kleisli powerful data integration system interfaces large number data sources relevant bioinformatics uses self describing data model allow data derived different sources flexibly combined 
partial list data sources adenine org sg publications drivers html biological databases servers internet merely providing interface collection databases analysis software useful requires tedious programming interface case corba 
kleisli goes step provides high level query language called collection programming language cpl elegant mathematical principles 
cpl offers rich data model high level operators express complex queries biology databases analysis software extremely straightforward manner require extensive programming skill 
complicated bioinformatics queries involving multiple databases analysis software multiple steps simple expression cpl efficiently executed kleisli
