kauffman claimed systems ultimately fall prey complexity catastrophes natural selection 
elements system sufficiently independent complexity increases relatively important determining final state system 
case selection pressure weaker mutational pressure population unable maintain position clustered fitness peak individuals population longer show homogeneity advantageous features 
alternatively elements system highly coupled kauffman claims complexity increases features system exhibits due interaction elements 
cases features weakly expressed elements system acting opposition 
adaptive viewpoint harder harder find populations advantageous features complexity system usually works strong expression particular features 
recursive system certain intrinsic invariant properties properties ensure system remains ordered complexity increases 
consider recursive mapping works rule acts single element developing depending rule expressed lead number possibly incomplete phenotypes 
suppose rule splits initial element way 
second stage development elements independently invoke rule perform transformation 
process may continue additional stages development finished phenotype produced 
important point note stage development total number rules invoked stage increase monotonically development 
rule consulted influence development entire phenotype second rules consulted influence development half course simplification atypical circumstances number elements may decrease stage development 
fact affect thrust argument phenotype earliest rules consulted effect final form rules progressively influence 
consider complexity crisis 
increasing complexity system change fact rule invoked stage development earliest rules consulted influence final form phenotype 
increasing complexity change relative interdependence parts system recursive nature system keeps invariant 
population systems selection pressure mutations affect expression earlier rules greater effect mutations affect expression rules 
case selection pressure exceed mutation pressure keeping early development organism stable 
case mutational drift occur allowing population flow peak peak keeping sites effect development intact 
second complexity catastrophe similarly affected recursive nature system 
rule expressed effect final features 
follows rules affect development phenotype 
increasing complexity add extra levels detail picture affect broad brush strokes laid 
terms adaptive systems envisage fractal landscape example koch curve increasing number stages development increases detail system whilst having little effect shape 
effectively landscape moving close possible situation limit point landscape local optima
