formalization multi agent autonomous systems requires rich ontology capturing variety collective behaviours powerful semantics distinguishing collective agents having executing jointly intending plan 
introduce notion social agents social plans 
definition joint intentions provided avoids problems encountered previous formalizations 
particular models cooperation requiring agents adopt joint goal joint plan action forming joint intention 
stresses planning capability agents outlines process means reasoning multiple agents 
situated agents systems embedded dynamic environments continuously sense environment effect changes performing actions 
agents balance time devote thinking time take acting 
need balance need react new situations need continue pursuing long term purposes goals 
critical considerations design situated agents agents resource bounded reason act possibly stringent constraints time information 
bratman bratman intentions agent play crucial role cases

collective mental attitudes joint goals joint intentions includes bratman gilbert grosz sidner levesque searle tuomela miller formalizing joint intention treat collective notion irreducible searle regard joint intention definable terms conjunction individual intentions mutual beliefs intentions individuals grosz sidner levesque tuomela miller example agents want jointly lift heavy table needs individually intend lift table needs believe agent lift 
clearly individual intentions beliefs essential ingredients joint intention note agents form joint intention lift table need share specification lift heavy table jointly 
agents specification combination joint actions jointly intending joint actions 
distinction plan specification plan mental attitude agent committed bringing important grosz sidner litman allen pollack formalism expressible 
call social plan structure corresponds english usage plan called intended plan intention corresponds usage plan 
great variety human joint actions involve hierarchical social organizations 
group agents may consist individual agents groups 
example long table may require agents lift agents ends agents center 
view synchronization required agents 
alternative perspective view task requiring teams lift table agents team ends team centre 
view synchronization requirements involve synchronization actions different teams synchronization team 
capture hierarchical organization agents introducing notion social agent entity denoting collection individual social agents 
joint action group agents involves commitment members group respective parts 
situated agents stringent synchronization conditions required joint actions possibly serious sideeffects arising failed attempts perform action georgeff lansky especially important distinguish successful failed actions 
example agents jointly lifting glass table loses grip table may opportunity task table may agent may able continue holding 
agents need track success failure planned actions inform partners goes wrong

related formalizing joint intention concept joint intention analyzed number researchers philosophical logic bratman gilbert searle tuomela miller ai grosz sidner levesque singh werner tuomela miller tuomela miller grosz sidner grosz sidner regard joint intention definable terms conjunction individual intentions mutual beliefs intentions individuals grosz sidner tuomela miller conditions referred commitment joint activity bratman bratman bratman qualifies individual commitment agents joint activity requiring individual agents coerced adopting joint intention 
gilbert includes similar willingness requirement account joint action gilbert condition illustrated example 
consider example thief trying rob bank teller bank initially intention money 
thief threatens kill teller teller forced give money 
thief intends take money teller teller intends give money mutually believe intentions 
case joint activity transfer money satisfies conditions tuomela miller unreasonable refer joint activity joint intention 
requirement additional condition individual intentions joint activity un coerced 
commitment joint activity necessary sufficient define joint intentions 
searle searle argues cooperation agents necessary condition joint intention 
illustrates mba example searle bratman shall refer condition mutual responsiveness joint goal 
cristiano castelfranchi example scenario mba graduates successfully taught serve humanity pursuing selfish interests 
agent intends serve humanity pursuing interests agent believes mba graduate mutual belief effect definitions tuomela miller grosz sidner mba graduates said joint intention 
searle argues scenario joint intention ideology particular business school accepted graduates joint intention 
levesque levesque address third necessary condition joint intentions commitment communicate private belief success failure joint goal members involved joint activity 
gilbert notes certain obligations flow agent readiness act jointly gilbert bratman refers condition commitment mutual support 
levesque illustrate commitment convoy example 
consider agents driving convoy leading way 
assume drivers satisfy condition committed joint activity 
reasonable say joint intention 
happens driver leading way know directions 
happens driver knows way certain location 
levesque argue cases drivers inform driver success failure achieve joint goal 
sufficient agents just committed joint activity committed communicate beliefs success failure joint goals 
clear conditions discussed sufficient conditions notion joint intention 
searle searle example argues notion joint intention irreducible define necessary conditions joint intention terms individual mental attitudes 
hobbs hobbs searle position language beliefs goals plans disagrees final joint intentions irreducible 
argues notion collective agent need joint intentions related attitude joint goals appropriate mutual beliefs 
hobbs reiterates importance concepts commitment creates mutual belief collective plan responsibility holds agent part complete understanding concept joint intention 
singh singh adopts different approach defining joint intentions explicitly invoke propositional attitudes 
presents theory intentions group agents terms actions done members group agents social structure emerges interactions 
singh theory intentions ascribed observation agent interactions

strategies include individual collective communicative actions agents 
re examine theory joint intentions proposed previous section light issues 
definition provided captures condition joint intention commitment joint activity 
definition stated enforce non coercion individual intentions 
definition thief teller joint intention joint activity transferring money 
straightforward way enforcing non coercion restrict object joint intention joint plan 
restriction say thief teller bank joint intention teller social plan get 
solution somewhat unsatisfactory constitutes coercion non coercion depends plan library agent property intentions 
second condition joint intention mutual responsiveness joint goal follows theorem 
revisiting mba example joint intention serve humanity social agent mba graduates entail joint goal serve humanity 
joint goal obtained form prior communication mba graduates meeting graduation day jointly adopting goal serve humanity
