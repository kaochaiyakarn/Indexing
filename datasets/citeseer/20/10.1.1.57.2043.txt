zhang norman argue differences towers hanoi versions captured identifying rules represented externally problem solving apparatus internally problem solver memory

model defines external representations knowledge structure environment physical symbols objects dimensions external rules constraints relations embedded physical configurations 
goes argue information external representations picked analysed processed perceptual systems 
contrasted internal representations schemata productions retrieved memory 
interesting cognitive tasks zhang terms internal external component say distributed problems consequence problem solving process involves integrating exchanging information representations produce new information 
inference example process example externally represented piece information serves antecedent internally represented conditional rule action

zhang 
hutchins point concretely concludes seen deal computation performed navigation team accomplished processes hand eye ordination task navigation requires internal representations environment traditional cognitive science led expect 
hutchins key zhang firstly appropriate external representations reduce difficulty task supporting recognition memory perceptual judgements recall secondly certain kinds externalisation trigger inappropriate problem solving strategies inferences 
finding developed zhang 
identifies general class displays including alphanumeric graphical tabular displays calls relational information displays rids 
rids displays represent relations information dimensions 
zhang illustrates information dimensions types nominal interval ordinal ratio characteristic properties forming hierarchical structure 
example nominal scales property item categorised different item ordinal scales nominal property plus property item ranked greater 
example desktop display macintosh computer zhang goes compare dimensional properties represented information example file size dimensional properties representing display 
represented information structure categorised terms number dimensions scale types dimension 
classify different types display 
example underlying information structure dimensions ratio nominal represented pie chart bar chart 
zhang goes consider different information structures support general information processing tasks 
example general tasks information retrieval size word file called comparison word file final larger word file 
integration example integrating information breadth depth determine area 
zhang argues task independent way determining best display general principle derived rid framework information perceivable rid exactly match information required task

distinction primary concern logical action choosing menu item physical instantiation action moving mouse cursor particular area screen 
ordination decision logical action take involves bringing different representations processes hutchins describes ordination 
ordination processes discussed great detail hutchins shall term relatively restricted sense 
easy ordinate resources determined part location physical attributes implementation 
example restaurant diner described requires menu memory meals chosen previously order decide meal 
memory previous choices history menu set affordances 
history internal resource affordances external 
process ordination case requires diner read understand menu able recall accurately names previously eaten meals search items menu history 
diner identify smaller set possible choices necessarily single particular choice 
order illustrate ordination return examples discussed previously achieving target speeds adapted hutchins checklist hutchins wright fields 
achieving target speeds ordinating goals states 
hutchins example cockpit speeds described necessary correspondence maintained aircraft speed pilot tend want reduce approach progresses settings flaps extended maintain lift speed reduced 
part process involves knowing target speed flap setting increased necessary notice declining speed reaches target point flap setting adjusted 
ordination processes carried comparison target goal state target speed current state current speed 
order goal current state resources brought ordination precisely happens highly dependent way resources represented 
shows examples goal current state resources may represented support activity case process ordinating resources task relevant comparison different 
knots mach target current state speed target current state fast speed target ordinating goal state resources current target speeds represented pointer speed bug respectively 
process comparison ordination perceptual judgement relative locations pointer speed bug 
current speed represented numeric display line target represented internally remembered pilot 
case process ordination involves ability pilot read display interpret employing knowledge decimal numerals comparison remembered target speed determine remembered speed higher lower 
current target speed values represented numerical form flight deck display allowing pilot explicit ordination similar case difference values read interpreted represented pilot memory
