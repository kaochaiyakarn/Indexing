transformation learning technique introduced eric brill shown part speech tagging fairly high accuracy 
method applied higher level textual interpretation locating chunks tagged text including non recursive basenp chunks 
purpose convenient view chunking tagging problem encoding chunk structure new tags attached word 
automatic tests treebank derived data technique achieved recall precision rates roughly basenp chunks trained words somewhat complex chunks partition sentence trained words 
working new application larger template training sets required interesting adaptations transformation learning approach 

text chunking involves dividing sentences nonoverlapping segments basis fairly superficial analysis 
abney proposed useful relatively tractable precursor full parsing provides foundation levels analysis including verb argument lance ramshaw mitchell marcus identification allowing complex attachment decisions postponed phase 
chunking includes identifying nonrecursive portions noun phrases useful purposes including index term generation 
efforts superficially extracting segments sentences focused identifying low level noun groups hand built grammars finite state techniques statistical models hmms trained corpora 
target somewhat higher level chunk structure brill transformation learning mechanism sequence transformational rules learned corpus sequence iteratively improves baseline model interpretive feature text 
technique previously part speech tagging brill prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation brill resnik assigning unlabeled binary branching tree structure sentences brill 
transformation learning uses pattern action rules selected features local context helpful values predicted encoded locally 
text chunking application encoding predicted chunk structure tags attached words brackets words avoids difficulties unbalanced bracketings result local rules allowed insert alter inter word brackets directly 
study training test sets marked different types chunk structure derived algorithmically parsed data penn treebank corpus wall street journal text marcus 
source texts run brill part speech tagger brill baseline heuristic chunk structure tags assigned word part speech tag 
rules automatically learned updated chunk structure tags neighboring words part speech chunk tags 
applying learning text chunking turns different interesting ways part speech tagging 
larger template sets training corpora required different algorithmic optimizations 

text chunking abney proposed text chunking useful preliminary step parsing 
chunks inspired part psychological studies gee link pause durations reading naive sentence text groupings called oe phrases roughly correspond breaking string syntactic head content word 
abney motivation chunking procedural text chunking transformation learning hypothesis identification chunks done fairly finite state methods postponing decisions require higher level analysis parsing phase chooses combine chunks 

existing chunk identification techniques existing efforts identifying chunks text focused primarily low level noun group identification frequently step deriving index terms motivated part limited coverage parsers dealing unrestricted text 
researchers applied grammar methods combining lexical data finite state grammar constraints worked inducing statistical models directly words automatically assigned part speech classes 
grammar side bourigault describes system extracting terminological noun phrases french text 
system uses heuristics find maximal length noun phrases uses grammar extract terminological units 
example maximal np le dur de la station de travail extracts terminological phrases dur station de travail 
bourigault claims grammar parse maximal length noun phrases test corpus possible terminological phrases require manual validation 
goal terminological phrases appears system ignores np chunk initial determiners initial prenominal modifiers somewhat simplifying parsing task 
voutilainen impressive system uses approach ways similar adds part speech tags new kind tag shows chunk structure chunk tag example determiners premodifiers group noun head 
uses lexicon lists possible chunk tags word combined hand built constraint grammar patterns 
patterns eliminate impossible readings identify somewhat idiosyncratic kind target noun group include initial determiners include prepositional phrases including determiners 
voutilainen claims recall rates better precision better 
sample analysis voutilainen includes appendix appears accurate claimed general apparent mistakes unresolved ambiguity np chunks sample listed table 
nature suggests definition np chunk tuned extracting terminological phrases excludes kinds np premodifiers simplifying chunking lance ramshaw mitchell marcus task

statistical methods church parts program addition identifying parts speech inserted brackets identifying core nps 
brackets placed statistical model trained brown corpus material np brackets inserted semi automatically 
small test sample shown system achieved recall correct brackets

running church program test material reveals definition np embodied church program include example structures words conjoined np explicit conjunctions implicitly commas 
church chunker assigns np chunk structures ill subsidiary newer big selling prescriptions drugs inefficiency waste lack coordination difficult compare performance figures studies definitions target chunks evaluation methodologies differ widely frequently incompletely specified 
cited performance figures appear derive manual checks investigators text chunking transformation learning system predicted output hard estimate impact system suggested chunking judge determination 
believe reported study attempted find np chunks subject limitation structures recognized include recursively embedded nps measured performance automatic comparison corpus 

deriving chunks treebank parses performed experiments different chunk structure targets tried bracket non recursive partitioned sentences non overlapping type type chunks loosely abney model 
training test materials chunk tags encoding kinds structure derived automatically parsed wall street journal text penn treebank marcus 
automatic derivation process introduced small percentage errors practical way provide amount training data required allow fully automatic testing 
goal basenp chunks identify essentially initial portions non recursive noun phrases head including determiners including prepositional phrases clauses 
chunks extracted treebank parses basically selecting nps contained nested nps handling conjunction followed treebank annotators show separate single basenp spanning conjunction treated special case viewing possessive marker word new basenp flattening recursive structure useful way

example treebank uses label nac nps functioning premodifiers bank england robin leigh pemberton bank england governor conceded cases governor included basenp chunk 
non constituent np conjunction treebank labels nx example causes problems 
lance ramshaw mitchell marcus smaller non communist parties chunks partitioning chunk experiments somewhat closer abney model prepositions prepositional phrases included object np head single type chunk 
created substantial additional ambiguity system distinguish prepositions particles 
handling conjunction follows treebank parse nominal conjuncts parsed treebank single np forming single chunk parsed conjoined nps separate chunks coordinating conjunctions attached prepositions chunk

indexing static rule elements earlier transformational part speech tagging ramshaw marcus noted possible greatly speed learning process constructing full bidirectional index linking candidate rule locations corpus applies location corpus candidate rules apply 
index allows process applying rules performed having search corpus 
unfortunately complete indexing proved costly terms physical memory feasible application 
possible construct limited index lists candidate rule locations corpus static portions left hand side pattern match 
index involves stable word identity part speech tag values require updating stored compactly necessary main lance ramshaw mitchell marcus tain back pointers corpus locations applicable rules 
kind partial static index proved significant advantage portion program candidate rules relatively high positive scores tested determine negative scores avoids necessity testing rules location corpus 

heuristic disabling rules investigated new heuristic speed computation pass disable rules positive score significantly lower net score best rule current pass 
disabled rule changes corpus possible score rule changed bring back contention top place 
done adding fraction changes pass positive scores disabled rules rules adjusted positive scores came threshold net score successful rule pass 
note heuristic technique introduces risk missing actual best rule pass due incorrectly disabled time 
empirical comparisons runs rule disabling suggest conservative technique produce order magnitude speedup imposing slight cost terms suboptimality resulting learned rule sequence
