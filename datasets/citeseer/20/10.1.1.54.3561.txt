overview statistical science section briefly describes central statistical ideas think relevant data mining 
rigorous survey statistics mathematically inclined reader see example schervish 
reasons space ignore number interesting topics including time series analysis meta analysis 
probability distributions 
statistical literature contains mathematical characterizations wealth probability distributions properties random variables functions defined events probability measure assigns values 
important relations probability distributions include marginalization summing subset values conditionalization forming statistical themes lessons data mining conditional probability measure measure sample space event positive measure 
essential relations random variables include independence conditional independence various measures dependence famous correlation coefficient 
statistical literature characterizes families distributions properties useful identifying particular member family data closure properties useful model construction inference example conjugate families closed conditionalization family closed linear combination 
knowledge properties distribution families invaluable analyzing data making appropriate inferences 
estimation consistency uncertainty assumptions robustness model averaging 
estimator function sample data value parameter 
data comprise sample larger actual potential collection governed probability distribution family estimators corresponding possible samples collection probability distribution 
classical statistics investigates distributions estimators order establish basic properties reliability uncertainty 
variety resampling simulation techniques exist assessing estimator uncertainty efron tibshirani 
estimation requires set assumptions 
assumptions typically false useful 
model think set assumptions incorrect estimates expected incorrect 
aims statistical research find ways weaken assumptions necessary estimation 
robust statistics huber looks estimators satisfactorily larger families distributions small errors assumptions violated 
bayesian estimation emphasizes alternative models competing assumptions plausible 
making estimate single model models considered estimate obtained weighted average estimates individual models madigan raftery 
fact bayesian model averaging bound improve predictive performance average 
models obtained data mining usually results automated search procedure accounting potential errors associated search crucial 
practice requires monte carlo analysis 
impression error rates search procedures proposed data mining statistical literature far rarely estimated way 
see spirtes monte carlo test design search procedures 
hypothesis testing 
statistical tests widely important limitations noted 
viewed sided estimation method hypothesis testing inconsistent alpha level testing rule decreased appropriately sample size increases 
generally ff level test hypothesis ff level test hypothesis jointly provide ff level test conjunction hypotheses 
special cases rules glymour madigan pregibon smyth times called contrasts exist simultaneously testing hypotheses miller 
important corollary data mining ff level test directly probability error search procedure involves testing series hypothesis 
example pair set variables hypotheses independence tested ff probability erroneously finding dependent set variables fact pairs independent 
data mining procedures sequence hypothesis tests alpha level tests generally taken estimate error probability related outcome search 
data miners note error probabilities tests truth hypotheses connection somewhat see section 
hypotheses excellent approximations may rejected large samples tests linear models example typically reject large samples matter closely fit data 
model scoring 
evidence provided data lead prefer models hypotheses indifferent models 
score rule maps models data numbers numerical ordering corresponds preference ordering space models data 
reasons just considered scoring rules attractive alternative tests 
typical rules assign models value determined likelihood function associated model number parameters dimension model data 
popular rules include akaike information criterion akaike bayes information criterion raftery minimum description length rissanen 
prior probability distribution models posterior probability data scoring function arguably privileged 
bayes information criterion approximates posterior probabilities large samples 
notion consistency appropriate scoring rules large sample limit surely true model receiving maximal scores 
aic scores general consistent schwartz 
uncertainties associated scores different samples size distribution may yield different numerical values model different orderings models 
obvious combinatorial reasons impossible searching large model space calculate scores models feasible describe calculate scores equivalence classes models receiving highest scores 
contexts inferences bayesian scores differ great deal inferences hypothesis tests 
raftery gives examples models account variance outcome interest high bayesian scores overwhelmingly rejected statistical tests 
markov chain monte carlo 
historically insurmountable computational difficulties forced data analysts eschew exact analysis elaborate hierarchical bayesian models complex likelihood calculations 
dramatic advances monte carlo methods liberated analysts con statistical themes lessons data mining straints 
particular class simulation methods dubbed markov chain monte carlo originally developed statistical mechanics revolutionized practice bayesian statistics 
smith roberts provide accessible overview bayesian perspective gilks 
provide practical addressing bayesian non bayesian perspectives 
simulation methods may unacceptably slow faced massive data sets
