techniques assume relevant information discovery gathered assembled single table database 
multiple databases possible combine features perspectives move confines ontology fixed designers single database 
introduce world worldwide relational learning daemon system uses spreading activation enable inductive learning multiple tables multiple databases spread network 
describe paradigm system provide demonstrations synthetic data sets replicate real world successes automated discovery 
inductive machine learning offers methods discovering new knowledge business medical scientific databases 
need learn multiple tables realized inductive learning data mining techniques assume relevant information discovery gathered assembled single table database 
multiple tables multiple databases possible combine features perspectives move confines ontology fixed designers single database 
addition highly interesting novel relationships exist databases motivated inquiry place 
unfortunately combining multiple databases requires substantial knowledge engineering coalesce relevant information multiple tables databases 
requires domain expert determine databases fields relevant 
combining multiple databases creates scaling problems discovery programs 
begun address problem learning multiple databases requires databases reside machine 
practice useful databases may exist remote locations organization internet case existence may known persons initiating inquiry 
world system described inductive rule learning program learn multiple databases distributed network 
demonstrates databases codified purposes introduce open framework induction program operates 
long term goal reduce effort needed knowledge discovery databases designing inductive systems locate new databases contain information relevant current discovery task utilize information seamlessly augmenting inductive process 
distributed learning key world ability treat multiple databases transparently spreading activation item item matching basic operation inductive engine 
methods works labelling item marker gamma items concept interest complement propagating markers databases looking values positive negative markers accumulate 
process span databases possibly different machines

bob tim mary john sam jaguar new york los angeles new castle pittsburgh bmw equivalent simple network 
world inductive algorithm identical style rule learners specifically rl program matching portion algorithm replaced spreading activation collection counting markers 
consider representation attribute values represented pointers space values different type pointer different attribute 
testing possibilities characterize set world places class marker data item

people name city car sam pittsburgh john pittsburgh bob new castle bmw tim los angeles bmw mary new york jaguar cities city state pittsburgh pennsylvania new castle pennsylvania los angeles california new york new york table relational database 
joining databases consider table database shown 
traditional approach domain engineer thought state relevant attribute discovery problem join tables column city adding additional information data set 
subsequently standard learner find state pennsylvania perfectly characterizes concept 
problems constructing joins advance obvious suggestion 
constructing possible joins create universal relation require huge amount space particularly newly joined tables connected 
second resulting space predicates test huge cover space values field 
third distributed environment target tables may maintained network pointers remote databases may point foreign databases 
importantly process creating relevant joins manually time effort consuming prone errors omission subject bias errors commission effort fixed advance 
bob tim mary john sam pittsburgh new castle los angeles new york jaguar bmw pennsylvania california new york equivalent table network 
spreading activation method need create single join 
consider alternate conceptual representation 
tables represented common linked structure 
markers propagated multiple links possible 
diagram shows result process positive markers accumulated pennsylvania unifying concept original set 
basic learning operation searching predicates encouraging statistics respect coverage positive negative examples performed multiple databases straight forward manner 
world system operations marker propagation accumulation implemented basic database operations relational algebra common aggregate operations 
propagates markers database join operation add relevant columns new table positive negative counts 
accumulations markers counted projecting column counting markers value column summation operator 
design choice facilitate learning existing databases query engine 
unexpectedly direct implementation marker propagation efficient may require database format conversions 
important feature approach assumption databases reside machine 
markers spread columns database collected tallied sent databases look additional connections deeper relational structure 
implementation markers propagated databases stream data 
stream transmitted regular network link process continued seamlessly machine 
database additional information column specifying network local machine look potential joins similar links world wide web 
www need master map entire structure database links network followed encountered 
extensions natural extensions world basic process 
limited relational databases 
spreading activation learning methodology hierarchical background knowledge naturally 
classifications objects represented isa links 
markers propagated unifying concepts consist classes individual values 
second isa hierarchies include complex inheritance structures 
describe system isa hierarchies role structures nonmonotonic inheritance 
limit number joins method accomodate 
markers passed database potentially relevant relationships cause domain engineer consider join 
markers filtered distribution values new column tallied passed databases joined new column 
process continues long additional databases joined 
limits may placed extent spreading example limiting number joins strength semantic links horizon effect stopping arbitrary limits may overcome continuing joins long pathway looks promising judged number distribution markers values 
experiments designed class synthetic data sets evaluate world system 
goal demonstrate system discover rules re quired linking multiple databases machines support contention coalescing multiple databases single machine single table necessary order standard rule learning approach effective 
distributed relevant features concepts discovered multiple tables monolithic distributed platforms 
show tables structured relationally discovery problems 
links represent joins 
case tables stored single machine machines local network 
world successfully discovered target concepts case 
incidentally factor speedup parallelism case

demonstration replicated results automated knowledge discovery real world domains 
experiment reproduced clinically relevant botanical toxicology discovery precursor world learns complex inheritance networks 
linked database poison plant exposures databases geographical climate data order explain interesting class terms basic environmental principles 
remember world functionally equivalent style rule learner learning biases incorporate 
able replicate discovery need manually link databases single inheritance network 
second replication world successfully reproduced previously known concept definitions identify high risk pneumonia patients 
system described allows database maintainers link databases network learning 
world system uses local links foreign databases follow series links databases network 
achieve long range goal autonomous learning databases distributed world wide web significant problems need solved 
significant problems world system reliance set manually constructed maintained links databases assumption standardized vocabulary heterogeneous databases
