case reasoning 
case reasoning cbr approach develop knowledge systems able retrieve reuse solutions worked similar situations past 
sounds simple deserves explanations prerequisites essential steps differences compared approaches building knowledge systems 
important prerequisite collection experiences embodied called cases stored case base 
single case consists problem description part called problem solution description part called solution 
basic ingredients usually enriched administrative part including case number explanation justification part provides information step problem solution context description part evaluation part contains information quality reusability case 
may attachments format multi media computer equipment able record view play 
addition case base may general knowledge form models rules constraints available 
case base general knowledge constitute partial domain model consequence general cbr closed world assumption hold 
problem solving cbr proceeds follows new problem comes existence described problem part new case called query 
old cases containing problems similar new problem retrieved suitable solutions suggested solution new problem 
solution tested reality may lead revised solution worth stored new case
