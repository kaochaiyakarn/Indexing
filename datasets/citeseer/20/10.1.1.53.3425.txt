section explain basic concepts matching algorithm compares sets maxima assigns matching value represents similarity actual boundaries objects 
complete description css matching algorithm see 
consider objects 
regions object matched regions second object respectively 
looking locations relevant maxima second row realize quite different positions 
due different starting points 
change starting point properly locations corresponding maxima css images near
