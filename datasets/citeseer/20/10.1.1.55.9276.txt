extraction text categorization 
extraction patterns information extraction natural language processing task received growing attention years largely due message understanding conferences muc proceedings muc proceedings muc proceedings 
systems extract domain specific information natural language text 
domain types information extracted defined advance 
systems focus object identification people places companies physical objects 
example muc terrorism domain involved extraction perpetrators victims physical targets weapons dates locations muc proceedings 
muc joint ventures domain required extraction companies people monetary values facilities associated joint ventures muc proceedings 
systems form partial parsing recognize local syntactic constructs generating complete parse tree sentence 
systems usually applied large sets real documents robustness provided partial parsing essential cope unknown words ungrammatical ill formed text 
domain specific extraction patterns similar identify relevant information 
important aspect information extraction paradigm irrelevant information ignored 
extraction patterns apply sentence extracted 
consequently irrelevant paragraphs documents processed quickly 
experiments article done conceptual sentence analyzer called circus lehnert 
circus uses case frames extract information refer case frames extraction patterns purposes noted circus case frames describe 
extraction pattern indexed trigger word contains set activating conditions case roles slots 
trigger word lexical item indexes extraction patterns indexed words trigger sentence containing trigger words processed 
ellen riloff jeffrey lorenzen pattern activating conditions additional constraints satisfied pattern applied 
intuitively extraction pattern represents linguistic expressions defined trigger word activating conditions 
example consider sentence terrorists retaliation attempted kill car bombs 
terrorism domain want extract items sentence perpetrators terrorists victims weapons car bombs 
extraction patterns job perpetrator 
attempted kill attempted kill victim 
kill weapon 
extraction pattern triggered word kill activating conditions check kill infinitive form preceded verb attempted 
conditions satisfied subject verb attempted extracted perpetrator 
note pattern extracts terrorists subject verb attempted phrase retaliation physically separates 
refer case frames patterns important remember extracting information depends syntactic processing 
simply extracting adjacent words 
second extraction pattern trigger word kill activating conditions extracts object kill victim 
patterns represent expression attempted kill merged single case frame slots perpetrator victim 
assume pattern just single slot extract piece information 
third extraction pattern triggered word kill activating conditions check kill infinitive form followed preposition 
object preposition extracted weapon 
note adjacent kill simply follow clause 
example illustrates natural language processing capabilities 
extraction pattern essentially telling system attach prepositional phrase containing preposition verb kill 
may words prepositional phrase attachment point simply searching adjacent words 
types extraction patterns currently recognized system extraction text categorization shown

extraction pattern types systems extraction patterns domain interest defined hand 
tedious time consuming process 
muc terrorism domain estimated took approximately define extraction patterns 
fortunately systems developed generate extraction patterns automatically semi automatically training data kim moldovan soderland huffman including autoslog system riloff 
autoslog constructed dictionary extraction patterns muc terrorism domain achieved performance hand crafted patterns 
autoslog uses annotated texts training human manually review resulting extraction patterns 
manual review process typically fast took hours review terrorism patterns need annotated training texts serious knowledge engineering bottleneck 
section describe new version autoslog called autoslog ts generates domain specific extraction patterns relevant irrelevant sample texts annotations 
autoslog ts system generate extraction patterns raw text input 
ellen riloff jeffrey lorenzen 
relevancy signatures extraction patterns represent local linguistic expressions slightly sophisticated keywords 
extraction patterns depend syntactic contexts surrounding word 
example extraction patterns triggered word bomb recognize active verb form bomb infinitive verb form bomb noun form bomb 
prepositions important patterns identify role relationships 
example killed suggests perpetrator killed suggests weapon 
shown recognizing different verb forms prepositions dramatically improve accuracy classification terms riloff 
linguistic expressions recognized extraction pattern represented signature 
signature simply extraction pattern paired trigger word 
example signature pairs activating conditions trigger bombed represent phrases bombed bombed bombed 
similarly signature pairs active verb activating conditions trigger word bombed represent expressions bombed bombed 
signature concise representation linguistic expressions recognized instantiated extraction pattern 
signatures useful classification 
example terrorism domain need signatures refer death people killed terrorist attacks 
people killed ways accidents military incidents random violence 
consequently signatures representing expressions killed died particularly helpful identifying terrorism texts 
find useful classification terms need identify signatures representative domain 
refer signatures relevancy signatures 
intuitively relevancy signatures represent expressions common domain 
conditional probability estimate find relevancy signatures domain 
training corpus consisting relevant irrelevant sample texts generate probability estimates 
procedure 
run sentence analyzer training corpus extraction patterns developed domain 
keep track signatures generated text 

signature compute conditional probability text relevant contains signature 
simply number times signature appeared relevant texts divided total number times signature appeared training corpus 
clarity refer conditional probability relevance extraction text categorization rate signature 

select set relevancy signatures specifying thresholds minimum acceptable relevance rate minimum acceptable frequency value 
example means signature relevancy signature occurred times training corpus occurrences appeared relevant texts 
set relevancy signatures identified domain classification procedure simple 
new texts classify run sentence analyzer texts extraction patterns record signatures generated text 
relevancy signatures text text classified relevant 
relevancy signatures text classified irrelevant 
note takes single relevancy signature classify text relevant 
text relevancy signature considered just relevant text relevancy signatures 
approach different information retrieval algorithms rank texts multiple indexing terms turtle croft salton 
reasons approach 
muc terrorism domain defined text passing terrorist incident relevant 
muc corpus contains texts relevant single sentence refers terrorist attack 
humans little trouble classifying texts relevant usually obvious terrorist attack reasoned system able 
second justification approach doing text categorization query information retrieval 
text categorization texts need ranked just classified relevant irrelevant 
text accurately classified produce results 
example suppose large text collection contains relevant texts ir system ranks near top near bottom 
query scenario user quickly sees relevant documents system probably perceived working 
text classification scenario system misclassified relevant documents 
domain task play significant role deciding approach best 
performed experiments classify texts multiple signatures get consistently better results single signature approach riloff 
reason single signature approach effective signatures capture linguistic context 
illustrate power notion constitutes terrorism separate issue explained muc guidelines muc proceedings 
ellen riloff jeffrey lorenzen signatures keywords suppose set 
find relevancy signatures terrorism domain generated training corpus muc texts 
lists terrorism relevancy signatures statistics 
intuitively signatures represent expressions associated terrorism logical wonder trigger words just effective 
righthand side show trigger words respective statistics generated training corpus considering surrounding linguistic context

relevancy signatures trigger word statistics terrorism triggers shot death went effective 
trigger words substantially lower relevance rates respective signatures 
particular signatures contain preposition generally higher correlation relevant texts corresponding trigger words 
believe objects preposition date expressions 
example murder usually refers murder specific date 
preposition helps distinguish specific murder incidents general murder murder increasing nation 
words represent phrases treated lexical items circus 
phrases part phrasal lexicon hand crafted muc terrorism domain 
left system hand crafted extraction patterns need removing put automatically generated extraction patterns disadvantage compare patterns section 
retrospect expect autoslog ts generated extraction patterns recognize expressions 
extraction text categorization infinitive form protest strongly correlated terrorism word protest 
examples multiple domains different verb forms different prepositions verb dramatically change effectiveness classification terms riloff 

augmented relevancy signatures signatures powerful individual words represent local syntactic context major limitation include role fillers 
signature may represent verb expectation prepositional phrase represent object prepositional phrase 
domains role fillers critical 
example muc terrorism domain defined victim terrorist act civilian 
terrorist group attacks military personnel terrorists act classified terrorism 
sentence terrorists killed shoppers relevant sentence terrorists killed soldiers

intuitively want classify text relevant contains relevant key phrase relevant role filler 
augmented relevancy signatures algorithm riloff lehnert relevancy signatures relevant slot triples 
triples form event type slot type feature generated automatically extracted role filler 
feature corresponds semantic feature associated head noun role filler 
example suppose word terrorists tagged terrorist feature dictionary word soldiers tagged military feature 
sentence armed terrorists killed soldiers yield signatures representing expressions subject 
killed killed dobj slot triples representing terrorists murder perpetrator terrorist soldiers murder victim military 
augmented relevancy signatures algorithm analogous relevancy signatures algorithm operate signatures slot triples 
training collect signatures slot triples generated extraction patterns text 
compute relevance rate conditional probability frequency slot triple addition signature 
choose sets thresholds signatures triples identify set relevancy signatures set relevant slot triples 
shows relevant slot triples identified thresholds 
slot triples illustrate semantic properties ellen riloff jeffrey lorenzen domain
