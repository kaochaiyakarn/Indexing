notation 
basic ontology situation theory consists entities finite cognitive agent discriminates way world 
entities known uniformities include ffl individuals objects agent single essentially unitary items denoted ffl relations uniformities hold link specific numbers certain uniformities denoted ffl spatial locations necessarily points mathematical spaces spatial extension denoted ffl temporal locations spatial locations temporal locations may points time regions time denoted ffl situations structured parts concrete world agent denoted ffl types higher order uniformities denoted scheme individuation way carving world uniformities essential aspect situation theory 
agent relative framework picks ontology 
words basic constituents theory determined agent scheme individuation 
situation theory information taken information situation form discrete items 
infons discrete items information situations class objects describe limited portions real world 
infons denoted ae place relation objects appropriate respective argument places polarity assigned sequence polarity value respectively indicates objects respectively stand relation place relation am objects appropriate argument places filling argument places sufficient satisfy minimality conditions am ae defined infon 
minimality conditions collection conditions determine particular groups argument roles need filled order produce infon 
infon said saturated 
infon oe situation write oe indicate infon oe factual oe item information true said supports oe
