ideally homepages maintained author publisher lieu may created individual basis 
homepages provide representation purposes active notebook offering html point annotated attached html documents annotation assigned concepts active notebook described section 
homepages non html documents easily created html form users include minimal information return homepage add information 
order active notebook useful tool needs extremely easy users add documents notes notebook 
implemented simple techniques adding documents including drag drop interface prompts user concepts 
interface includes simple editor online creation new notes accepts text files dropped compatible drag source file manager mail tool editing program 
defaults selected title url new document information parsed document 
second command line interface program may backend scripting command 
developing set emacs keyboard macros facilitate adding documents active notebook 
interfaces share common code base provides preprocessing documents added notebook 
mail messages example processed software creates attractive threaded html archive number standard mail messages 
calendar appointments included mail messages placed user calendar sun calendar manager supported underway support ical 
calendar appointments extended url mail message placed user active notebook user get appointment extended description topic 
web tools storing documents easy share documents 
facilities active notebook interface easy create new groups users share documents create members selected group 
annotation proxy server sure display annotations users members groups view annotation 
second level protection provided permission settings underlying document files access control documents placed directories server control access files 
user choose browsing authorized groups member focus set displayed annotations documents interest topic hand 
introduce standard interfaces sharing documents think read introduced default priority concept choose todo list 
document note structuring tools provide useful array services real benefit active notebook comes semantic organization concepts assigned documents user 
assigning concepts document user active notebook assigned concepts 
concepts simply phrases composed words describe document importance user 
concepts presumed topic category descriptions 
concept example research organization tool 
concepts arranged user taxonomy expressing semantic subsumption relationships concepts described section 
author active notebook months various stages development organizing information available web 
active notebook currently contains documents includes different concepts 
entry active notebook example contains information url www edu title home page concepts science museum education problem storing concepts free text way concepts effectively may stored different ways 
happen capitalized differently stored graphics software graphics software minor morphological variants tool tools 
implemented solution problem applies canonical title capitalization concepts stored query 
working bill woods incorporate genuine morphological analysis handle second problem 
user structured taxonomy user taxonomy expresses semantic subsumption relationships concepts describe document active notebook 
example taxonomy includes facts computer kind information processing device commerce kind business activity stored relationships semantic network computer child information processing device example 
parent child relation represents deliberate conflation instance kind find types concepts practice system usable semantic distinction enforced 
facts assumed implicitly system multi word concepts assumed kind class named component words 
information processing device parents information processing device 
algorithm introduces strange axioms general effect positive bad axioms manually deleted active notebook taxonomy editor 
authors agenda identify benefits allowing individual users structure personal taxonomy hierarchy categories 
time substantial effort spent designing broadly useful taxonomies cyc wordnet standards kif ontolingua sharing knowledge different users applications 
find personal information organization needs personalized taxonomy provides distinct advantages may worth exploring extent knowledge represented user relatively unstructured taxonomy may provide basis formal knowledge representations 
personal taxonomy contain greater levels detail areas represent parts world user finer distinctions 
taxonomy example significant distinctions concept software taxonomy designed person professional field distinctions 
conveniently user perspective changes time previously monolithic categories split finer distinctions active notebook includes interface collections documents en masse 
problems handled globally consistent taxonomy minimized avoided personal taxonomy 
individuals words concepts sense strictly speaking different senses word 
happens people frequently domain vocabulary constrains sense mean 
taxonomy wordnet include senses word point user senses taxonomy appear simpler unused senses excluded 
despite simplification introduced restricting taxonomy single user occurrences multiple word senses problem 
taxonomy example discovered concept property refer properties object real estate 
browsing taxonomy user may notice surprising conflation documents reflecting multiple word concept 
cases group reclassification interface provide allows user split word independent senses relocate senses appropriate set parents select child belongs sense needs split similar lines 
activity postponed presence multiple senses taxonomy problem user 
working develop techniques automatically recognizing situations reflect multiple word senses comparing word usage separate taxonomy wordnet direct analysis relationships existing taxonomy 
considerations greatly simplify taxonomy function single user desirable relevant pieces taxonomies constructed users user purposes 
address considerations section taxonomy sharing 
browsing retrieval active notebook taxonomy performs important function clustering documents semantically related classes 
document user click concepts describe document browse sorted list related documents 
related documents selected having assigned concept subsumed currently browsed concept taxonomy 
sorted user specified criteria default algorithm employs normal library order ignoring articles 
view document subcollection provides intuitive semantic clustering related documents display allowing user browse related documents 
display shows document list concepts explicitly classified provide way rapidly browse taxonomy searching related document subcollections 
document instantly retrieved clicking title web browser 
document retrieved original url document updated network source location user retrieve latest version 
document footer interface including user assigned concepts personal group annotations automatically appended annotation proxy server 
taxonomy sharing despite emphasis personal taxonomy development taxonomy recognize benefit able share taxonomic facts primarily allow user benefit classification 
keeping personal taxonomy fundamental semantic structure active notebook identify ways taxonomic facts shared 
inheritance facts shared taxonomy 
taxonomies concepts representing categories relevant group laboratory field maintained separate servers 
developing protocols user taxonomy subscribe inherit number taxonomies bear multiple inheritance relationship general taxonomies turn 
modelled notion multiple inheritance modern object oriented languages distributed suite taxonomy servers provide facts relationship new concepts previously categorized ones 
implemented taxonomy server responds socket connection requests return lists documents subsumed concept compute return semantic relationship pair concepts modify taxonomy adding concepts documents 
server connect copies program implementing higher level taxonomies interface cascade request general taxonomy may able handle current 
continuing resolve conflicts represent dependencies inherited taxonomic facts tracked case higher level taxonomy changed 
working define methods user export part personal taxonomy higher level shared taxonomy 
second way sharing taxonomic facts direct import user taxonomy 
user shares document example try classify taxonomy concepts assigned 
concepts taxonomy taxonomy server may ask taxonomy server explain relationships represented concepts reaches concepts taxonomy server knows 
provides candidate default addition taxonomy issues remain resolved proposed implementation 
active reminding longer term address active reminding 
active reminding technique computer system understanding current topic conversation focus attention actively suggest relevant pieces information user active notebook 
composing new document example natural language techniques may applied partial document trying identify important concepts syntactic semantic constraints 
concepts classified user personal active notebook user may reminded highly relevant documents number passive active channels 
channel separate window user screen configured change fairly infrequently disturb user composition process 
meeting presentation additional tools developing help computers specially equipped conference room continual text representation topic conversation 
extent accurately extracted speech written typed discourse participants actively reminded relevant documents personal active notebooks online meeting 
may prompt share interesting example 
new age information organization 
balance information available machine readable formats switch information management powerful tools 
applying semantic processing unrestricted domains problematic 
providing convenient user interface simple robust underlying representation concepts hope maintaining personal taxonomy useful tool information organization
