moving belief goal intention worlds amounts successively pruning paths time tree intuitively making increasingly selective choices actions

essentially states agent goal proposition believes matter world turns option eventually achieving goal 
agent may contemplate possible failure way believes eventually recover failures ultimately achieve goals

strong modeling rational agents 
call constraint strong realism rao georgeff realism constraint linear time intention logic proposed cohen levesque weakened constraint requires intersection belief worlds non empty world common belief goal accessible worlds
