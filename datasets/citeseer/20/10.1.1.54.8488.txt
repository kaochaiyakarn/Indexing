approach strong points provide satisfactory account adherence discourse conventions dialogue 
instance consider simple phenomena question typically followed answer explicit statement inability refusal answer 
intentional story account goes follows 
production question agent agent recognizes agent goal find answer adopts goal tell answer order operative 
plans achieve goal generating answer 
provides elegant account simple case requires strong assumption 
agent adopt agent goals 
result explain says know answer adopting goals 
approaches suggested account behavior 
litman allen introduced intentional analysis discourse level addition domain level assumed set conventional multi agent actions discourse level 
tried account kind behavior social intentional constructs joint intentions cohen levesque shared plans grosz sidner 
accounts help explain discourse phenomena satisfactorily require strong degree account dialogue coherence provide easy explanations agent act cases support high level mutual goals 
consider stranger approaching agent asking time 
joint intention shared plan met 
purely strategic point view agent may interest stranger goals met 
typically agents respond situations 
example consider case agent goals prefers interrogating agent find requested information 
block intention inform inspires agent respond 
examples illustrate account question answering go recognition speaker intentions 
questions just provide evidence speaker goals adoption goals interlocutor involved formulating response question 
researchers mann kowtko assume library discourse level actions called dialogue games encode common communicative interactions 
operative agent participating games 
question asked fixed number activities introduced question operative responses 
games provide better explanation coherence require agents recognize intentions perform dialogue game 
result viewed special case intentional view 
interesting model described separates conversational games task related games way similar way litman allen 
separation assume operation tasks agent performing require recognition intention cooperation conversational level 
left unexplained goals motivate conversational operation 
problem systems impose form automatic goal adoption impossible reason cases want violate rules especially cases conversational operation conflict agent personal goals 
developing alternate approach takes step back strong plan approach 
strong plan account mean models set personal goals directly motivates behavior agent 
intuitions underlying approaches close right claim mistake attempt analyze behavior arising entirely agent high level goals 
believe people complex set motivations action 
particular behavior arises sense obligation behave limits set society agent part 
model obligations differs intention approach obligations independent shared plans intention recognition 
obligations result rules agent lives 
social interactions enabled sufficient compatibility rules affecting interacting agents 
responds question social behavior strongly encouraged grows agent 
sketch solution model propose agent behavior determined number factors including agent current goals domain set obligations induced set social conventions 
planning agent considers goals obligations order determine action addresses extent possible 
prior intentions obligations conflict agent generally delay pursuit intentions order satisfy obligations agent may behave cost violating obligations 
time agent may obligations different goals planning involves complex tradeoff different factors 
returning example questions agent asked question creates obligation respond 
agent adopt goal answering question personal goals order explain behavior 
constraint actions agent may plan 
fact agent explicit goal answer question obliged offer response consider politicians press conferences planning task satisfy obligation responding question revealing answer possible 
cases agent know answer obligation respond may discharged explicit statement inability give answer 
obligations discourse obligations obligations represent agent set norms 
notion studied centuries formal aspects examined deontic logic 
needs fairly simple require extensive survey complexities arise literature 
intuitions underlying help clarify obligation generally obligation defined terms modal operator called permissible 
action obligatory permissible 
action forbidden permissible 
informal semantics operator positing set rules behavior action obligatory occurrence logically follows forbidden non occurrence logically follows action occur obligatory forbidden 
just action obligatory respect set rules mean agent perform action 
adopt model suggested shoham tennenholtz agents behavior violate defined social laws 
obligation satisfied means rules broken 
assume agents generally plan actions violate rules possible obligated actions usually occur 
directly conflict agent personal goals agent may choose violate 
obligations quite different reduced intentions goals 
particular agent may obliged action contrary goals example consider child apologize hitting younger brother 
reduced simple expectations obligations may act source expectations 
expectations guide action interpretation plan recognition processes proposed carberry expectations provide sufficient motivation agent perform expected action cases wrong doing unexpected performing expected action 
interpretation utterance clear coherence prior expectations 
need allow possibility agent performed action violates expectations 
agent violates obligations agent held accountable 
specific obligations arise variety sources 
conversational setting accepted offer promise incur obligation 
command request party bring obligation perform requested action 
obligation say call discourse obligation 
model obligation simple 
set rules encode discourse conventions 
new conversation act determined mcroy uses expectations derived adjacency pair structure schegloff sacks discourse obligations 
social norms impose notion accountability 
analysis oriented discovering misconceptions violated expectations alternative possibility violated obligations considered utterance recognition process allowed utterance production process 
performed action inferred conventional rules obligation 
simple forward chaining technique introduce obligations 
obligation rules performance conversation acts summarized table 
agent performs promise perform action performs acceptance suggestion request agent perform action agent achieve action question 
agent requests action performed request brings obligation address request accept reject decision known requester permitted ignore request 
question establishes obligation answer question 
utterance understood believed deficient way brings obligation repair utterance 
source obligation obliged action accept promise achieve request address request accept reject answer inform ref utterance understood repair utterance incorrect table sample obligation rules obligations behavior obligations beliefs agent obligations form important part reasoning process deliberative agent architecture proposed bratman 
addition considering beliefs world govern possibility performing actions success desires goals govern utility desirability actions social agent consider obligations govern actions 
large number strategies may incorporate obligations deliberative process weight compared agents goals 
conte castelfranchi strategies moving obligations actions including automatically performing obligated action adopting obligations goals adopting obligated action goal performing action results state desired agent 
cases goals conflict goals agent guaranteed performed 
general want allow action obligations supersede performance intended actions 
instance consider agent intention soon possible 
imposed possible perform intended action behaved agent need delay performance obligation dealt 
example intention perform series inform acts listener requests repair behaved agent repair inform proceeding initiate intended

discussion argued obligations play important role accounting interactions dialog 
obligations replace plan model augment 
resulting model readily accounts discourse behavior adversarial situations situations implausible agents adopt goals 
obligations encode learned social norms guide agent behavior need intention recognition shared plans discourse level 
complex intention recognition may required complex interactions needed handle typical interactions everyday discourse 
furthermore requirement mutually agreed rules create obligations 
clearly agents agree rules smoother interaction rules clearly virtually universal 
agent set individual rules need appeal shared knowledge account local discourse behavior 
argued architecture uses obligations provides simpler implementation strong plan approaches 
particular local discourse behavior arise reactive manner need complex planning 
side coin new set problems arise planning actions satisfy multiple constraints arise agent personal goals perceived obligations 
model allows naturally conversation varying levels 
initiative seen obligation driven process leading conversation goal driven 
representing obligations goals explicitly allows system naturally shift mode 
strongly operative domain trains system subordinate working goals locally working concerns user necessarily having shared discourse plan 
operative situations architecture allow system adhere conversational conventions respond different ways rejecting proposals refusing answer questions
