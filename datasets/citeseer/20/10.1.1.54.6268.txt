alternatively ask emotions occur requires evolutionary social explanation reasons emotional states behaviours evolved

effects interrupting stimulus include arousal autonomic nervous system production feelings emotion 
simon primarily concerned process goal interruption consequent change behaviour physiological subjective phenomena 
interruption required serve real time needs organism 
simon distinguishes types needs arising uncertain unpredicted environmental events predator example various physiological needs internal stimuli hunger cognitive associations example memory associations may cause anxiety 
simon distinguishes adaptive non adaptive interruption 
emotional stimulus normally considered interrupting disrupting serving help organism pursue multiple goals hindering 
certain cases emotion producing stimulus may persistent intense causing invoked goal repeatedly interrupted resulting behaviour 
learning change efficacy certain stimuli cause interruption allow new associations cause previously non interrupting stimuli interrupt 
example learning ignore car alarms learning avoid black ice 
addition organism may acquire new modified response patterns interrupting stimuli 
example experienced car driver repertoire plans dealing problem situations 
learning tend reduce response situations familiar

labour theory value holds exchange value simply value commodity represents amount social labour necessary 
number points need immediately 
value commodity price 
price particular commodity particular moment time determined factors instance local supply demand 
factors cause prices regularly deviate values 
simple commodity economy value commodities prices tend 
imply value commodity static 
supply demand costs production explain prices simple commodity economy theoretical allows economists reason value price needing take account complications price fixing taxation trade forth 
commodities example supply demand steering wheels cars may identical prices differ explaining difference prices terms difference costs production consideration determines price component commodities including cost labour 
second value represent actual labour social labour 
example unproductive day due interruptions take twelve hours produce average pair shoes 
actual labour expended production shoes high shoes sell correspondingly high value 
absurdity encouraging producers idle 
social labour counts 
social labour necessary commodity share total labour society required pair shoes current production techniques average degree skill intensity prevalent time 
commodity old slow methods lazy idle workers high value 
third explains total labour society allocated reallocated different branches production
