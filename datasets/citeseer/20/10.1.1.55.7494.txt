theory legibility urban environments brief review lynch concept legibility 
lynch defines legibility city ease parts may recognised organised coherent pattern lynch referring formation cognitive map person mind structure internal representation environment navigating destination 
image city describes experiments carried number major cities suggest cognitive maps built time 
experiments involved obtaining information long term inhabitants cities form example interviews written descriptions city drawn maps 
examining data lynch proposed elements urban landscapes identified primary building blocks cognitive maps districts sections environment distinct character provides coherence allowing viewed single entity 
districts may identifiable nature architecture buildings 
landmarks static recognisable objects give sense location bearing 
examples landmarks prominent buildings monuments smaller scale recognisable installations 
paths major avenues travel environment major roads 
nodes important points interest paths road junctions town squares 
edges structures features providing borders districts linear obstacles 
examples cities built large rivers major road

lynch specified number design techniques aimed creating enhancing features urban environment order improve legibility 
implementation legibility algorithms information visualisations consider general notion legibility specific legibility features identified lynch adapted virtual environments 
particular specify general purpose algorithms automatically creating enhancing legibility features range pre existing information visualisations 
describe algorithms implemented prototype system called leads legibility data spaces 
leads constructed example legibility layer independent sub system configuration basic integration able post process output visualisation systems order enhance legibility 
districts discovery districts data matter finding groups items strong similarities share items space 
order identify districts arbitrary data space techniques field cluster analysis number algorithms developed 
districts identified need represented visualisation 
example attributes colour shape give district distinct character provided attributes assigned specific meanings visualisation 
districts provide basis creating remaining legibility features 
choosing algorithm initial leads implementation set criteria simple due time constraints project relatively computationally inexpensive reasonably effective wide range clusters 
initially adopted zahn minimal spanning tree algorithm mst zahn 
basic algorithm described zahn able detect clusters varying shapes sizes long relatively distinct specific cases perform accurately described original 
edges edges usually imposing features section area 
sensible define edges existing adjoining districts 
considered possible methods defining edges 
quick method clusters generally spherical cuboid shape 
simple approach find nearest neighbour data items clusters similarity measure employed initial clustering process 
edge placed clusters line connecting items appropriate orientation 
provided objects excessively cut clusters positioned far logical joining point methods effective providing point defining borders clusters 
second method involves finding hull district creating edge just 
finding hull cluster objects space may computationally expensive 
third method refinement involves finding hulls adjoining districts 
complete edge defined interpolation points adjoining edges districts 
initial implementation leads system utilises method described positioning edges cluster nearest neighbours 
landmarks landmarks need stable points data space order serve common navigation 
considered possible methods defining landmark positions 
method places landmarks centroids district clusters 
partitional clustering algorithms define centroid group formed 
centroid virtual data element best describes cluster 
method define single landmark clusters act beacon navigation heart district 
second method places landmarks cluster intersections districts intersect 
method results fewer landmarks simply centroids landmarks created appear areas space number clusters meet 
anticipate kind location stable point help navigation better choice placement landmarks 
third method places landmarks centre triangles formed centroids group adjacent clusters 
produce approximately number landmarks cluster intersection method 
position landmarks seemingly quite similar produced second significantly different landmark placed central position points typify districts relying solely geometric point intersection 
suspect give balance placement landmarks simply positioning intersection points landmark positions responsive shapes clusters positions

assuming prior usage information necessary educated guesses data elements possibly nodes usage 
implemented approach leads nearest neighbour elements districts initial choices similar items district boundaries

network type spaces may data available identify nodes automatically connectivity information valency measures amounts data stored imply importance
