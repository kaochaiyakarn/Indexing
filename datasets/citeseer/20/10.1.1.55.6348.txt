study differs previous ones various methods automatic pronunciation assessment developed far bernstein neumeyer different machine measures automatic scoring hmm loglikelihood scores timing scores phone classification error scores segment duration scores 
phone log posterior probability scores investigated franco 

studies validity machine scores established comparing pronunciation scores assigned human experts human scores 
general raters asked assign global pronunciation score sentences uttered speaker sentence level rating 
scores sentences speaker averaged obtain speaker score speaker level rating see neumeyer franco 
procedure may logical sight problems 
scores assigned rater different sentences uttered speaker may differ function segmental 
example sound sentence score sentence may considerably lower sentences contain specific sound 
may case rater assign pronunciation score speaker sentence heavily influenced presence sound assign low speaker score 
case average score computed sentences speaker take account effect sound 
suggest researcher interested pronunciation scores speaker level human raters listen fragments containing phonetic inventory 
reason speaker scores obtained averaging relative sentence scores may reflect raters speaker judgements 
view experiment human raters asked assign scores individual sentences 
raters judged pronunciation speaker basis sets phonetically rich sentences 
studies mentioned correlations automatic scores human scores appear higher speaker level sentence level 
speaker level considerable differences observed various measures hmm log likelihood scores timing scores phone classification error scores segment duration scores 
measures neumeyer 
segment duration scores show highest degree correlation human assigned pronunciation scores 
franco 
phone log posterior probability scores better predictors human pronunciation scores correlation phone log posterior probability human scores turns 
sentence level correlations hand low 
attempts improve correlations sentence level combining different machine scores led additional relative increase correlation franco 
quite clearly trend kind research look machine measures best correlate human scores 
striking attempt little done try understand nature correlation machine scores human scores certainly useful improving automatic pronunciation assessment 
example mismatch knowledge available machine scores concerning human scores 
machine scores relatively clear say known calculated little known human scores 
research pronunciation evaluation revealed scores pronunciation quality may affected great variety speech characteristics 
nonnative speech deviate native speech various aspects fluency syllable structure word stress intonation segmental quality 
native speakers asked score nonnative speech pronunciation quality scores usually affected aspects 
literature considerable attention paid relative importance various aspects pronunciation quality intelligibility james johansson van de vries anderson hsieh koehler anderson hsieh johnson koehler 
research aimed investigating relationship native speaker ratings nonnative pronunciation deviance various aspects speech quality revealed area affects score different extent anderson hsieh johnson koehler 
findings suggest global ratings pronunciation quality assigned human raters complex structure 
may problematic scores benchmark automatically produced measures speech quality simply know human scores stand 
impression questions raters exactly evaluate influences judgements taken consideration trying develop machine measures best approach human pronunciation scores 
reason study specific pronunciation ratings collected global ratings pronunciation quality deciding aspects pronunciation quality investigated experiment took account fact scores produced speech recognizer hmm log likelihood scores phone log posterior probability scores timing scores phone classification error scores see neumeyer franco cover mentioned areas 
order obtain clear cut idea automatic scores agree human ratings asked human raters judge aspects pronunciation quality expect evaluated man machine segmental quality fluency speech rate 
furthermore experiment characterized fact limited assessing nonnative speech concerns native speech kinds standard speech speech different regional accents

specific ratings pronunciation quality possible gain insight relations human automatic scores explained 
specific pronunciation scores clear pronunciation influenced segmental quality human measure predicted poorly basis machine scores 
log likelihood ll intended automatic measure closely related segmental quality highly correlated utterance duration 
fact ll scores normalised duration longer showed correlation human scores 
fact high correlation ll pronunciation misleading 
nature ll measure think mainly ll measure segmental quality 
closer inspection revealed case 
high correlation ll pronunciation due close relation ll utterance duration 
strong dependence ll utterance duration probably due way ll calculated system moment ll utterance calculated summing lls individual words pauses 
strong dependence reflected clearly extremely high correlation ll total duration utterances words plus pauses 
subsequently important goal research find measure related segmental quality ll 
measure possible predict pronunciation higher degree accuracy obtained experiment 
done combining measure segmental quality temporal measure ros 
aspect study differs previous ones telephone speech 
people simply asked dial certain number free select time place location 
consequently resulting acoustic registrations differ ways studio usually quiet office environment 
mention relevant ones 
telephone speech bandwith hz 
second just high quality microphone different telephone microphones 
probably important relatively high level acoustic background signals frequently usually case laboratory speech 
consider conditions normal realistic sense technology applications telephone conditions probably similar 
underlined conditions automatic speech recognition difficult 
conclude results experiment promising show pronunciation scores assigned human experts accurately predicted basis measures computed speech recognizer 
furthermore results indicate machine scores improved obtain greater predictive power 
fact results obtained telephone speech normal realistic conditions promising
