rada suggest assessment similarity semantic networks fact thought involving just taxonomic links exclusion link types view taken admittedly excludes potentially useful information 
natural way evaluate semantic similarity taxonomy evaluate distance nodes corresponding items compared shorter path node similar 
multiple paths takes length shortest lee rada bicknell rada widely acknowledged problem approach relies notion links taxonomy represent uniform distances

measure problems 
problem simple edge counting measure produces spuriously high similarity measures words basis inappropriate word senses 
example table shows word similarity words tobacco 
tobacco alcohol similar drugs tobacco sugar similar entirely dissimilar classified substances 
problem arises similarity rating tobacco horse word sim class tobacco alcohol drug tobacco sugar substance tobacco horse table similarity tobacco computed maximizing information content horse slang term result information similarity maximized path length minimized words categorized 
contrary intuition 
cases probably relatively rare 
example illustrates general concern measuring similarity words really relationship word senses matters similarity measure able take account 
absence reliable algorithm choosing appropriate word senses straightforward way information setting consider concepts nouns belong just single maximally informative class 
suggests redefining similarity follows sim ff gamma log fc set concepts dominating ff 
measure similarity takes information account previous relying single concept maximum information content allows class contribute information content value ff 
intuitively ff values measure relevance example ff low general usage high context newspaper article drug dealers 
resolving syntactic ambiguity semantic information resnik local syntactic information successfully set values ff 
related counting edges taxonomies people tried published descriptions attempts directly evaluate effectiveness method 
number researchers attempted conceptual distance information retrieval

sussna uses semantic relatedness measured wordnet word sense disambiguation defining measure distance weights different types links explicitly takes depth taxonomy account 
relevant related appears unpublished manuscript leacock chodorow defined measure resembling information content normalized path length concepts compared probability subsuming concept 
specifically define sim gamma log min len theta max notation equation

leacock chodorow experimented measure information content measure described context word sense disambiguation yield roughly similar results 
significantly implemented method tested task reported previous section outperforms measure 
led followup experiment different larger set noun pairs followup study information measure performed better 
relationship algorithms require study 
significant approaches take form log information measure originally proposed resnik context current research computational linguistics approach semantic similarity taken viewed hybrid combining statistical methods knowledge taxonomic information 
corpus statistics evaluating word similarity prior taxonomic knowledge currently active area research natural language community 
largely reaction sparse data problems training statistical language models difficult come accurate statistical characterization behavior words encountered times 
word similarity appears promising way solve problem behavior word approximated smoothing observed behavior behavior words similar 
example speech recognizer seen phrase ate conclude john ate reasonable sequence words english seen sentences mary ate pear knows pear similar behavior 
literature corpus determination word similarity growing leaps bounds extensive discuss detail review see resnik approaches problem share common assumption semantically similar words similar distributional behavior corpus 
assumption common treat words occur near word constituting features compute word similarity terms similar feature sets 
information retrieval feature representation word followup study netnews archives gather highly frequent nouns related topic areas selected noun pairings random order avoid biasing followup study favor algorithm 
takes form vector similarity computation amounting computation distance highly multidimensional space 
distance measure uncommon derive word classes hierarchical clustering 
difficulty distributional methods measure similarity distance interpreted 
word classes resulting distributional clustering described semantic capture syntactic pragmatic stylistic factors 
new measure semantic similarity taxonomy notion information content
