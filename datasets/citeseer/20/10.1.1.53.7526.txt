overhead projection problems 
potential problem shadows possible example lean look projected image closely

issue projection brightness room 
projectors experiments quite normal fluorescent lights bright desk lamp direct sunlight display unreadable may limit desk usability settings 
problem projection surfaces screens

reading documents digitaldesk read selected portions documents steps necessary image capture thresholding case text character recognition 
image capture document images captured overhead video camera difficulty standard video cameras low resolution compared scanners 
way solve problem marcel document recognition system pre scan documents high resolution low resolution camera image look corresponding scanned image 
pre scan published communications acm july europarc tech report epc page ning inconvenient interactive applications prototypes described cameras zoomed close desk obtain high resolution image spots inch

long run high definition television advances low cost integrated digital cameras approach economical 
thresholding image produced video camera frame grabber gray scale typically bits pixel represents white sheet black ink 
gray scale image thresholded converted bit pixel black white image character recognition example applications described 
simple global thresholding adequate obtaining image suitable character recognition 
normal office lighting range brightness different parts desk varies greatly global threshold creates large patches black white indistinguishable text see 
order bit pixel image black white document system adaptive thresholding algorithm varies threshold value image accord simple global thresholding published communications acm july europarc tech report epc page ing background value pixel 
adaptive thresholding algorithms produce results require pass image slow support user interaction 
possible get nearly result single pass calculating threshold value point estimate background illumination moving average local pixel intensities 
method fast combined scaling operation necessary 
dealing text thresholded image skew corrected recognized ocr server case xerox imaging system 
resolution high relative text size returns associated ascii string 
process guaranteed accurate important provide quick feedback calculator example simple way user correct unrecognized characters 
self calibration support interaction desk projected feedback selective grabbing images camera digitaldesk requires step calibration process 
absolute positions digitizing tablet mapped positions display order provide feedback 
second positions display mapped corresponding positions frame grabber order support grabbing selected areas desk 
finger tracking pointing second step necessary 
unfortunately factors conspire calibration difficult 
projected display perfect rectangle optical distortions camera tablet may rotated relative projected display may necessary camera view projected display angle 
vibrations caused air doors cause movements disrupt calibration adjustments equipment 
obtaining data calibrate pointing device display relatively straight forward series points displayed user prompted touch pointer 
obtaining data calibrating camera display simple 
obvious way adjust size shape projected rectangle desk looking image video monitor 
rectangle aligned edges monitor producing rough calibration data assumes rotation scanning video monitor 
general assumptions correct performing tedious manual procedure result poor 
better approach project image located image processing system allowing system self calibrate assistance user 
current system projects thick plus sign uses image morphology routines dan pinpoint center mark frame grabber coordinate space 
published communications acm july europarc tech report epc page calibration points calculate accurate mapping system currently uses point calibration system compensate rotation 
calculate mapping points uses equations see

user experiences formal experiments conducted digitaldesk number people performed tasks reactions noted 
subjects traditional workstations pcs said desk generally comfortable natural 
unexpected result tests bothered projection system shadows cast hands objects 
fact desk fifteen minutes user asked glass looked see display coming 
may people shadows cast overhead lights desk lamps types shadows hardly noticed 
session subjects asked felt desk compared traditional workstation 
reaction quite similar commented specifically space healthy screen easier eyes manual 
handedness traditional workstation user interfaces digitaldesk take account handedness 
feedback projected lower left pointer example right handed person trouble seeing left handed person trouble projected hand 
course handedness affects pen system projected point warping published communications acm july europarc tech report epc page display shadows strengthen effect 
feedback affected general layout applications 
french english translation application example inadvertently assumed users right handed documents left projected definitions right 
left handed subjects setup required reach arm farther right handed subjects time arms hid reading 
handedness issues addressed overhead camera automatically detect hand user pointing information applications

obscuring selections subjects noticed difference selecting pixels workstation selecting marks digitaldesk 
workstation obscure pointer select system knows underneath 
pointing digitaldesk system able see means fingers pointing devices way 
may possible address issue storing previously scanned images marcel system example face problem

general system see selection user see easy learn 
selection feedback play important role preventing users obscuring selections 
fixed selection rectangle centered pointer extreme example impossible get pointer way
