location information speech recognition television news broadcasts alexander hauptmann andreas carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa usa informedia digital video library system extracts information digitized video sources allows full content search retrieval extracted data 
extracted metadata enables users rapidly find interesting news stories quickly identify retrieved tv news story relevant query 
extraction named entity information broadcast news determine people organizations dates times monetary amounts mentioned broadcast 
respect location data able location analysis derived speech transcripts allow user visually follow action news story map allow queries news stories graphically selecting region map 

informedia digital video library project informedia digital video library project initiated uniquely utilizes integrated speech image natural language understanding process broadcast video 
project goal allow search retrieval video medium similar available today text 
enable access video fast high accuracy automatic transcriptions broadcast news stories generated carnegie mellon sphinx speech recognition system closed captions incorporated available 
image processing determines scene boundaries recognizes faces allows image similarity comparisons

speech recognition speech recognition informedia digital video library done different passes 
get initial transcript library quickly possible word vocabulary version sphinx ii recognizer applied 
second pass slower accurate sphinx iii speech recognition system 
darpa broadcast news evaluations cmu sphinx iii system achieved word error rate multiple passes applied 
result obtained processing speeds times real time 
speech recognition reasonably fast restrict beam recognizer resulting word error rate broadcast news evaluation data 
obtain better performance additional training data extracted closed captioned news transcripts speech recognizer high confidence data correct 
addition build new language model day interpolates standard broadcast news transcription corpus current online web news reports actual transcripts available cnn website cnn com 
help improved acoustic models daily language model obtain word error 
parallelize processing news story actual transcript data appears library hours broadcast time 

location analysis named entity extraction process provide location data derived speech transcripts map displays searches 
named entity tagger implemented described extract possible location phrases audio transcript 
take output video optical character recognition extraction extract possible location phrases video ocr 
possible locations cross referenced gazetteer places locations include countries cities villages states provinces world 
currently excluded list water areas mountains non political geographical data 
ignore locations gazetteer latitude longitude accuracy named entity extraction process se critical 
relevant question identified correct coordinates location 
location gazetteer chance providing coordinates location entity 
words phrase describing location speech recognition vocabulary chance providing proper coordinates properly identified words denoting location 
locations ambiguous coordinates 
need disambiguate different locations washington may refer number cities united states refer state 
simple hierarchical disambiguation scheme implemented distinguish candidate coordinates 
location determined ambiguous check location current news story disambiguate alternate locations 

location ambiguous see location state province favor particular state 
way example distinguish different initially ambiguous memphis different states united states 

disambiguating evidence state province level check see location distinguished basis country news story transcripts 
mention france conjunction paris example distinguish paris texas paris france assumption texas france mentioned news story 

location ambiguous check locations continents disambiguate locations 

information ambiguous discard choose alternative location interpretations 
obvious sophisticated approach large amount manually coded training data help distinguish ambiguous locations 
sufficient amounts training data hmm approach lines feasible 
position afford manual large amounts data simple approach appears distinguish different ambiguous locations 
notable exception disambiguation new york city state 
approach frequently fails distinguish example governor new york drove new york meet mayor 
cues mention new york city vs new york state distinguish alternative ambiguous location 
big factor information quality gazetteer 
automatic process adding new locations coordinates gazetteer errors misspellings erroneous data corrected hand 
location information stored relational database associates locations specific news stories time periods news story 
database queried textually looking location names text strings geographically coordinates locations lookup id news story 
case set location names coordinates news stories identification tags returned 
having coordinates identified allows location database information ways 
locations occur news story added title information 
automatically created titles speech transcripts quite noisy helps identify major locations news story 

locations dynamically displayed map allowing user follow geographic focus news story 
video audio relevant paragraph selection playing locations focus highlighted 
dynamic map serves static summary locations news story identifying locations news story glance 

query graphically specifies rectangle map find news stories refer locations map area 
user drag rectangle shows automatically generated map news detailing president clinton trip africa march 
news story transcript talks various stops south africa 
screen snapshot taken narrator detailed events clinton 
system highlighted country cities currently focus showing boldly countries places mentioned news story 
user select area map mouse initiate spatial query retrieve news stories related specified locations location information allows active maps maps change mention current location audio interactive maps user request selecting area map 

extracting information audio track news stories data useful informedia system 
informedia digital video library news ondemand system goes simple extraction named entities audio stream presents demonstration ultimate extracted information matters improved percentage point extraction accuracy information extraction approach 
emphasize integration presentation extracted metadata informedia video library usable useful 
critical multiple different types extracted information allow user quickly scan information different forms metadata redundancy overcome errors type metadata 
plan extend named entities location analysis include link analysis people places organizations 
working analysis time expressions news stories understand temporal relationship named entities multiple news stories
