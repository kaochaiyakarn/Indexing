shadow paging optimizations appears faster log solutions generally applicable 
new potentially useful ideas efficiently implemented shadow paging logging 
idea shadow paging overwrite valid data 
page table map logical page numbers physical page numbers modified pages written unused parts database 
page table updated atomically transaction commit reflect new state database 
allows arbitrary atomic transactions 
original idea shadow paging 
implemented system database manager supported concurrent operation complicated multi user shadow paging system logs directory pages 
approaches concurrent operation listed 
general shadow paging considered inappropriate large multi user systems pp 

simpler multi user version shadow paging 
comparison methods differential files performance inferior 
primary overhead turned updating indirection page table root pointer 
overhead due root pointer updates page table reduced committing transactions simultaneously batch 
experimental results indicated shadow paging better logging environments general logging performed better 
overhead shadow paging caused page table reads 
currently major database systems logging little shadow paging years 
memory sizes correspondingly cache sizes increased significantly quite reasonable keep entire page table large database main memory 
example assuming kb pages byte page table entries page table kb mb database mb gb database 
cost main memory needed hold page table order percent cost disk space database 
conventional shadow paging performs fairly page table main memory 
ideas speed writes factor compensating page table updates making shadow paging potentially faster update place solutions 
enhancements new ideas significantly improve usefulness shadow paging 
concurrent shadow paging presentation shadow paging differs somewhat basic ideas identical 
physical structure database illustrated 
database page table pointer contains address page table disk 
page table pointer points valid page table times updated atomically 
page hold rapidly changing information call page page table pointer 
page table forms mapping logical page numbers physical page numbers 
physical page allocated logical page number 
page table disk called shadow page table 
current page table represented explicitly transaction incremental page table :10.1.1.161.1376
incremental page table conceptually list changes page table 
entry incremental page table form hl old pnew logical page number old old physical page number corresponding logical page pnew new physical page number 
page table pointer data pages page table pages shadow paging file structure 
shadow paging multi user environment reads lock accessed logical page shared mode writes lock logical page exclusive mode 
shared locks released application requests commit transaction exclusive locks transaction committed 
effectively phase locking 
incremental page table contains entries modified pages modified pages exclusively locked guarantee page incremental page table 
application requests commit transaction transaction marked partially committed 
database system periodically times second processing previous commit batch completed take partially committed transactions commit batch 
page incremental page table know conflicts transactions 
changes installed global page table allocating new pages modified page table pages page table shadowed 
pages modified transaction modified page table pages flushed disk 
reached disk page table pointer written adjacent physical pages implement atomic update 
reached disk transactions batch committed new batch 
effect commit batching studied shadow paging logging 
need garbage collection 
transaction aborted new physical pages incremental page table put back free list action needed 
transaction committed old physical pages incremental page table put free list old versions modified page table pages 
allocating adjacent physical pages commit allocation physical page numbers delayed transaction commits modified page flushed cache 
possible allocate pages needed commit batch contiguous region dimensional array multiple disks 
means need seek writes changes page table updates transactions written disk sequentially 
speedup writes order factor 
optimization contradicts usual attempt keep logical physical mapping linear approximately linear 
update place systems write eventually results seek write original location hot spots multiple writes data may combined dynamically mapped systems shadow paging possible allocate contiguous region avoid seeks rotational latencies 
terms resources cost typical transaction reduced half reads unaffected writes cheap doubling rate transactions second supported equipment 
caching effective writes cheap caching affects reads writes eventually go disk hot spots 
writes expensive reads half operations writes double performance improving caching 
writes cost tenth cost reads performance improved factor 
log file systems similar optimization 
clustering important problem databases clustering related data 
clustering page easily achieved idea shadow paging write page new location clustering pages difficult 
approaches attempt keep logical physical mapping approximately linear compatible write optimizations 
problem worst large multi megabyte objects 
worst case page large object require separate seek 
clustering large objects achieved combining adjacent physical pages 
logical level concept adjacent normal sized physical pages 
page table entries contain size number contiguous physical pages logical page addition address physical page 
fairly large large objects constructed relatively 
forming large object stored different disk drives allowing parallel reading multiple drives analogously dimensional file system 
requires sufficient amount free space available database contiguous free areas 
general disk ms seek time including latency mb sec transfer rate speedup factor kb pages factor kb pages factor kb pages 
way fight fragmentation free space thread combine free pages larger areas moving pages adjacent larger free area fill smaller free areas 
moving task simple modifications local affecting single logical page time 
logical page number physical page simple reverse mapping table main memory table fairly large order size page table 
clustering important scanning large tables 
large objects table usually consists large number small independently updatable data items 
updating part requires entire written new location appropriate structures small data items updated frequently 
tradeoff size efficiency small updates efficiency sequential scans 
perfectly feasible select size table object type basis 
writes cheap concurrent shadow paging environment possible maintain indexes update place systems cost reducing need sequential scans 
automatic load balancing disk concurrent shadow paging system caused reads 
writes fairly long sequential bursts followed page table pointer write 
reads easily balanced disks freely choose write page write disk idle 
page time removed previous location busy disk load busy disk reduced load idle disk increased 
suitable parameterization avoid oscillations automatic load balancing disks achieved 
page table pointer reside fixed location 
possible page table pointers disk pointer contains timestamp indicating sequence number commit pointer 
startup time system selects pointer highest sequence number 
commit time pointer idle disk selected 
early releasing locks normally shared locks released transaction partially committed exclusive locks transaction fully committed 
commit batch active time new batch begins partially committed transactions included batch 
means transaction partially commits transaction reach partially committed state get fully committed earlier 
release exclusive locks soon transaction partially committed trust transaction accessed uncommitted data commit modifications earlier transaction committing 
significantly reduces time exclusive locks held allowing concurrency 
full persistence required application successful commit reported application immediately successful commit reported commit batch completed 
side effect optimization transactions may see uncommitted data 
guaranteed data get explicitly aborted gets implicitly aborted system crash transactions data get aborted implicit cascading rollback 
transactions display uncommitted data user die occur connection system failure acceptable applications 
similar optimization implementations 
fine granularity locking fine granularity locking database systems commercial systems page table level locking 
aware previous fine granularity locking shadow paging 
major problem fine granularity locking allow multiple transactions modify different parts page possible individually commit abort modifications 
transactions share copy page install page table commits 
transaction keep changes separately commit time store page 
changes kept example list attached transaction indexed page number byte range object identifier 
approach fine granularity locking works small transactions large transactions may modify objects incrementing value field record table 
storing changes main memory may feasible commit slow changes need installed respective pages commit time 
solution fine granularity locking new transactions transaction modified certain number objects page level locking transaction 
large transaction hold table level lock resorting page level locking reduce concurrency case 
current snapshot snapshot snapshot snapshot state time snapshots represent consistent database states time past 
snapshots possible take snapshot entire database saving address page table preventing freeing pages snapshot 
database accessed saved page table address fully consistent snapshot database seen view change long guarantee pages referenced snapshot freed 
dropping snapshot efficient microseconds millisecond independent database size 
take arbitrary number snapshots different times consistent long pages freed 
shadow paging system modifies accessible pages postponing freeing updated pages sufficient maintain consistency snapshots 
describe efficient algorithm deducing page freed presence snapshots 
snapshots implement consistent dumping database implementing optimistic multiversion concurrency control 
readonly transactions implemented snapshot reading snapshot 
idea snapshots illustrated 
multi level incremental dumping algorithms fly dumping log databases 
algorithms fuzzy dump database dumping log records changes dump 
describes algorithm directly take consistent dump locking correspondingly possibly causing transactions aborted 
earlier algorithms support incremental dumping having bit modified pages set page modified scheme generalized multi level dumping existing approaches incremental dumping require scanning entire database pages changed 
costly disk databases 
presents algorithm necessary algorithm space consuming general 
shadow paging possible obtain transaction consistent dump entire database disturbing normal transaction processing snapshot database reading database snapshot 
locking needed dump 
incremental dumping implemented storing page table entry serial number commit batch modified page 
serial number maintained cpu overhead increases size page table 
serial numbers timestamps possible dump pages changed certain point time 
normally time timestamp full dump previous incremental dump timestamp dump serial number commit done snapshot dump taken 
incremental dumping shadow paging highly efficient cached page table needs scanned pages dumped need read 
logical database dumped unused physical pages 
multiple database versions snapshot seen copy write copy database 
long freeing pages copies prevented run arbitrary transactions snapshot take new snapshot modified version 
discussion call snapshot version database 
note database versions differ conventional object versions global 
object versions database versions desired 
versions database form tree 
user point view versions fully independent 
transactions need synchronized transactions version version dropped time new versions may forked existing version 
need consider version primary version database fully feasible drop previous primary version start version database primary 
multiple versions permanent database 
possible implementation atomically updatable master pointer page table pointer 
master pointer point page table pointer pages remember page table pointer may contain data addition actual address page table 
page table pointers reside normal shadowed database storage 
multiple permanent versions useful applications 
examples include large design databases design directions considered simultaneously poor ones dropped new forks created needed 
application asking questions large database snapshot snapshot snapshot version version version versions database form tree 
implicit snapshots retained nodes multiple children 
affecting original database 
large knowledge bases multiple versions implement interesting searching algorithms 
possibilities interesting applications numerous unexplored 
possible support multiple independently updatable database versions efficiently existing databases 
concurrent shadow paging creating dropping database versions light operations microseconds milliseconds range 
algorithm determining physical page freed fact physical page referenced version database occur logical location versions 
versions children modified new version automatically created necessary immediate parent direct children need checked freeing pages 
dropping version principle equivalent freeing pages 
long version ancestors modified pages modified pages need checked 
unmodified snapshots contain pages dropping causes pages freed ancestors dropped 
phase commit distributed databases common method implementing transactions distributed databases phase commit 
implementing phase commit requires changes transaction saved survive possible crash undone 
algorithm resembles substantial differences 
basic idea store incremental page table disk phase commit leave pointer incremental page table page table pointer 
crash occurs incremental page table recovered copy disk coordinator queried fate transaction 
second phase commit transaction committed normally incremental page table disk freed atomically commit batch 
processing global transactions done concurrently processing local transactions 
phase node requested phase commit shared locks released immediately 
incremental page table transaction modified pages written disk 
saved information sufficient reconstruct incremental page table locks crash identify coordinator transaction transaction coordinator 
processing commit batch pointer incremental page table disk added page table pointer 
page table pointer stored disk system reports ready coordinator 
algorithm extended handle locking storing modified versions objects 
second phase second phase executed transaction commit 
pointer incremental page table disk removed page table pointer commit disk space freed 
coordinator decided abort transaction pointer incremental page table disk removed page table pointer commit batch disk space freed 
abort done normally 
crash recovery crash recovery system read incremental page tables partially processed global transactions disk 
pages mentioned incremental page tables counted extracting free list page table 
exclusive locks logical pages modified transactions restored system query coordinator global transaction fate transaction 
normal transaction processing locks held recovered global transactions restored 
coordinator global transaction keep information answer queries fate transaction keeping list global transactions partially phase committed reported fully committed machines 
list active global transactions kept page table pointer extension disk 
media recovery logging concurrent shadow paging logging crash recovery 
media recovery important log systems log bring system date dump 
shadow paging suited high concurrency environments relatively small disks 
natural solution media recovery raid disk system 
shadow paging supports consistent multi level incremental dumping disturbing normal transaction processing 
allows dumping large database quite frequently example full dump week incremental day incremental daily dump hour incremental hourly dump minutes 
logs purposes recovery 
maintaining logs possible shadow paging system 
log example implemented large object transactions append log record change value data item 
log resides normal logical pages manipulated transactions object 
appending log records probably needs built support avoid concurrency bottlenecks append commit abort records 
tail log flushed disk part processing commit batch log consistent state database 
logging cause little overhead transaction processing adds little data sequential write
