normal implementation inverted file organisation term list linked document identifiers plus counting data pointers actual texts 
user request word list phrases sentences extended text 
terms matching index terms normally content words see section 
request processing words prepositions conjunctions eliminated word list usually removed economy reasons inverted file construction 
terms generally stems roots full words means matches missed trivial word variation singular plural forms 
stemming achieved simply user truncating request words match inverted index words include better strategy truncate standard stemming algorithm suffix list see porter nicer user reduces inverted term list

iterative searching natural development searching collection frequency weights defined 
initial search obtain documents assessed relevance user request marked relevant non relevant

hand searching restarted retrieved relevant document new request generate variable query term frequencies 
elaborations may sensible files index explicitly complex compound terms specialised proper names fixed multi word strings units just hope matching search time 
suitable lexicon available assist construction inverted file supply necessary counting data weighting 
discovering inspection multi word strings file quite different expensive enterprise 
may possible require matching pair words preliminary ranking output may practicable go document presence require text proximity
