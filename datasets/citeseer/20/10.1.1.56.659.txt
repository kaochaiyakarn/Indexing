length alignment program idea appeared brown gale church suggest method aligning pairs texts 
relies hypotheses lengths number characters segments translations highly correlated translations done translation patterns sentence translates consecutive sentences translate sentence translates sentences translate sentence translated new sentence equivalent source text introduced translator 
assuming paragraphs aligned nth paragraph text translation nth paragraph second text program works follows 
pair aligned paragraphs consider possible couples constructed translation patterns 
assign couple score intended reflect segments relate 
scores dynamic programming scheme determine best sequence couples leading valid alignment 
gale church scoring function probabilistic model 
produces approximation probability segments mutual translations lengths segments likelihood translation pattern connects 
success rate method surprisingly high program finds couples correct alignment 
remaining couples alignment errors pairs unrelated partially related segments pairs segments segmented 
possible explanation high rate success time program solving easy problems 
obviously paragraphs containing sentences chances correct alignment trivial alignments expected alignment program tends produce 
soon problems get little harder program mistakes 
example paragraphs contain different number sentences assume translator translate source text contraction expansion translation pattern 
straightforward situations short sentences translate long sentence couples alignment highly length correlated quite program incorrectly introduces irregular alignment expansion contraction point actual troublesome spot
