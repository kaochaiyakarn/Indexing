packet video transmission overview traditional communication networks telephone system circuit switched links fixed capacities early digital video transmission focused coding video constant bitrate cbr links 
rate video signal exceed capacity underlying channel video transmission system able adapt rate signal introducing distortion controlled fashion 
idea rate information source video adjusted degrading reconstruction quality born rate distortion theory developed shannon 
rate distortion framework forms traditional video codec design codec parameters compression quality dynamically adjusted match transmission rate cbr communications channel 
illustrates model 
video signal fed adjustable rate codec rate controlled quantization parameters 
output codec feeds smoothing buffer drains constant rate match capacity underlying cbr channel 
turn smoothing buffer instantaneous level controls amount quantization applied coding process 
smoothing buffer fills codec video buffer bits compressed level codec traditional cbr coding model 
traditional cbr coding model output variable rate codec feeds smoothing buffer drains constant rate 
degree quantization controlled buffer occupancy buffer level maintained target level avoid buffer overflow underflow 
fast quantization increased reduce codec output 
likewise buffer drains fast amount quantization reduced prevent buffer underflow consequent stall decoder 
shannon rate distortion framework provides theoretical foundation type buffer control strategy 
model video signal random process shannon theory provides lower bound rate code signal subject level distortion 
lower bound related entropy rate process intuitively represents inherent compressibility signal 
analogous classical thermodynamic definition entropy high entropy implies information content signal highly disordered hard compress low entropy implies information content highly structured correlated consequently easy compress 
entropy measure directly represents average number bits symbol required code discrete information source shannon showed codes constructed rates arbitrarily close optimum 
entropy real video signals typically varies spatial extent image frame frame variation quite large 
cbr model quantization parameters vary time significantly map underlying dynamic entropy smooth output 
codec parameters dynamically adjusted match underlying cbr transmission capacity quality vary significantly time variation quality adverse impact perceived quality 
circuit switched networks video signals shaped cbr channel suffer variable quality cbr transmission model behaved predictable understood 
cbr transmission widely deployed years circuit switched telephone network 
circuit switched network circuit established call placed allocating resources physical path network 
example public phone network allocates kb circuit voice call 
circuit switched approach allows calls easily aggregated network time division multiplexing tdm 
tdm simultaneous calls multiplexed high capacity link serving equal sized messages input stream synchronous round robin fashion 
solution problem variable quality constant rate allocate bandwidth cbr channel handle peak rate transmission 
peak rate allocation allows constant quality fixed distortion transmission network underutilized cbr channel wholly exploited variable bit rate vbr signal runs peak rate 
efficiency peak rate allocation greatly reduced inherent burstiness video 
chin network codec decoder video network feedback network codec network integrated video codec 
model feedback congestion control packet video 
smoothing buffer eliminated replaced network 
congestion feedback network smoothing buffer occupancy controls codec output rate 
characterized burstiness compressed video signals garrett showed typical video sources exhibit long range dependence rate behavior bursty large time scales 
consequently little hope smoothing source cbr channel large variations quality gross underutilization channel 
packet switched networks maintain constant quality transmission face bursty behavior replace underlying cbr transmission model vbr model 
packet switched network sources need conform constant rate multiplexing carried asynchronous fashion 
messages multiple incoming links multiplexed single outgoing link serving messages come served order 
instantaneous traffic bursts absorbed queuing packet transmission line available 
result messages generally experience variable queuing delay multiplexor 
packet switched network bursty vbr video sources multiplexed single link giving better aggregate utilization peak rate allocation cbr flows 
roughly speaking multiplex number vbr flows sum average peak rates link capacity 
gain realized type multiplexing called statistical multiplexing gain 
unfortunately gain statistical sense relies fact constituent streams mix nicely 
bursts stream rarely line cause multiplexing queue exceed limit 
happen multiplexor said congested typically resorts discarding messages 
discarded messages turn cause degraded performance underlying video flows 
possible bursts line cause congestion total offered load video flows exceed fixed capacity bottleneck link network 
video exerts sustained open loop load network flows enter network network easily saturated experience sustained congestion 
video stream rate controlled adaptively adjusting codec parameters video sources network potentially adjusting output rates match aggregate capacity underlying network 
source individually obtain feedback network adjust transmission rate accordingly 
network congested source decreases rate network underutilized source increases rate

forward error correction fec coding cited technique coping isolated packet loss 
adding redundant bits transmission subset transmitted packets reconstruct original bit stream 
coding theory literature contains rich array techniques error correcting block codes 
yavatkar simple techniques packet transmission repetition codes packet duplication parity packets 
types error control codes simple implement high overhead compared sophisticated codes widely 
priority encoding transmission pet utilizes forward error correction coding considers called unequal error protection uep codes :10.1.1.22.8116
scheme source signal partitioned relative importance different subsets bit stream 
example pet authors prioritize mpeg separating intra coded predicted bi directionally predicted frames classes decreasing importance 
prioritized bits encoded novel property subset original packets comprise message decoded reconstruct original important blocks message overhead 
assume packets randomly distributed message blocks face packet loss pet delivers highest priority messages possible regardless packets dropped 
effect pet provides prioritized drop policies explicit network support cost transmission rate overhead
