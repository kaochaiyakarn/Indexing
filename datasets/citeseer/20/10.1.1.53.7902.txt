summary applying software agent paradigm collaborative discourse theory human computer interaction graphical user interfaces posed number challenges including applying discourse theory requiring natural language understanding agent embodying application independent aspects discourse algorithms data structures collaboration manager providing modular description application specific information 
believe current strong start goals provides new conceptual platform build higher 
plans include improving flexibility robustness discourse processing algorithms especially related incompleteness agent recipe library handling parallel interleaved goals supporting negotiation user agent pilot user study compare example application interface agent collagen build agents operate remotely space time internet require discussion agent user past actions
