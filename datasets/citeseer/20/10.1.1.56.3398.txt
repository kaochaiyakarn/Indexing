fair say researchers studying dialogue discourse developed theories detailed analysis empirical data diverse dialogue situations 
review field grosz pollack sidner mentions task oriented dialogues descriptions complex objects narratives informal formal arguments negotiations explanations 
thing studies shown human dialogue com plex activity leading corresponding complexity theories proposed 
particular evident participants rely knowledge reasoning capabilities different kinds know going dialogue 
comes data theories design natural language interfaces argued human dialogues regarded norm starting point natural dialogue person computer resemble dialogue humans possible 
different kinds dialogues differ complexity simple service encounters type applications natural language interfaces presumably exhibit complexities seen forms dialogues 
furthermore computer person differences expected major influence dialogue making data human interaction unreliable source information important aspects design particular style complexity interaction 
look differences dialogue situations play significant role 
know language influenced interpersonal factors 
take example suggested lakoff called indirect speech acts motivated need follow rules 
don impose 
give options 
user feel need polite computer 
users indirect requests search information database 
need component nli handling indirect requests 
obviously empirical question answered studying language situations 
indirect utterances course just ways polite 
forms omitting obvious steps argument relying listener background knowledge giving answers question supplying information relevant inferred higher goal 
presumably vary assessed characteristics dialogue partner 
case keyboard input important factor communication channel different form ordinary human dialogues 
fact dialogue written spoken obviously affect language 
pointed cohen keyboard interaction emphasis optimal packaging information smallest linguistic space appears mode alters normal organization discourse 
language behaviour levels pronunciation choice words sentences seen result attempts find optimal compromise needs need understood need reach goal little effort possible 
established fact linguistic research speakers adapt perceived characteristics interlocutors

concerned natural language interfaces argument relevance kinds intelligent dialogue systems 
methodological point simply acquire relevant knowledge need high quality empirical data 
point simple gathering data quite simple 
way doing simulating intelligent interfaces systems called wizard oz studies having person simulate interface system 
important realize acquire required high quality data great deal care consideration need design experiments
