great deal research systems small subset past included usability studies 
rodden performed series experiments goal determine organization visual similarity useful features global image properties colors textures spatial layout image regions 
results suggested images organized category labels understandable grouped visual features 
ethnographic studies image search needs indicated great need conceptually rich image search 
study art directors art buyers stock photo researchers search appropriate images iterative process specifying weighting criteria searchers view retrieved images add criteria add restrictions change criteria redefine search 
concept starts loosely defined refined process continues 
reported field study journalists newspaper editors choosing photos digital archive order illustrate newspaper articles 
journalists stressed need browsing considered searching photos specific objects trivial task 
selection search keys general topics considered difficult journalists emphasized need photos dealing places types objects themes 
journalists access advanced search interface allowed search different features format consisted entry forms dropdown boxes seen complex rarely 
desire searches multiple categories interface discouraged doing 
query study supports notion users want search images combinations topical categories 
enser analyzed set queries submitted image film libraries 
classified queries facet matrix example rio fell geographic location kind event 
summarize queries contain multiple facets showed set selected queries assigned average facets query 
system proposed interface similar approach 
interface operated modes showing metadata associated target image presenting images order reflecting number categories common target image ii allowing user select set category labels showing sample images similar categories showing images labeled new england africa egypt category label florida selected 
hierarchy information shown information provided images available category 
focus groups observing demonstration enthusiastic followup appears done 
metadata define illustrate notion faceted metadata 
faceted metadata content oriented category metadata prevalent years 
individual collections rich metadata assigned contents example biomedical journal articles typically dozen content attributes attached 
metadata organizing collections classified dimensions metadata may faceted composed orthogonal sets categories 
example domain fine arts images possible facets themes military religious artist names time periods media etching ceramic geographical locations 
metadata individual facet may flat pablo picasso hierarchical located vienna austria europe 
metadata individual facet may multi valued 
data may allow value assigned item measures cm tall may allow multiple values assigned item uses oil paint ink 
number challenges associated metadata including choosing appropriate descriptors collection assigning metadata descriptors items metadata assigned 
researchers investigating problems fact existing important collections contents hierarchical metadata assigned 
collection preparation collection study consisted approximately images images thinker collection fine arts museum san francisco metadata available subset images 
collection contained standard arts metadata facets including artist names types media dates little way content metadata 
lacked metadata categories describe appearance items images depicted case paintings

developed algorithm semi automatically convert descriptions set metadata categories assumed useful students scholars art history 
done comparing words descriptions higher level category labels wordnet retaining subset frequently occuring categories 
categories tended correspond highly ambiguous terms arm head body part terms discarded

labels incorrectly assigned algorithm worked surprisingly 
directly ask usability study participants trusted metadata categories independently volunteered comments 
majority participants expressed pleasure seeing content descriptors addition traditional descriptors 
participants commented confusing opening page shows text search box level metadata terms 
hovering facet name yields tooltip shown location explaining meaning facet 
classification issues appear disrupt flow participants searches negatively affect evaluation system
