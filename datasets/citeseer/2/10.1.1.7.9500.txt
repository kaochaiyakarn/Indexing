consider implementation black white image processing system desired domain model images passing series filters produce desired output 
assume important goals system easy develop maintain efficient memory 
need quickly develop bug free enhancements system 
images large order system efficient minimize memory storage requirements 

basic functionality achieving goal relatively easy 
old fashioned procedural programming implement system concisely alignment domain model 
approach filters defined procedures take input images produce single output image 
set primitive procedures implement basic filters higher level filters defined terms primitive ones 
example primitive 
filter takes images returns pixelwise logical implemented operation perform pixels defun 
result new image loop width loop height set pixel result get pixel get pixel result loop pixels input images storing pixels result image starting 
primitive filters programmer definition filter selects just black pixels horizontal edge returning new image consisting just boundary pixels 
chosen common lisp syntax presentation written fairly easily algol language 
functionality implementation pixelwise logical operations written loop primitive shift image written loop primitive slightly different loop structure difference images defun remove 


pixels top edge region defun top edge

pixels bottom edge region defun bottom edge

horizontal edge pixels defun horizontal edge 

top edge 
bottom edge 
note primitive filters deal explicitly looping pixels images 
higher level filters horizontal edge expressed cleanly terms primitive ones 
resulting code easy read reason debug extend short meets goal 

optimizing memory usage code doesn address second goal optimizing memory usage 
procedure called loops number input images produces new output image 
output images created frequently existing briefly consumed loop 
results excessively frequent memory storage allocation turn leads cache misses page faults terrible performance 
familiar solution problem take global perspective program map intermediate results inputs filters code version program fuses loops appropriately implement original functionality creating intermediate images possible 
revised code horizontal edge 
look operations component filters defun horizontal edge 
result new image 

loop width loop height set pixel result get pixel result get pixel get pixel get pixel result images created loop structure shared component filters compared original code tangled 
incorporates different filters horizontal edge 
defined terms fuses loops 
horizontal edge 
top edge

fused operations different looping structure 
short revising code efficient memory destroyed original clear functional structure 
course simple example difficult deal small amount tangled code 
real programs complexity due tangling quickly expands major obstacle ease code development maintenance 
real system example drawn important sub component optical character recognition system 
real system coding basic functionality simple style requires lines code optimized version fusion optimization memoization intermediate results compile time memory allocation specialized intermediate datastructures requires lines 
tangled code extremely difficult maintain small changes functionality require mentally re tangling 

cross cutting returning example code provides different basis understanding tangling

properties implemented functionality loop fusion originate primitive filters compose differently filters composed 
functionality composes hierarchically traditional way 
loop fusion composes fusing loops primitive filters loop structure producer consumer relationships runtime 
fusion relationship cuts functionality hierarchy fundamentally way appear local look dataflow graph 
cross cutting phenomena directly responsible tangling code 
single composition mechanism language provides procedure calling suited building un optimized functional units 
help compose functional units loop fusion simultaneously follow different composition rules compose 
unfortunately breakdown forces combine properties entirely hand happening tangled code 
general properties programmed compose differently coordinated say cross cut 
gp languages provide composition mechanism programmer composition manually leading complexity tangling code
