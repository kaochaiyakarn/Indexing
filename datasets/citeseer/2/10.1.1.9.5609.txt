introduce timbral similarity measures comparing music titles 
measure gaussian model cepstrum coefficients 
describe timbre extractor corresponding timbral similarity relation 
describe experiments assessing quality similarity relation show measure able yield interesting similarity relations particular conjunction similarity relations 
illustrate descriptor emd applications developed context european project 

domain electronic music distribution gained worldwide attention progress middleware network compression 
success emd depends largely existence robust perceptually relevant music similarity relations 
efficient content management techniques millions music titles produced society available millions users 
goal design implement music similarity measures allow users find quickly interesting music large catalogues popular music 
typical catalogues size titles 
term popular music denotes music largely distributed includes classical pop rock world sub varieties musical genres traditionally produced listened world

similarity relations type similarity difficult describe precisely words aim straightforward timbre descriptor look aims describing timbral quality applies song opposed particular point time instrument 
typical examples schumann classical bill evans piece jazz similar common romantic piano sound nick drake tune folk acoustic tune smashing rock bossa nova piece joao world similar consist simple acoustic guitar gentle male voice describe similarities sophisticated textual descriptors male voice romantic piano 
course descriptors deduced system task probably impossible achieve comments global similarity intrinsically unlabelled 
state art large quantity timbre 
focussed monophonic simple sound samples aiming instrument recognition identifying note played trumpet clarinet 
contrary concerned full polyphonic music complex instrumental textures want extract global timbre description 
related domain automatic genre classification tries categorize music titles genre classes looking spectral temporal signal features 
approach tested song timbre matched precomputed models possible genre 
genre model averages timbre large number songs known belong genre 
matching song song group songs 
music title identification deals identifying title artist arbitrary music signal 
done comparing unlabelled signal features database containing features possible identified songs 
case matching done song system looks exact matches similarity 
approach borrows techniques performs approximate matching song 
system uses mel frequency cepstrum coefficients modelled music similarity measures 
gaussian mixture models compared yield similarity measure 
foote presents system uses cepstral coefficients front uses supervised algorithm tree vector quantizer learns distinctive dimensions corpus 
adding song corpus requires redo learning tree expensive 
contrary system completely scalable models song separately 
welsh proposes query similarity system able match songs timbre 
uses large set features floating point song compared euclidian distance 
system doesn address timbre similarity explicitly features model pitch tonal content song returning songs key noise level pure classical music noisy saturated hard rock rhythm 
timbral similarity observed results author pop male vocal song produces results song top male vocal guitar drum accompaniment appears side effect features notably describing tonal content pieces 
system restrictive precise notably features meant independant pitch 
try model music similarity large timbral similarity 
similarity relationship rhythm melody style structure addressed welsh 
argue interestingness music retrieval system lies confrontation similarity relationships 
logan proposed similar approach uses cepstrum coefficients different modelling complex matching algorithm 
feature extraction signal cut points frames ms frame compute short time spectrum 
mel frequency cepstrum estimate spectral envelope frame 
spectral envelope signal curve frequency magnitude space envelopes peaks spectrum 
widely researched mentioned problem instrument recognition demonstrated feature explains large part timbre instruments 
cepstrum inverse fourier transform log spectrum 
cn log call mel cepstrum cepstrum computed non linear frequency warping psychoacoustic frequency scale mel scale 
cn called mel frequency cepstrum coefficients mfccs 
low order mfccs account slowly changing spectral envelope higher order ones describe fast variations spectrum 
obtain timbre measure independent pitch coefficients 
measured optimum dimension set coefficients 
shall coefficients 
gaussian mixture modelling feature extraction yields feature vector dimension frame believed compact representation local timbre frame 
typical minute song represented feature vectors coefficients compared data songs 
order reduce quantity variability data compared model distribution song mfccs mixture gaussian distributions space mfccs 
gaussian mixture model gmm estimates probability density weighted sum simpler gaussian densities called components states mixture 
ft cm ft feature vector observed time multivariate gaussian pdf mean vector covariance matrix cm mixture coefficient called state probability 
initialise gmm parameters mean clustering train model classic algorithm 
mixtures gaussian distributions proved sufficient model mfcc distribution songs 
distance models gaussian models match timbre different songs gives similarity measure audio content music 
ways distance computed 
likelihood match song timbre model song computing probability data model likelihood computing probability mfccs song generated model formula 
precise logical way compute distance requires access song mfcc relatively heavy compute store 
sampling assume don access songs mfcc want compute distance timbre models directly match models 
easy compute distance gaussian distributions instance classical kullback leibler distance trickier problem evaluate distance sets gaussian distributions gmm 
method chosen sample gmm compute likelihood samples gmm 
corresponds roughly re creating song timbre model applying likelihood method defined newly created song song model 
distances normalized symmetric 
approach suited large musical databases crucial store mfccs gmm parameters 
dimension gaussian distribution gmm represented floating point numbers mixture coefficient coefficients mean vector coefficients covariance matrix assumed diagonal 
times efficient storing mfccs
