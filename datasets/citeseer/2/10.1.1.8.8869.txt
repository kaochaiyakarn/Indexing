approaches automating support requirements 
browser interface requires changes html web pages 
proxy server modifies html accessible browser

approach allows finer control modifications provides platform experiment different mappings input signals action errors fatigue

existing looked low bandwidth input user interfaces

neill evaluation scanning user interfaces 
past proposed logical control low bandwidth input 
done word prediction limited signals mapped large space english language text commands 
build past focus web browsing task particular 
low bandwidth input investigation low bandwidth input associated interface issues web browsing 
user bandwidth measure information processing rate human input output channel 
bandwidth bits second function task difficulty task completion time 
difficulty measure number bits information processed 
task completion time increases difficulty remains bandwidth reduced 
words user takes longer complete task said complete lower bandwidth 
bandwidth influenced combination user application device interface choices affect bandwidth performance task 
additionally error rates impacted interface design may increase task completion times reduce bandwidth 
factor common low bandwidth input dwell time selection 
example system may follow link user selects seconds 
decreases bandwidth function dwell time 
low bandwidth input generally severe mismatch number input signals number interface elements user wants control 
single switch appropriate control single light room suited controlling entire house lights 
interface multiplex small number input signals large number controls support low bandwidth input 
unfortunately graphical user interfaces guis designed opposite expect user able select pixels screen narrow smaller set functions menus buttons links 
approaches available addressing mismatch input signals interface discussed 
powerful tool reducing necessary input bandwidth logical control 
logical control refers accessing specific functions supported application directly 
stands contrast direct manipulation user navigates screen menu selects menu selects item 
shortcut ctrl save document example 
example hierarchical interface user progressively chooses specific items 
trade offs mouse motion slow difficult logical control important alternative 
focus logical control paradigm 
alternative logical control physical control low bandwidth input simulate standard physical input device 
logical control applied generally far elements control input signals 
tool help handle mismatch prediction 
prediction refers interfaces infer user trying order reduce number choices number inputs necessary select 
example mobile phone users phone keyboard multiplexes entire alphabet keys uses dictionary bigrams disambiguate user types 
word prediction mentioned example developed originally motor impaired users applied support cognitive disabilities users mainstream devices applications including pdas web browsers 
prediction logical control reduce number screen elements user interact 
techniques scanning wrapping increase number screen elements single switch select 
scanning interfaces move focus control grid sequentially automatically item item standard timeout moves 
user needs switch triggers execute currently selected item 
example grid contain alphabet execution equivalent typing letter clicking soft keyboard 
shows scanning logical control 
physical scanning interface follows mouse cursor moves horizontally user signals causes click motion begins 
wrapping halve number signals needed control mouse traverse line table items 
case user normally needs bidirectional signal left right wrapping allows substitution unidirectional signal move right example 
wrapping place user reaches edge line selection wraps line 
needs switch directions eventually reach point passed 
reduces number signals needed increases average access time item 
wrapping physical logical control 
wrapping differs scanning user controls motion 
focus logical control position mouse physical control changes user produces signal user produces signal 
discussion far focused issues layout control

means confirmation dialogs ways avoiding errors critical especially chance error systems side high 
errors distributed unevenly set available inputs mapping signal task impact number errors need corrected input bandwidth
