studies show locality awareness networks improve efficiency significantly clustering users geographical locality file requests answered faster 
similarly clustering types files peers called interest locality may improve search performance may reduce duration search phase general specifically searching rare files :10.1.1.12.7728

edonkey network hybrid layer network composed clients servers 
clients connect server register files sharing providing meta data describing files 
registered clients search querying meta data request particular file unique network identifier 
servers provide locations files requested clients clients download files directly provided locations
