properties various web annotation systems 
critlink web annotation system information stored standard html documents created accessed normal ways 
critlink approach annotation problem interesting uncommon just providing annotations augments hyperlink primitive yield new possibilities web current hypertext model annotations just application 
advanced hyperlinks section describes detail hyperlinking features highlighted enabled critlink significance online collaboration 
bi directional links web currently supports links joining anchors origin location containing tag target location identified href attribute 
hyperlinks web usually followed origin target general links origin current document visible links targeting current document shown 
bi directional links hyperlinks followed direction 
ability find works referring document important synthesizing information various documents 
extrinsic links html links intrinsic meaning embedded linked document 
consequently author document link document 
support better collaboration possible parties contribute links relating document documents 
links stored outside document called extrinsic 
typed links link joins anchors useful know kind relationship represents anchors 
information help user agents provide appropriate means displaying interacting link 
html provides rel rev attributes hyperlinks purpose unfortunately ignored common browsers 
fine grained links coarse grained anchor addresses entire document fine grained anchor addresses specific part document 
specification html allows kinds origin anchors link tags respectively popular web browsers ignore link tags 
urls support kinds anchors fine grained target anchor identify fragment marked target document 
author target document operated marking fragment web browsers neglect indicate position fragment 
scroll user view approximate location nearby leaving user guess fragment lies 
requirement ordination link creator target document author failure display fragments renders fine grained targets largely useless collaboration purposes 
summary current web software properly supports untyped intrinsic way links fine grained origin anchors coarse grained target anchors 
result readers interact contribute documents 
inaccuracy document corrected reader noticed re corrected new reader related supporting material document suggested reader new reader leading incomplete information wasted time 
applications ability follow links backward useful applied vast collection existing links web 
easier find related essential part collaborating 
typed fine grained links permit web document variation existing document 
link serve change marker indicate delta existing version document suggested revision 
linking features taken enable public annotation critical discussion 
links followed backwards annotation simply ordinary web document link annotated document 
extrinsic links permit annotate document requiring operation author 
finegrained target anchor lets annotation refer particular phrase document 
typed links annotation specify relationship disposition respect target document 
annotations just ordinary documents annotated protected security mechanisms ordinary web documents 
user experience critlink tool viewing authoring annotations 
augments browsing experience mediating transactions browser server requiring extra software installed 
pages downloaded server critlink adjusts hyperlinks page request pages critlink mediator 
session user directs web browser crit org 
user browse web links normally entering new urls secondary location bar provided critlink 
pages augmented extra toolbar top annotation markers inserted content metadata backward links document 
example shows acm home page appears viewed critlink 
selecting target text case pioneering conferences pressing comment button brings composition window 
comment entered indicator icons appear original page bracketing target text hovering icon pops title annotation shown 
selecting icon displays annotation shown 
document metadata lists fine grained coarse grained backlinks appear bottom page shown 
particular example demonstrates reader construct trail web adding public links documents reader

critlink toolbar provides monitor button visible figures 
button allows user register notifications new link document discovered 
author document know document annotated 
user creates new annotation critlink automatically registers user monitor annotation user notified replies user comment 
implementation critlink provides extrinsic linking maintaining external database hyperlinks indexes links target location support bi directional traversal 
updates database finds new links browsed pages 
typed links supported respecting rel rev attributes links providing assistance setting attributes new annotations created 
single extension standard syntax enables location fine grained anchors target document 
standard urls permit name anchor character url named anchor marked author target document 
critlink additionally understands urls specify sequence words search target document 
label words signals extension 
example example com doc html words blue dog identifies anchor position blue appears part phrase blue dog text document located example com doc html
