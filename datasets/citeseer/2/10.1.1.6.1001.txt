auction mechanism samp sb mechanism comprises set auctions 
auctions run simultaneously asynchronously independently direct coordination 
agents interact auctions submitting bids goods wish buy sell

offer buy units unit refer buy offer 
offer sell units unit refer sell offer 
agent buys sells task dependency network bid contains positive negative quantity offers 
bids possess called additive semantics offers treated exactly came separate bids auction match individual offers independently 
loss generality henceforth impose restriction offers bids continuing allow agents may submit multiple offers bid 
auction receives new bid sends bidders price quote specifying price result auction ended current bid state 
price quotes issued initial bids received subsequently issued immediately receipt new bids 
offers may tied current price information sufficient agent tell winning offer placed price 
clarify ambiguity price quote reports bidder quantity buy sell current state 
prices sent bidders reported winning state specific recipient 
agents may choose revise bids response notifications agent wish change bid inaction leaves previous bid standing auction 
assume communication reliable asynchronous 
messages sent eventually reach recipients impose bound delays 
agents auctions message ids ensure handle messages appropriate order 
note auctions agents deterministic behaviors run samp sb may nondeterministic due asynchrony 

technically adopt model asynchronous reliable message passing systems fagin 
walsh wellman asynchrony helpful auction send id bid received agent price quote 
agent responds price quote reflects bid sent 
device agent difficulty establishing feasibility understanding input output bid states may nonuniformly delayed reports 
bidding continues quiescence state messages received agent chooses revise bids auction changes prices ask prices allocation

producer complementary inputs ensuring feasibility challenging problem requiring careful design 
auctions run simultaneously auction requires prices agent successive buy offers increase generally small positive number prices successive sell offers increase auction enforce ascending rule simply rejecting agent offer price increase constraining direction price changes design gives producers accurate indication relative prices inputs outputs prices allowed fluctuate directions 
ascending bid restriction ensures ascending auction prices technicality 
due asynchrony immediate issuance price quotes initial bid agent arrives higher bid price quote decrease

assume producer initially offers zero input goods gradually increases offers ensure feasibility
