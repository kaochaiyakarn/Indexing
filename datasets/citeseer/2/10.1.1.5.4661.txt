zariski spaces project zariski spaces zariski spaces introduced 
order understand spaces needs rst understand zariski topologies 
broad sense topologies prime factorizations 
example zariski topology associated ring integers consists sets called varieties prime ideals set integer 
particular variety integer set ideals generated respectively prime factors 
note divide ideal generated ideal generated contain ideal generated 
general case commutative ring unity denote collection prime ideals possibly empty subset variety fp pg easily shown collection varieties constitutes closed sets topology called zariski topology denote turns topology semiring takes operations addition multiplication set theoretic intersection union respectively 
module repeat process 
say denote collection prime submodules subset variety fp pg represent collection varieties subsets show seldom forms topology form semiring operation taken intersection scalar multiplication rab
