computational ontology data integration emerging major challenge early st century

laboratory designed built tool called supports integration transformation databases having schemas dtd xml schema format soon extended kinds schema 
fully automatic schema mapping generation infeasible tool attempts minimize total user effort identifying critical decision points user input yield largest reduction matching effort 
difficulties schema integration include highly variable structure quality data meta data science labs businesses data stored spreadsheets just formatted files little documentation format meaning entries may incomplete corrupted inconsistent

cognitive science section reviews research cognitive science help evaluate potential ontology 
discuss cognitivism receding movement arose restrictive worldview tried study behavior invoking mind 
cognitivism broad sense mind seriously fact cognitivist research takes narrow view cognition considered computation body emotion society neglected representation knowledge emerges central problem 
classic form called old fashioned ai gofai knowledge represented symbolic logic approach logical vienna circle presumably endorsed 
conspicuous failure approach japanese fifth generation project inspired number biologically motivated refinements neural nets called artificial life abandon computational model solve problem representation precisely formulated symbol grounding problem stated solved harnad issue symbolic representations computational model come refer real world 
information processing models cognitivism appear adequate formalized games chess exclusion cursory treatment embodiment emotion society render unsatisfactory theory means human 
late eleanor rosch began systematic experimental study categorization prevalent ideas propositional nature 
brief basic level categories bird determined similarity prototypes expanded radially analogies 
research summarized foundation conceptual metaphor theory abbreviated cmt george lakoff greatly deepened understanding metaphor 
result metaphors come families called image schemas share common pattern 
example better feeling today moving management goals higher 
image schemas including grounded human body called basic image schemas tend yield persuasive metaphors 
image schemas occur music example high voices instantiates better schema 
turner studied blending conceptual integration claiming basic human cognitive operation invisible effortless fundamental pervasive appearing construction understanding metaphors cognitive phenomena including grammar reasoning 
simple examples blends word phrases jazz piano computer virus classical composer 
blending theory says concepts come clusters called conceptual spaces consisting elements relation instances note abstraction necessarily omits qualitative experiential aspects represented 
conceptual mappings partial functions item relation instances space 
simplest blends form called input source grounded experience gravity schema grounded everyday experiences beer glass pile level goes state prefer image schema discussed basic 
diagram upside turner arrows go spaces called blend space generic space contains conceptual structure shared input spaces consists space conceptual mappings may relatively interesting 
additional principles needed identifying interesting possibilities define blend optimal respect principles 
turner suggest number optimality principles purpose see chapter vague easily formalized applicable sense blends poetic blends 
cmt view metaphor maps aspects domain target domain concerns metaphor blending theory views metaphors cross space mappings arise blending conceptual spaces 
example understanding love rose involves blending spaces love rose identifying love rose blend creates correspondence items input spaces 
blend diagram mathematical definition blend modification category theoretic notion pushout takes advantage ordering relation morphisms respect quality 
notion blending give unique result

semiotic system semiotic theory consists signature gives names sorts subsorts operations axioms level ordering sorts having maximum element called top sort priority ordering constructors level constructors operations build new signs parts priority ordering axioms 
sorts classify parts signs data sorts provide values attributes signs color size 
axioms constraints possible signs system 
levels express part hierarchy complex signs priorities express relative importance constructors arguments social issues play important role determining orderings 
approach rich mathematical foundation signature plus equational axioms algebraic theory large literature 
conceptual spaces correspond special case semiotic theories sort operations representing atomic elements relations axioms assert relation holds certain constants 
representations uniform mappings signs source space signs target space 
formalize sign systems algebraic theories additional structure formalize semiotic morphisms mappings theories preserve additional structure mappings partial general sorts constructors preserved real examples 
example semiotic morphism rose space blend space metaphor love rose omits insects possibly preserving thorns 
addition structure algebraic theories semiotic morphisms partially preserve priorities levels source space 
extent morphism preserves various features semiotic theories important determinant quality 
simple form blend applies just semiotic spaces semiotic morphisms case called structural blend blending extends multiple spaces morphisms

ethnomethodology traditional social science methods stand outside situation applying methods different group members sense world 
part reflects misunderstanding research hard sciences quantum measurements necessarily disturb system measured modern philosophy science claims measurements theory laden 
ethnomethodology argues social scientists sense making methods group members denies analysts unique access objectivity 
example study music transcribing western music modern western tone equal tempered scale may conclude micro tonal scales flawed primitive 
fact musicians highly accomplished methods teaching music musical theory scales rhythms structures correct orient twelfth root 
ethnomethodology outgrowth conversation analysis consider social order accomplished members moment moment interactions 
example word seminar suggests pre existing category fact constructed members room certain arrangement chairs orientation understood speaker long turn speaker idea member categories find categories members order word sort avoid ambiguities heavily overloaded word type social world impose analyst order 
fundamental idea social world orderly order going creation participants 
don know advance relevant categories come data pre coding scheme 
implicit notion members categories organising activity analysts reconstruct intentions mental processes far evident involved activity 
analysts simply construct subjects mental models intentions 
necessary demonstrate participants doing allows participants infer intentions 
activity analyst postulating intentions different participants proceeds evidence

sociology science brilliant book classification systems bowker star demonstrates intensely political ethical aspects malleability evolution local interpretation 
examples considered include racial classification south african international classification diseases nursing intervention classification 
systems hardly resemble neat equivalence relations pure mathematics computer science 
contrary inherently ambiguous typically anomalous cases classified highly political embody values require ongoing apply maintain invisible done committees 
phenomena highlighted ignored people suffer boundaries shift property tax rates change 
infamous case south african jazz musician times serious personal consequences 
countries delayed recognizing severity aids political reasons 
part summary seen book people information systems build routinely conflate formal informal prototypical aristotelian aspects classification 
thing unambiguous uniform classification system 
deeper goes spaces classification expertise example librarianship botanical systematics finds debates rival classificatory schools 
research data integration seen taxonomists arguing length appear small points 
philosophy traditional approaches categorization tend experience 
attaching formal label real entity necessarily omits enormous amount relevant information 
example score spectral analysis capture nuances actual musical performance include particular actions particular musicians musical instruments listeners rooms 
approach avoiding problems reify notion context 
ethnomethodologists emphasize context dynamically emergent activity fixed definable advance formally representable separable activity 
speak situated actions occasions action contextualized representations situations contexts specifiable representable stable separable actual uses
