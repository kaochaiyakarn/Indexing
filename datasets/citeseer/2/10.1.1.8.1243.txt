describes approach automatic web page classification yahoo hierarchy 
machine learning techniques developed learning text data hierarchical classification structure 
high number features reduced account hierarchical structure feature subset selection method known information retrieval 
documents represented feature vectors include grams including single words unigrams commonly learning text data 
hierarchical structure problem divided subproblems representing categories included yahoo hierarchy 
result learning set independent classifiers predict probability new example member corresponding category 
experimental evaluation real world data shows proposed approach gives results 
half testing examples correct category categories highest predicted probability 
yahoo known web pages hierarchy human constructed designed human web browsing 
classified documents build hierarchy web documents making hierarchy biased human knowledge areas represented web documents 
yahoo hierarchy top category regional currently built web documents located internet world 
refer documents actual web documents 
hyperlinks documents organized yahoo web documents document represents included categories documents representing general categories closer root hierarchy 
yahoo documents connected hyperlinks forming hierarchical structure

top level yahoo categorization level subcategories science approximate number documents category site uk ireland nov 
currently fourteen top level yahoo categories name includes keyword

experimental results experiments performed developed machine learning system learning machine supports usage different machine learning techniques large data sets especially designed modules learning text collecting data web 
experiments observe influence different numbers features vector size feature vector document representation independent set computers internet smaller domains testing examples selected randomly actual web documents accessible hierarchy domain 
get categorization results set independent classifiers potentially having different number features 
express vector size factor number features positive examples set negative examples classifiers 
way classifier larger category features classifier smaller category classifying testing example 
testing example observe list categories assigned probability result consulting corresponding subproblem classifier 
sorting categories probability gives ranking get rank correct category 
testing example report rank probability assigned correct category 
get summary results testing examples give median lower upper quartile testing examples non typical category containing welcome page sentence asking language preference error message page giving redirection 
report results naive bayesian classifier domains representing top yahoo categories having categories grams grams grams grams grams features education having categories features computers internet having categories features 
domains best performance achieved small number features features selected odds ratio scoring measure suggested 
specifically median correct category rank median correct category probability testing examples rank assigned correct category probability returned correct category classifier showing confidence example member correct category 
education computers internet median correct category rank median correct category probability testing examples rank assigned correct category probability 
vector sizes lower quartile rank probability meaning testing examples highest rank assigned correct category probability 
education computers internet vector sizes lower quartile rank probability
