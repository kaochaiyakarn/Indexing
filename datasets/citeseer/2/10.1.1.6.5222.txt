approach problem build initial plan expected behavior various activities attempt improve plan augmenting contingent branches 
approach bresina swanson justin case telescope scheduling 
approach intuitively simple appealing extending problems outlined non trivial 
primary difficulty decide contingent branches added plan 
scheduling branches added points greatest probability plan failure 
distributions time resource usage relatively easy calculate statistical simulation plan 
unfortunately points fail necessarily points useful alternatives available 
points maximal failure probability may late plan time power left useful alternative 
efficient approach identify earliest point time predict confidence failure going occur 
unfortunately problem finding high utility branch points non trivial 
shows expected utility time possible plans single branch fixed starting energy 
note earlier start times plans highest expected utility postpone decision primary plan possibility receiving reward nir action accurately assessed 
seconds expected utility gained immediately branch dominates plan succeed started primary plan 
value function branch drops sharply relatively little uncertainty duration plan 
time advances value branching apparent 
late branches look better time short chance earlier action happen unusually quickly allowing primary plan completed 
late branches perform worse hires rarely time remaining action complete plan 
plans dominate little time available hires branch 
finding branch conditions decided plan problem deciding conditions take branch 
dynamic programming compute optimal conditions suffers problems described
