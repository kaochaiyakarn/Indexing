rts packet received correctly receiver acknowledges sending cts packet back sender performing task virtual carrier sensing mechanism receiver 
rts cts packets silence neighbors sender receiver respectively time required ensuing data packet transmission 
successful rts cts exchange guarantees high probability success data packet 
rts cts packets suffer collisions smaller data packets collisions usually smaller concern data packets 
additional overhead rts cts transmissions significant large number rts cts collisions retransmissions attempts heavy traffic conditions 
key advantage multiple channels multiple transmissions neighborhood distributed different channels leading lower contention higher throughput due potentially smaller number backoffs collisions retransmissions

consider packet arrival times nodes ta tc td respectively 
transmissions performed single channel nodes find channel busy times packet transmissions backoff random time intervals eventually transmitted 
hand channels available node capable finding free channel transmission need backoffs 
average channel utilization throughput scenario better channels aggregate channel capacity cases 
mention points concern efficiency multiple channels 
firstly number transmitting nodes higher number available channels contention backoffs avoided 
performance multiple channels case depend channels selected 
efficient channel selection scheme distribute transmissions different channels times provide comparatively higher throughput scheme single channel bandwidth 
secondly multiple channels quality clarity transmissions vary channels 
particularly important wireless quality transmission depends signal interference plus noise ratio sinr receiver 
multi channel mac protocols channel selection schemes achieving desired levels quality specific qos constraints simultaneously maximize utilization available bandwidth 
lastly noted total aggregate bandwidth multi channel protocol bandwidth gets reduced 
leads higher packet transmission times cause negative effect throughput backoffs multichannel scheme
