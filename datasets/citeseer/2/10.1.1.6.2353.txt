private public key encryption goal encryption securely send information parties untrusted channel 
conventional private key encryption parties possess secret key input encrypting decrypting message 
goal adversary discover contents encrypted message secret key 
public key encryption uses separate keys 
key public 
parties want communicate sender encrypt message receiver public key 
second key kept private 
receiving message receiver decrypts message private key 
assumed public key give information private key
