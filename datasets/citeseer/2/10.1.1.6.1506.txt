activation spreads chunks related chunks spreading activation network 
spreading activation network amount activation accumulating goal chunks display chunks indicator mutual relevance 
spreading activation network content mutual relevance user goals contents calculated time display changes 
amount activation evaluate select productions 
activation content dependent chunks matched production rules determine utility selecting production rules dynamically
