despite wide ranging research embodied conversational agents currently underway accumulating tools methodologies allow prototype new embodied conversational agents 
aims add new element repertoire template specifications embodied conversational behavior 
templates common form natural language generation technology particularly text applications 
templates successful easier simply lists kinds sentences system needs constructing general theory application language 
typically template combines static sequence words gaps filled rule 
different sentences constructed template filling gaps conditionally available data 
sophisticated systems text constructed templates recursively system choose templates expand condi context 
reiter offers motivation functionality templates applied systems language interaction specifically considers template generation context spoken dialogue agents 
coding animation system possible extend templates produce specifications embodied conversational behavior 
template indicate prosody utterance delivered template spell concurrent actions facial displays gestures 
templates number simple conversational programs construct utterance specifications ruth rutgers university talking head system animates symbolic specifications facial displays head movements synchrony visible speech 
animation systems accept symbolic specifications including gesture expect techniques apply systems

templates achieve coverage required broad system prohibitive effort templates limit kinds roles personalities agents achieve templates unique role prototyping embodied conversational agents framing models social agency classroom instruction 
motivating templates proposing template generation aim easier construct conversational agents animated bodies express way adds say 
challenge agents consistent contributions conversation actions fit coherent 
natural conversation coherence derives ability recognize partners beliefs intentions indirectly defeasible evidence actions provide 
unfortunately easy formalize inference productive way

dialogue fragment imagine guest dinner host just served dessert 
reports finding dessert bit overwhelming

head uses speech responses carry quite different implications dialogue dinner 
facial signals polite explanation choice dessert possible suggestion preferences dessert go waste 
contrast facial signals stern party guests accept chocolate eat enjoy 
course difference interpretation sense 
conversational signals utterances show utterance reports surprising contrast reply expected reports obstacle goals change necessary

specific functions conversational signals follow part inference resolving ambiguities interpretation 
contribution signal may determine intended disambiguation radical effects meaning 
options realize utterances individual basis 
performance animation possibility 
conversational systems include capability realize completely canned specifications animation alongside selective generative synthesis 
generative ways existing architectures explore subtleties behavior illustrated 
example pelachaud cassell animate raised eyebrows emphasis predicting rule representation linguistic form 
apply linguistic form 
randomizing behaviors perlin seminal distinguish alternative replies 
successful applications built text see conversational behaviors best redundant text 
hope eventually generate strategy poggi allows actions may add meaning utterance rules generate eyebrow raises underlying representation agent intentions discourse 
architecture implementation possible abstractions agents communicative intentions behaviors achieve 
initially may just specific intuitions agent 
templates offer compromise reconciling content agent affect making system building easier practicable expense generality 
template abstracts away specific utterance reused productive range circumstances 
template builds specific utterance understand intuitively template retain substantial part linguistic structure utterance consequently preserve implicit semantic connections give utterance coherent unified interpretation context 
example suppose dialogue forms abstracting away nouns dessert chocolate 
utterance reduces reply synchronized brow raise head turn synchronized nod 
represent utterances limited abstraction way expect instances get parallel interpretations spelling general purpose mechanisms conversational agents recognize produce interpretations 
implementation explore ideas implemented simple template mechanism embodied conversational interaction

templates structure instantiation templates produce input ruth rutgers university talking head 
input consists text marked specify intonation facial conversational signals 
ruth uses phonetic structure input utterance derive schedule animation instructions lip synch additional nonverbal actions 
renders instructions applying deformations polygonal mesh part coarticulation model speech 
ruth combine conversational actions autonomous behaviors general believe control compatible template structures methodology developed 
specify prosody ruth uses tones break indices tobi model english intonation 
tobi prosodic structure described terms phrasing clustering words groups delimited perceived accentuation perceived prominence particular syllables group words 
intonational tune specified symbolic annotations describe qualitative behavior pitch accents phrasal boundaries 
english tonal inventory includes pitch accents high low rising accents differ rise precedes follows stressed syllable 
words grouped hierarchical levels prosodic phrasing english smaller intermediate phrase larger intonation phrase 
intermediate phrase marked high low tone immediately accented syllable phrase intonation phrase additionally marked high low tone phrase 
common patterns intonation phrases include fall declarative statements rise questions combined fall rise associated generally contributions incomplete 
ruth animates brow raises smiles translations rotations head 
conversational signals occur single accented syllable span prosodic constituent level intermediate phrase higher see 
specify head movements small set qualitative values including rotations left right nods tilting motions clockwise counterclockwise 
embodied conversational agent template consist text gap marked specific realization 
order produce input ruth templates spell prosodic structure ruth requires respect ruth constraints conversational signals 
constraints treatment gaps particularly important 
filling gap system distinctions material fills gap accented reduced contrastive context 
possibility give adjective filler contrastive accent highlighting status number alternative possible backgrounds utterance 
filler template accented example filler evokes agreed topic utterance provides continuation 
gap falls boundary prosodic phrase embedded entirely single larger unit 
filler marks boundary decorated accordingly appropriate specifications onset phrases set pitch range initiate appropriate specifications ends phrases introduce boundary tones ongoing nonverbal 
ongoing events explicitly associated gap 
brow raise head turn example marked filler filler gap realized nonverbal 
possible accented fillers

simultaneous speech allows different signals different utterances respond agents take interaction 
ultimately roles programs apparently project illusions programmers imagined designed interface

described templates embodied conversational agents 
templates utterance specifications combine static descriptions words synchronized behaviors gaps filled rule 
implement templates effectively control combined realization text fillers way allows flexible delivery filler respects natural synchrony speech nonverbal behavior 
templates effectively consider specific embodied utterances fit design clear interpretation away utterances restricted way preserves connections language action frame disambiguate interpretation 
see template generation techniques important tool developing embodied conversational agents complements canned utterances full generative synthesis 
applications may suffice templates may readily implemented combining canned responses templates deep generation techniques 
templates merged behavior animation techniques provided templates contain additional specifications actions altered ways 
particularly intrigued prospect introducing field embodied conversational agents students template generation 
preparing templates students focus developing detailed descriptions utterances conversation gaining informal appreciation general principles give utterances meaning 
time preparing templates gives students satisfaction creating interactive systems play systems may react unexpected ways 
generally highlighting simplicity challenge creating embodied conversational agents templates hope lower barriers entry research area add momentum
