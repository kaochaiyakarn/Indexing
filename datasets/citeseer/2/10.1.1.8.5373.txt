traditional formal theories knowledge action stress conception knowledge corresponding know knowledge facts know knowledge skills 
assumed know reduced know 
briefly review arguments know important reduced 
argue internal structure groups neglected traditional theories important 
formal model successively better definitions know group 
definition involves notion strategies defined ways may reactively followed 
argue structure group best captured terms strategic reactive interactions members 
briefly consider example theory proposed may applied 
list important formal consequences theory 
largely focuses clarification formalization intuitions structure ability groups successful extent captures intuitions provides framework technical development 
briefly seeks identify external objective requirements ascription know groups intelligent agents 
external mean requirements determined behavior agents claims internal structure shall restrict agents symbolic knowledge bases facts reason general purpose inference engine consequence approach theory require group agents mutual beliefs common knowledge cooperate 
common knowledge impossible achieve realistic scenarios communication known guaranteed finite delay 
groups traditional theories multiagent intentions action tend ignore structure group agents considered assume agents equally capable perfectly cooperative 
knowledge skills group depend greatly structure knowledge skills members 
consider football team includes pass pass receiver trying move ball yards 
team knows play opponent say members required skills throw receiver catch 
players know combine yield know team 
internal structure team matters 
players cooperate receiver exchange positions team may know play individual abilities remain unchanged 
analogously team may know best throw ball situation may receiver 
individual players knowledge skills surface influence knowledge skills group play specific positions cooperate interact bring skills 
structure group agents emerges collective actions performed members 
providing formal action theory structure group agents methodologically advantageous consider just actions done actions may potentially done 
words need consider ability know group agents 
propose consider abilities groups agents define structure group terms members act interact 
approach allows model externally commitments members goals model groups members partially cooperative adversaries 
opposing football teams interact ability teams score goal reduced team just walk straight ball goal 
observations order 
group sports team may considered single unstructured monolithic agent groups corporate persons hamblin term pp 

know group agents kind thing know individual agents difference extent typically expect cooperative group greater know proper subgroups 
consequence groups business corporations may recursively contain groups 
groups teams corporations monolithic homogeneous members group may just different abilities different contributions know group depending manner participate

know attribute intelligence agents act effectively 
agents act difficult assign knowledge facts arbitrarily interpreting internal states say sunflower knows sun certain direction turns point way

approach leads view know described 
unfortunately approach formally elegant embodies unrealistic assumptions problems outlined 
traditional theory predicates 
traditionally agent knows achieve doing action description iff knows achieves execute 
quantifying action descriptions notation model current situation result predicate giving result executing plan situation obtain ffl iff execute result 
agent proves yield explicitly represents knowledge required instantiate execute 
theory spirit requires agents group mutual beliefs shared plans may execute 
problems traditional reduction problems reduction urgent group know considered 
major shortcomings considered 

multiagent systems traditional theories plans typically consider single agent plans account know group agents 
organizations know certain things may explicit plan 
organizations actual actions taken individual agents knowledge may easily combined 
reduction members know strong just members know weak 

reactivity reduction stresses explicitly represented action descriptions plans 
know reactive football team may know score goal plan guarantee explicitly represented interpreted 
conditional plan eventualities moves opponent team wind drag ball anticipated 

basic actions skills traditional accounts assign basic actions agents situations
