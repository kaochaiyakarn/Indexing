visitors interests visitor types identify visitor preferences museums seek identify target groups individuals share common traits culture ethnic social affiliation educational level leisure preferences 
curators designers need assess basic knowledge expectations groups able reach communicate stimulate curiosity visitors 
eleanor hooper identifies target groups include families school parties organized educational groups leisure learners tourists elderly people visual auditory mobility learning disabilities hooper 
suggests partition museum resources target attract entertain different groups 
personal interview rosenthal director mit museum described sophisticated visitor type classification

category includes calls casual visitors people move gallery quickly heavily involved see 
casual visitors leisure time museums strong stimulus motivation deepen knowledge objects display 
second group cursory visitors show genuine interest museum experience collections 
dean visitors respond strongly specific objects stimulate curiosity wander gallery search stimulus closer exploration objects interest 
read label absorb available information occasionally read spend time selected areas selected objects encounter galleries 
third group minority visitors thoroughly examine detail attention 
learners spend abundance time galleries read text labels closely examine objects 
dean attributes differences people rush people people study different prior experiences educational level 
states important museums equipped communicate interest visitors scaling designing exhibit offers entertainment opportunity deepen knowledge learners 
divides visitors types transient sampler methodical viewers 
notes currently museum evaluators terms browsers characterize museum visitors styles looking exhibits 
concludes type categorization useful summative evaluation suggesting subjective method classification fruitful try create serve different styles visiting 
suggests objective means classification needs average time spent exhibition space 
accordance simplified museum visitor typology suggested dean museum wearable identifies main visitor types 
offer intuitive understanding types renamed busy selective greedy visitor type

called sto ry 
sto ry uses graphical probabilistic modeling story fragments participant input gathered sensors tell story user function estimated intentions desires interaction 
approach coarse noisy sensor inputs path length stops location sensors coupled digital media outputs user model estimated probabilistically bayesian network 
bayesian network graphical model encodes probabilistic relationships variables interest pearl jordan 
graphs provide attractive means modeling communicating complex structures form basis efficient algorithms propagating evidence learning parameters 
bayesian networks encode qualitative influences variables addition numerical parameters probability distribution

adaptive sto ry adaptive ways adapts individual users ensemble visitors particular exhibit 
individuals visitor exhibits initial greedy behavior system adapt visitor change behavior 
important notice reasonably appropriately system changes mind user type inertia initially lower probability greedy type types gain probability 
sto ry adapt collective body users

suddenly greedy type starts making short stops system concluding visitor selective busy type test current time near closing time museum galleries room sensors great crowd galleries visitor making short stops
