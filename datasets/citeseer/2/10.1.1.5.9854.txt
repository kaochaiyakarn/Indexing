causal relations expressed english 
causative constructions played important role history linguistics mainly study involves interaction various components linguistic description including semantics syntax morphology 
section concerned various linguistic expressions causality english texts 
causative construction involves components cause ect 
consider example bus fails turn 
result am late meeting 
example cause represented bus failing turn ect late meeting 
english causative constructions explicit implicit 
usually explicit causal patterns contain relevant keywords cause ect consequence implicit causative constructions complex involving inference semantic analysis background knowledge 
explicit causative constructions linguists consider explicit cause ect patterns expressed english texts ways causal connectives causative verbs conditionals causative adverbs adjectives 
causal connectives 
compilation works greenbaum halliday hassan quirk classi ed causal connectives types adverbial causal link prepositional causal link subordination clause integrated link adverbial causal links reason result constructions link clauses order form causal relationship 
types anaphoric link link 
anaphoric link back element preceding discourse example meaning word vary great deal depending context 
reason pocket dictionaries limited 
link ahead element preceding discourse 
instance labor government came power stalled process result countries opening membership negotiations eu march 
prepositional causal links due usually link noun phrase clause noun phrases apposition local man kept ight book carrying 
health problems due global warming predicted increase century 
subordination causal links classi ed subcategories resultative conjunctions colonies came realize separate england started revolutionary war 
structural link non nite ing clause cloudy experiment postponed 
correlative comparative construction trac heavy couldn arrive time 
causal link category link part subject called thematic link predicate clause link new satellite named ying bird

causative verbs 
linguists focused attention causative verbal constructions mainly study involves interaction formal syntax semantic analysis language 
rst important accepted classi cation causative verbs done soviet linguists analysis large number natural languages 
proposed lexical decomposition tries build taxonomy causative verbs de ne causal link causal link plus components states airs causally related simple causative cause lead bring generate force allow linking verb refers causal link synonymous verb cause 
example earthquakes generate waves 
resultative causatives kill melt dry break drop verbs refer causal link plus part resulting situation 
instrumental causatives poison killing poisoning hang punch clean causatives express part causing event result 
general characterization verbal causative constructions linguist introduced new semantic classi cation universally accepted linguistics community analytic causatives causatives morphological causatives lexical causatives analytical causative describes separate verb associated causative meaning 
usually verb se di erent related meaning 
example verb occur causative verb construction homework main verb right homework 
cited classes analytical causatives ne semantic distinctions get homework 
got homework 
homework 
morphological causatives single words causative meaning conveyed special morpheme morphological process 
english suf xes en ify form morphological causatives verify lexical causative takes words kill feed appear direct semantic relationship verbs die eat causative relation receives formal expression 
common semantic distinction drawn classi cation goddard direct indirect causation 
showed lexical causatives kill break imply direct causality nearest analytic versions cause die break 
greater linguistic distance elements representing cause ect greater conceptual distance 

conditionals 
conditionals typically expressed english sentences form antecedent consequent 
state airs described antecedent asserted sucient condition circumstance described consequent rains stay home 
conditionals english may express necessary sucient conditions may express causality temporal succession 
john studies pass exam 
john didn pass couldn studied 
conditionals complex linguistic structures express inferences 
ered new indepth analysis english conditional sentences 
classi es conditional constructions modality shows basic meaning parameters correlate formal parameters linguistic constructions express 
theory conditionals aims give account conditional construction explains conditional judgments acceptable inferences involving conditionals inferences linguistic construction important 
despite intensive great ingenuity remains highly controversial subject 

causative adverbs adjectives 
cresswell cresswell showed adverbs adjectives causal element meaning 
example wounded caesar 
caesar wound fatal 
cresswell classi ed causal adverbs categories adverbs perception visibly adverbs marginally perceptual manifestly patently publicly adverbs involve notion result properties context dependent successfully plausibly conveniently pleasantly adverbs suggest tendencies liabilities disposition adverbs refer ects gratefully consequently painfully adverbs means mechanically magically showed classi cation english language provides ways expressing cause ect relations 
linguistic patterns ambiguous referring speci relation particular context 
attempt automatic detection extraction causal relations text deal disambiguation corresponding causative constructions 
implicit causative constructions complex nominals verbs implicit causality discourse structure 
complex nominals expressing causality 
complex nominals represent dicult problems natural language understanding mainly require complex semantic analysis 
complex nominals noun phrases formed succession nouns adjectives instance english teacher mun mortgage rate analysis construction dicult ambiguity relation exists underlying nouns 
general lexical unit prove ambiguous sense 
interpretation semantic structure dicult due fact semantic relation constituents formally indicated 
able interpret adequately knowledge related semantic content components way relate required 
relations link nouns complex nominal causal relation 
complex nominals express causality types decreasing order ambiguity complex nominals implicit causal relationship 
dicult type requires inference semantic analysis world knowledge 
np np np causes np cold np np np causes np malaria complex nominals explicit ambiguous causal relationship semi explicit 
relation expressed verb preposition highly ambiguous 
np produced np np inducing np np provoking np anxiety provoking situations np related np np np np np infection complex nominals explicit unambiguous causal relationship 
relation expressed explicitly verbs cause 
np causing np disease causing bacteria np caused np infection caused situations head noun complex nominal construction modi ed adjective usually derived noun levi 
instance thermal stress comes heat stress 
analysis applies type complex nominals 

implicit causality verbs 
caramazza colleagues garvey caramazza caramazza observed sentence fragments readers prefer interpret pronoun referring potential referents despite lack disambiguating gender information 
pronoun preferentially interpreted referring burglar preferentially interpreted referring policeman 
burglar policeman sorry 
actor policeman brave 
caramazza argued preferences due property implicit causality belongs verbs 
verbs including confess said impute implicit causality agent meaning burglar instigator events described sentence explanation cause events concerned character 
contrast verbs admire said impute implicit causality patient sentence policeman causes admiration event occur 
answer question actor admire policeman concerned policeman 
importantly implicit causality favors participants referent pronoun 
discourse structure 
discourse psychologists developed tested models predict inferences generated line comprehension 
reading novel example classes knowledge inferences potentially generated goals plans character traits characters knowledge beliefs character emotions causes events consequences events actions spatial relationships entities consider sentences dragon dragging girl 
hero came fought dragon graesser 
graesser mills classes inferences encoded second sentence read superordinate goal motive 
hero wanted rescue girl 
superordinate goal action 
hero threw spear 
causal antecedent 
girl frightened 
causal consequence 
hero married girl 
static property 
dragon scales
