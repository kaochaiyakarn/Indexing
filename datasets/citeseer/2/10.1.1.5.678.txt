order provide understanding combined behavior affects network throughput examine different phenomena 
medium access control ad hoc wireless networks nature broadcast medium 
means transmission node simultaneously propagates nodes range 
downside property node sending packets neighbors packets affect node range 
furthermore nodes transmit simultaneously transmissions overlap garbled medium causing receiver unable successfully receive packet 
result single transmission occur time range intended receiver 
medium access control mac protocol responsible providing channel access arbitration ensuring nodes defer sending avoid interfering transmission progress 
mac protocol uses mechanisms deferral

hops vs throughput trade approach increasing throughput configure nodes network operate highest transmission speed 
ensure network operate maximum combined simultaneous rate 
approach may run problems inherent trade transmission rate effective transmission range see 
multi hop ad hoc networks packets frequently traverse hops travel source destination 
slow links high effective range distance source destination covered small number hops 
avoid fastest links reduce effective range node

high rate links shorter effective range greater number hops required cover distance smaller number lower rate hops 
indicated graph high rate throughput drops multiple times decrease low rate throughput 
couple interesting observations evident graph 
observation lines intersect 
means certain distances throughput obtained lower speed links higher speed links 
specific example occurs km 
notice throughput obtained mbps path greater mbps path 
occurs mbps path needed traverse hops distance mbps path consists single hop 
shows traversing high speed links achieve highest throughput cases 
interesting observation approximately km speeds plateau 
due spatial reuse 
path longer multiple transmissions take place simultaneously path 
allows throughput reach steady state additional distance cause significant decrease throughput 
important notice distance throughput links increases link speed increases
