key words privacy data table epistemic logic 
rapid development computer communication technology easier store massive amounts data central location spread users internet 
data may valuable information sources scientists analysts policy decision makers 
may great danger privacy invasion accessed restriction 
past individuals lacked time resources conduct surveillance required invade individual privacy means disseminate information uncovered privacy violations restricted mainly government press 
development internet technology changed situation radically 
nowadays individual internet user easily spread piece information worldwide seconds 
situation revelation private information unauthorized users intentionally may cause serious invasion human rights 
technical problems addressed privacy protection 
authorization authentication mechanisms prevent illegal access databases large extent responsibility data center ensure users infer privacy information legally received data 
traditionally called inference control problem database security 
logical tools applied inference control problem interested logical model specialized problem called database linkage problem 
roughly speaking problem prevent users know private information individual linking public easy know database data receive legally data center 
preliminary version appeared 
user users refers receiving data having potential privacy individuals individual refers person privacy protected 
protection privacy important restriction access database may render data useless 
main challenge achieve balance privacy protection data availability 
achieve purpose database manager check possible kinds knowledge derived disclosed data respond users queries 
restriction privacy violation knowledge data derive useful users 
checking results database managers may decide refuse user query respond modification data 
modeling user knowledge primary importance privacy protection 
artificial intelligence distributed computing epistemic logic played major role modeling knowledge 
natural adopt framework current purpose 
knowledge knowledge called introspective knowledge concern nested modalities needed current framework syntax semantics slightly simplified 
epistemic logic model provides rigorous definition privacy violation 
direct release data table may cause invasion privacy 
approach simply refuse release data definitely conservative acceptable 
alternative approach modify data released 
common modification method generalize values data cells coarser level precision 
approach appropriately impossible identify private information individual user induce useful general knowledge data 
generalization data values partition domain values levels precision try generalize data finest coarsest level privacy requirement met 
kind operation called level generalization 
hand try merge values data replace single value merged result 
generalized values may nonempty subset domains process called set generalization
