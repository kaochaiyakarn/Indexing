presence cables accommodated specially provisioned place 
addition noise system generate effectively isolated 
rotating hardware hard disks fans noise generating components electromagnetic relays brought single place keeping rest house 
furthermore system physically secured minors checked answering machine message lately 
appropriate power supply ups provisioned constantly maintain power worrying size noise appearance distribution power multiple locations 
furnace acts central hub content communications control eliminate wasteful duplication provide universal access functionality local remote location access control policies effectively backup data importantly exploit synergies allows 
single modern cpu easily handle functions described section 
numerous specialised devices replaced single generalpurpose

naturally important functions entails considerable risks effectively controlled associated policies centralised implemented reasonably secure operating system 
addition programming information stored device centrally backed regular basis 
surprisingly information furnace concept applied replacement stand provision functions supports increases aspects merit originally proposed nomadic computers intelligence size cost power important benefit synergies exploited examine aspect section final element information furnace architecture concerns user interface
