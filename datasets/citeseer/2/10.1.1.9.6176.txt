extracting semantically similar syntactic dependencies attempt identify describe semantic relations embedded syntactic dependencies 
purpose start extracting syntactic dependent words partially analysed text corpora 
order identify syntactic dependencies words apply step process 
select candidate dependencies account basic syntactic rules 
second build clusters semantically similar dependencies 
assume dependencies clustered represent true syntactic relations 
different procedures selection candidate syntactic dependencies clustering similar candidates described subsections 
heuristics select candidate dependencies procedure selecting candidate binary dependencies takes account syntactic information 
corpus tagged part speech tagger 
tagged corpus analysed sequences basic chunks potentialities shallow parser 
parser produces single partial syntactic description sentences analysed sequences related basic chunks np pp vp 
simple heuristics right association order attach basic chunks chunk tends attached chunk immediately right 
consider word heads attached chunks form candidate syntactic dependency 
easily seen syntactic errors may appear attachment heuristics take account long distant dependencies 
heuristics rely poor defined linguistic rules correctness attachments 
reasons attachment errors argued binary dependencies identified elementary heuristics mere hypotheses attachment mere candidates 
describe internal structure candidate dependency words 
syntactic dependency consists words hypothetical grammatical relationship 
represent dependency binary relation instantiated specific grammatical markers particular prepositions subject relations direct object relations arrows represent head complement position respectively word head position word complement position 
binary dependencies denote grammatical relationships head complement 
asymmetric relationships way syntactic properties head inherited composite construction 
semantic terms words head complement interdependent complement fill semantic preferences selections restrictions required head head fill semantic preferences selection restrictions required complement 
argue candidate dependency represents true syntactic relation semantic requirements identified verified 
subsection describes check candidate related words semantically interdependent 
building clusters true dependencies start describing bi directional semantic requirements syntactic positions constituting dependency 
describe syntactic positions compared clustered forming semantic groups 
explain information validate candidate dependencies 
precisely candidate dependency considered true relation internal syntactic positions involved semantic clustering 
evidence identify semantic relationships 
restriction linguistic research syntactic dependency words semantically described simple restriction 
head viewed word imposes semantic constraints selection restrictions complement fill constraints 
complement syntactically semantically dependent head keeps high degree syntactic semantic autonomy 
linguistic research assumes errors caused restrictive attachment heuristic words missing dictionary words incorrectly tagged sorts parser limitations words related syntactic dependency mutually restricted semantic constraints 
call process mutual restriction related words restriction 
restriction fact word syntactic dependency imposes semantic restrictions matches semantic requirements 
instance consider expression fase da ao phase evolution occurs corpus assume candidate syntactic dependence de fase ao extracted expression semantically formed conditions verified word ao evolution fills selections restrictions imposed head word fase phase fills selection restrictions imposed complement 
conditions address problem identifying selection restrictions 
purpose aim identifying syntactic positions requiring similar selection restrictions words appearing similar syntactic positions

ideas assume different syntactic positions semantically similar impose selection restrictions require similar sets words word distribution
