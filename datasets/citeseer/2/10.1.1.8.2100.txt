architecture section explains architecture integrating metadata gis build digital 
architecture enhances retrieval geographic information exploiting functionality systems communicating information systems shown 
xml xml prep metadata architecture gis data gis 
non spatial cvs prepared xml 
gis datasets processed prep 
location cvs prepared xml 
place id attribute added gis datasets 
xml cv files loaded metadata 
user selected locations passed metadata 
metadata asks gis compute synonyms 
metadata passes documents locations gis display vocabulary extraction requirement integrating metadata gis extracting controlled vocabularies place names gis datasets 
geographical places naturally hierarchical spatial containment 
larger places states national forests contain smaller places counties ranger districts respectively 
gis datasets hierarchy represented implicitly fact spatial footprints contained 
example polygon representing state oregon geometrically contains polygons represent counties oregon 
process called prep implements vocabulary extraction gis datasets generating hierarchical controlled vocabularies place names expressed xml shown steps 
controlled vocabularies loaded non spatial vocabularies sources metadata 
implementing prep encountered number problems 
gis datasets usually separated layers called themes similar feature type 
example forest service ranger districts contained layer national forests contained separate layer 
separation layers prep generate complete hierarchy context single layer 
prep needs know layers correspond levels hierarchy 
datasets available easily automate process 
process layer proper hierarchical order 
nature geographic footprints presents significant obstacle vocabulary extraction 
person imagine layer consisting precise disjoint polygons political county boundaries 
geographic places represented simple polygon 
example national forest may consist non contiguous regions varying shapes sizes resulting complex geographic footprint 
polygons mapped conceptual place name name national forest 
prep implements mapping generating conceptual place identifier adding identifier new attribute polygon 
place identifier attribute added original gis dataset shown step included xml hierarchy loaded metadata 
place identifier generated prep disambiguate place names 
example state oregon contains places officially named salmon creek 
simple keyword search salmon creek yield irrelevant documents 
place identifier gis metadata allows user precisely select location interest map controlled vocabulary 
significant problem arises various footprints generated different times different instruments different purposes quite different precision accuracy 
complex imprecise footprints calculating spatial containment non trivial 
example footprint ranger district may slightly extend footprint national forest ranger dis administrative jurisdiction contained national forest 
prep uses heuristics handle calculations occasionally requires user interaction 
representing places terms metadata supports unofficial place names places commonly referred official geographic footprint 
searching unofficial places names defined necessary feature digital 
example people state washington know pass people take difficulty 
pass official geographic footprint may appear maps 
representing pass term metadata user may document retrieval may may appear gis dataset 
furthermore unofficial place footprint easily assign place identifier official places include place name controlled vocabulary metadata 
place selection primary user task selecting places gis communicating selections metadata associate document specify search 
place selection may simple pointing region map clicking mouse select polygon 
advantage gis ability advanced spatial analysis 
example user may issue query find counties geographic area acres 
gis answer query automatically selecting regions active dataset satisfy specified query 
addition maps user may choose types gis data assist finding relevant regions dataset annual precipitation find counties receive inches rain year 
gis answer query intersecting qualifying regions annual rainfall dataset map counties 
query combined previous example find counties area acres receive inches rain annually 
gis functionality select desired place place names sent metadata 
selecting place gis equivalent selecting corresponding place name metadata hierarchy 
selected place may metadata function document search metadata attachment 
users flexibility metadata gis combination systems selecting places 
terms users metadata easily mix geographic terms place names non geographic terms 
current implementation adds new button popular gis application produced 
user may functionality analyze geographic datasets 
point process user may select locations selection mechanisms click button send selections metadata 
integrated architecture easily extended gis applications transforming gis application powerful tool geographic information retrieval 
synonym discovery metadata uses synonyms query expansion document retrieval 
non geographic controlled vocabularies wildlife species climate terms synonymous terms represented explicitly metadata 
geographic controlled vocabularies place names metadata uses gis find synonyms 
explicitly represent synonymous places metadata chose reasons 
large number synonyms exist places 
place location vocabulary may considered synonym places location vocabularies 
example land county lower willamette river basin 
land state oregon belongs county belongs watershed may part ranger district resulting large number possible synonyms 
second significant reason ambiguous semantics spatial synonymy 
spatial footprints different places exactly coincide places defined synonyms 
rarely occurs real geography 
county lower willamette river basin geographic place spatial footprints coincide 
points county lower willamette river basin vice versa 
type situation difficult explicitly represent spatial synonyms related terms metadata 
spatial synonyms determined gis computing percentage overlap polygons user specified threshold 
gis computes synonyms representing explicitly metadata user may adjust threshold achieve desired results 
addition percentage overlap user may wish include gis computations adjacency proximity discovering synonyms 
computations performed default set datasets specific datasets chosen user 
shows example synonym discovery gis 
user selects lower willamette river watershed controlled vocabulary 
metadata sends selection gis 
established threshold gis determines place vocabularies political regions overlap selected region 
example gis determines lower willamette river basin spatial synonym county returns place metadata 
addition finding synonyms places selected metadata synonym discovery may combined place selection 
user selects area map gis compute spatial synonyms send corresponding places selected place synonyms metadata processing 
document display metadata north river lower willamette river river political washington oregon county columbia county synonym discovery natural resource documents attached place names useful display documents map 
document part query result metadata send appropriate place name gis 
gis display documents appropriate map 
example consider document hazardous tree removal county 
user searched documents tree removal state oregon 
metadata show document context hierarchy notify gis document attached county 
gis locate polygon corresponding county display icon representing document near polygon 
gis related geographic information retrieval gir focuses document retrieval geographic documents 
document uniquely classified georeferenced non 
georeferenced documents digital map contain explicit geography form spatial footprint coordinate polygon 
documents environmental impact statement contain explicit spatial footprint contain implicit geography form textual place names 
non documents scientific report describing feeding process spotted owls related implicitly explicitly geographic location 
type document considered gir system 
gir systems spatial queries document retrieval 
spatial queries execute geographic footprints georeferenced documents easily retrieved 
document considered spatial search system associate footprint document point georeferenced 
automatically associating footprints documents non trivial 
documents contain place names place names ambiguous 
le document president united states may mistakenly associated town george state washington real town 
similarly city portland exists oregon maine 
related problem alternate informal names places 
example older informal document may refer boston massachusetts bean town portland oregon stump town 
metadata searches documents context term hierarchy context spatial footprints documents 
architecture uses gis execute spatial queries extract vocabularies place names discover spatial synonyms document retrieval occurs metadata require documents associated spatial footprints 
adept digital library architecture provides support geographic information retrieval search buckets 
search bucket metadata category defined search semantics 
collections may provide metadata items documents various buckets 
example geographic location bucket contains coordinates describing document spatial footprint supports spatial search operators contains overlaps contained 
assigned term bucket contains subject related terms controlled vocabularies supports text search operators contains words contains words contains phrase 
adept architecture searches multiple heterogeneous collections specifying queries various bucket search operators 
treating place names terms controlled vocabularies metadata uses single unified search operation exploits hierarchical relationships synonyms 
synonyms discovered gis handled uniformly synonyms explicitly represented metadata 
gir research relies ontologies facilitate information retrieval 
spirit attempts address proximity relationships alternate informal place names developing geographical ontology models vocabulary spatial structure places 
oasis represents places explicit objects ontology specific attributes latitude longitude standard name relationships meets overlap partof place objects 
relationships explicitly represent query spatial relationships places 
building explicit ontology metadata focuses faithfully representing controlled vocabularies spatial non spatial commonly application domain 
hierarchy place names metadata similar partof relationship metadata relies gis discover spatial synonyms representing relationships meets overlap explicitly 
similar spirit proposes similar architecture 
authors argue convincingly gir systems support kinds description keyword spatial kinds search assume sides system providing search capability set documents 
recommend user interface available gir system include different user interfaces components correspond distinct ways representing organizing information 
architecture follows philosophy separate interface metadata standard gis system 
key differences compared system explicitly accommodates non documents gis component standard gis system browse various kinds maps layers select locations explicitly search documents document system metadata spatial metaphor display non spatial keywords provide hierarchical display terms explicit domain controlled vocabularies describe places able easily combine place names non spatial terms description search documents metadata 
portal map digital library architecture georeferenced resources 
metadata portal provides map interface classification interface support non documents 
authors emphasize synchronization interfaces documents selected interface automatically selected interface 
differs portal primary purpose map interface 
metadata map interface gis specify searches documents 
intended search geographic places place names combined search terms metadata displaying documents search results 
implemented prototype architecture including vocabulary extraction place selection 
initial user feedback positive testing continue additional users 
include implementation synonym discovery document display 
consider georeferenced documents associated unnamed places coordinate 
documents may handled spatial synonyms spatial searches gis 
continuing metadata 
includes implementing templates way users pre select certain terms hierarchy search metadata attachment 
example works national forest may define template automatically select national forest douglas fir trees 
begun detailed comparison metadata searches trails vector space searches keyword vectors 
detailed comparison help better evaluate effectiveness metadata 
combining rich vocabulary document retrieval system traditional gis tools enable users natural resource management effectively precisely retrieve geographic non geographic information 
combining vocabularies place names controlled vocabularies allows provide simple unified mechanism creating searching metadata 
architecture lets users easily specify searches involving spatial non spatial search terms 
architecture provides clean separation components metadata unaware spatial footprints gis unaware documents 
architecture simply provides gis deliver place names metadata user request
