mouse ether works algorithm mouse ether works computing pointer locations device independent coordinate system reflects physical size location screen addressing scenario allows representing gaps screens addressing scenario 
summarizes simple algorithm 
mouse ether launched reads mouse pointer current coordinates translates device independent real valued ether coordinates stores left dashed arrows 
ether coordinate pointer ex ey computed pointer onscreen coordinates cx cy times screen pixel size plus location top left corner screen 
init cx cy screen frame screen cx cy mouse ether processing mouse move mouse ether intercepts mouse move events mouse effectively talks mouse ether operating system 
mouse ether adds intercepted mouse moves internal mouse pointer coordinates stores new position thick arrow 
mouse motion visible new position translated back screen coordinates pointer displayed location right dashed arrows 
back translation done going array screens screen testing new mouse coordinate lies screen boundaries 
ether coordinates mouse transformed screen coordinate system inverse transformation 
screen matches pointer screen mouse ether hides pointer 
allowing travel screen space diagonally traveling mouse pointer correct location scenario mouse ether algorithm mouse pointer travel screen space 
pointer disappears leaving screen reappear user moved mouse far reach screen 
default travel time screen screen mouse ether configured higher mouse speed screen 
prevent mouse pointer getting lost space mouse ether limits screen travel purpose transit 
mouse ether allows entering screen space angles certain tolerance aim screen unit 
screen mouse motion wards open space constrained closest direction aiming screen 
screen space accessible time forms subset convex hull screens translucent light areas dashed outlines 
constraining space allows users force hidden pointer reappear mouse 
user stops mouse screen mouse ether warps pointer closest onscreen location 
compensating spear fishing effects screen travel solves class problems related pointer behavior 
non convex display spaces target acquisitions attempts cross inner display border get blocked 
shows selection example cases 
allowing mouse pointer temporarily move screen mouse ether eliminates barriers allows targets located acquired direct path 
user perspective system perspective mouse ether target target low dpi start start blocked dpi start blocked high dpi target target target low dpi start start dpi start high dpi target mouse ether mouse pointer get blocked screen borders way
