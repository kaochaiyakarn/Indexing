discussion developing applications time forced expand reduce modify flip zooming technique 
modifications exposed number preconceptions focus context techniques general 
preconceptions seen negative fact cases probably sensible approach 
case alternative methods variations may advantageous required technique feasible cases preconceptions limits usability technique 
focus focus foci 
seemingly trivial observation name focus context visualization focus plural form foci 
applications natural limitation users object time 
activities require users directly compare objects switch different objects rapidly 
long focus context visualization technique requires explicit user input change focus different parts visualization exists small interaction overhead cost making difficult switch activities 
way remove mitigate overhead allow foci time easy switch different foci 
original form flip zooming allow users foci parallel 
multiple foci enabled digital variants viewer order support comparison documents 
application multiple foci introduced visualized simultaneously represented different activities user switching performing 
view exemplifies variant having multiple foci useful user needs gain detail places visualization continuous information map 
historical interest noted idea polyfocal visualization introduced information visualization techniques developed computers 
focus vs center attention 
traditionally focus context techniques change focus user selected new point interest form particular position display distinguishable object 
user performing activity task involving applications people objects outside computer focus visualization match center user attention focus selected user visualization focus close describing user interest focus interaction designers acknowledge order create usable technology 
case traditional focus context techniques developed desktop computer difference focus visualization user center attention great problem pc usually occupies users complete attention 
designing mobile users setting environment acknowledged understanding distinction important 
working applications tried design distinction mind 
consequences line reasoning different information types view applications focus helping user simple task 
looking related spence apperley designed bifocal display information visualization technique dealing number different kinds information simultaneously 
context differentiable context 
hierarchical visualization distinction local global context possibility levels trivial pieces information closely related depending hierarchy located 
create different presentations context objects depending far focus located

activity hand require user able manipulate context 
focus context techniques assumption user needs overview detail information 
activities true necessarily time 
focus required complete task context part context 
example working pages book just reading page requires focus 
see pages text consists pages distributed chapters context needed see page chapter requires context chapter 
able distinguish manipulate different parts context change appearance including visible define differentiable context 
due modularity hierarchical flip zooming visualizations hierarchical image browser digital variants browser automatically supports differentiable context 
selecting full focus view outermost middle inner visualization user effectively zoom removing global context remove middle context maintaining local global context remove local context 
granularity user manipulate context type interaction equal depth hierarchy 
looking related sarkar brown function determine context objects placed giving examples cartesian polar geometric transformations introducing variants functions parameters user control techniques extended allow user modify context fashion similar dynamic queries 
difficult see user proper feedback visualizations new visual elements boundaries differentiate different parts context 
giving user form control degree interest doi function enable user defined context presentation beneficial context easily differentiable :10.1.1.20.2244
multiple views context 
similar point focus word context singular form focus context visualizations 
intuitive context perceived near 
near depends highly viewer point view 
changing point view may radically change perception context focus changing focus visualization 
translated focus context visualizations changing point view possibility easily change context presentation focus context maintaining focus 
zoom browser west browser multiple ways presenting focus context order provide user ways accessing information visualized 
partly user assumed need different ways solve task partly information individual tile clearly 
applications multiple context reason 
enables user rapidly switch different activities represented selected object application natural context 
viewed fashion described application personal role manager approach 
focus context technique dynamic queries combination techniques allow multiple views context 
case dynamic queries filter information select different view modes presentation 
homogenous heterogeneous contexts 
information visualizations visualize type information different types information presentation visualizing highest common denominator 
homogenous context possible inherent structure information sort files contact lists alphabetically emails meetings chronologically order create structured presentation 
doing understanding context easier navigating information simpler 
times find different types information common connection email person entry contact list denoting person 
presenting information context creates heterogeneous context 
mentioned section focus limitations application heterogeneous contexts 
doing differ visualization techniques may show different types information merge information presentation treat information belonging general type incorporates types 
case interaction performed manipulating presentation second case objects interacted fashion respond identically 
presenting heterogeneous context manipulating different objects give differ ent results allow task oriented approach information visualization 
application audible information form phone calls introduced part system 
phone call quite different feedback system sounds accompany error messages complement information available visual form channel communication may may supported visually information 
creating system additional perceptual modes hearing possibilities added constitute focus context
