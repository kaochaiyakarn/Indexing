issue rotation shuffling documents considered briefly 
tabletop interfaces deal cartesian coordinate systems 
knowledge interface previously proposed handle challenges orient organize shared documents polar coordinate system interface sits people looking different angles 
general sense complements existing systems described 
previous provides solutions problems users view manage annotate interact individual documents table cartesian coordinate system explores issues orientation visual layout automatic scaling relocation individual subgroup entire tabletop viewing area polar coordinate system

tabletop orientation user position determination circular interface supports multiple people working documents tabletop surface 
order able fully support individual user viewing preferences group shared viewing needs developed general user interface functions entire tabletop interface surface freely rotated direction

document orientation traditional rectangular interfaces typically assume users viewing interface roughly direction angle 
contrast interest support face toface collaborations interface situated participants consider issues rotation entire interface 
need led develop novel visualization interaction schemes order facilitate convenient re orientation documents interface surface ease passing documents table surface

document size previous section saw computer facilitate layout orientation documents 
methods helping user manage size images 
reasons varying size documents including possible stretch real documents sheet zoom feature important benefit augmented table 
image size emphasize certain pictures discussion better inspection 
maximum resolution video projector project table poor far human eye resolution 
application display pictures system loses content picture 
implemented focus context visualization techniques fisheye views circular tabletop interface order improve user interaction experience 
techniques observation focus context conversation quite different different uses system user working separately shares documents users 
user showing documents users 
cases designed different fisheye technique central focus central black hole visualizations modify size document distance middle table 
shown central focus provides unique focus middle table users share personal areas individual users border table documents small 
central focus effect zoomed image center normal size picture zoomed image periphery 
central black hole illustrated exactly opposite border table handles normal size documents documents smaller closer center table 
central focus suited situation user wants show documents users 
externally looks traditional fisheye technique context smoothly divided different areas facing user table 
second technique user uses periphery table close order manage documents 
pushes document middle table document smaller uses space 
seen figures central black hole approach overlapping documents normal approach 
central black hole effect density pictures previous figures 
users exchange document central focus central black hole transaction zone 
user gives picture pushing center interface takes pulling area 
central focus allows potentially interested users visualize picture detail deciding take 
contrast central black hole allows user push pictures middle filling space 
described graphical compressed buffer picture exchange 
system support methods exchanging pictures people physical photographs tabletop 
fisheye deformation shows easier understand deformed space comes perspective effect 
decided add spider web grid background reflect distortion 
improvement significant improvement corresponding perspective effect previous fisheye deformation systems 
explanation position fisheye center obvious users circular interface documents point center 
traditional interfaces understanding fisheye deformation difficult choice deformation center arbitrary point uniform space 
central point polar space seams stronger cue position mouse center screen typically center deformation 

hierarchy visualization 
hierarchy presentation fisheye deformations described allow users manage documents screen visualizations described far cluttered eventually unusable number documents large 
scale system handle large numbers documents provide support hierarchical representation data 
particular allow users form groups data contain individual documents groups created users 
representation similar example standard file folder system widely operating systems graphical interfaces 
people system time need approach folders opened time 
shows example hierarchical layout 
part pdh system people browse portraits people appear database 
hierarchy organization people portraits pdh tabletop display menus users sitting apart table 
visualization technique compromise need show tree structure documents desire user control location documents table 
example user left browsing content node people family direct group named people contains group named family contains group named direct contains pictures 
user bottom browsing branch hierarchy people merl 
hierarchy layout leaf hierarchy image person portrait text string showing name person 
non leaf nodes hierarchy root titled people center represented mosaic images node children string title 
nodes open people direct closed world grenoble 
mosaic indicates nodes children individual documents represented single image groups represented mosaic contain mosaics 
default position root center table re located users 
putting node focus middle opening children direction table border produces layout comparable hyperbolic browser 
conjunction central black hole view layouts closely resemble hyperbolic browser 
hyperbolic browser automatically lays nodes approach allows user control groups leaves positioned 
allow users bookmark restore save load alternative hierarchical layouts 
believe users prefer better remember able effective layouts help design 
describing interactions possible quickly produce user layout list actions manipulation hierarchy click leaf non leaf node selects 
free stroke lasso selection different mode select multiple leaves node time 
drag drop leave non leaf node node move dragged element hierarchy 
contextual menu proposes create new node destroy existing 

interaction animation manage hierarchy provide features create destroy move open close group leaf 
key problem display children appear user opens node 
system provides features control layout hierarchical data flower animation fan drag drop flower animation illustrated played user continuously maintains input device button pressed node long click 
opening node system displays node children uniformly node opened merl moves farther farther node 
animation stops user ends long click children far apart separated pre set gap 
shows examples system 
viewing portraits middle layout sufficient reading text third step right preferable 
chose decrease size node opened children move give direct feedback manipulated object 
user performs long click action opened node system closes node playing animation reverse order 
right left 
fan drag drop distributing children node bottom right direction mechanism opens closes nodes elegantly help avoid overlap different branches hierarchy 
second mechanism essentially allows user control direction flower animation 
long click open node user drags mouse cursor direction 
distance children opening node equals distance drag drop 
angle depends distance number nodes avoid overlapping 
children node equally distributed side mouse cursor red background highlights angle 
feedback artifact clearly shows metaphor fan inspired name interaction 
illustrates fan drag drop opening node merl bottom right direction 
mechanism user chooses empty area area overlapping acceptable 
goal interaction technique produce layout comparable hyperbolic browser static configurable user 
face face collaboration requires ability focus possibility support collaborative manipulations exchange repartition data 

described new hci mechanisms support collaborative interaction circular interface 
approaches designed principles 
give users full capability relocate re orient scale layout documents circular interface 
second provide automatic methods user requires layout cartesian system user needs minimize overlapping crowding documents 
third support users focus group meeting context group collaboration table 
developed new layout mechanism polar coordinate system 
fisheye view deformations supports different type user activity 
interaction technique support user driven construction layout hierarchy interface 
plan explore component polar coordinate system dimension control deformation 
example default size images front user larger ones
