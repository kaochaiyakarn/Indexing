hierarchical faceted metadata site search interfaces jennifer english marti hearst sinha kirsten swearingen ka ping yee group user interface research university california berkeley berkeley ca hearst sinha ping sims berkeley edu pressing usability issues design large web sites organization search results 
previous study moderate sized web site indicated users understood preferred dynamically organized faceted metadata standard search 
examining scale approach large collections difficult hierarchical faceted metadata manner appealing understandable general users 
iteratively designed tested interfaces address design challenges version receiving enthusiastic responses ongoing usability studies 
keywords search user interfaces iterative design www general web search steadily improving studies show search primary usability problem web site design 
examining faceted metadata tie search results information architecture web site 
term faceted metadata mean orthogonal descriptors metadata system 
example different facets associated architecture include materials concrete brick wood styles baroque ming view types interior view exterior view people architects artists developers 
study done create metadata little done explicitly search user interfaces doing idea 
design goals metadata create navigation structure web site organize search results suggest query previews steps user take search session 
interface allow users hyperlinks addition keyword search flexibly explore collection contents different dimensions simultaneously 
interface allow easy flow refining broadening query support directed undirected exploration 
prelude designing interface conducted small exploratory study commercial recipe interface offering search options standard search form search form faceted metadata browsing interface faceted metadata dynamic query previews 
results suggest tasks approaches superior standard search form linear results listing 
suggest choice search centric browse centric interface users recognize utility switching interface best supports current task 
study results indicated utility explicit metadata collection moderate size items metadata choices metadata organized flat non hierarchical facets 
question remains approach scale larger collections applying iterative design principles problem incorporate hierarchical faceted metadata query previews create intuitive accessible search interface 
software allow direct contrasts different interface features 
software collection faceted metadata available initial test collection consists images architecture slide library 
slide approximately items metadata assigned metadata hierarchy contains facets metadata terms 
interface design iterated design interface times 
august examined versions control search interface 
results revealed interest metadata approach features succeeded failed preliminary interfaces elicited generally poor scores ease preference measures 
experimental interfaces called matrix view generated somewhat enthusiastic responses 
informed study significant changes matrix view incorporated results study 
highlight important features interface 
additional important features user selects image thumbnail full image shown hyperlinks associated metadata 
example click site search interface query previews hierarchical faceted metadata images intellectual property considerations 
facets selected locations structure types results grouped third facet view types 
previews lefthand side updated constraints added removed 
clicking group heading city details refines query category 
boxes top display current query clicking western europe relaxes location constraint button removes location facet query 
images sorted important metadata types architect location building name feature available view 
ing thumbnail labeled cannes reveals potentially surprising fact metadata category called roof selected form new query acting expansion opposed refinement feature 
keyword queries usually match category terms results shown list hits contextualized location facet hierarchy 
intermediate pages handle large result sets result keyword searches selecting category hyperlinks 
example images associated architects collection clicking architects link refining facets brings style listing selecting category wright listing returns main view showing designs wright 
innovation show intermediate page results form large 
additionally intermediate pages vary presentation depending number items categories arranged simple column listing categories shown sections columns categories arranged sections columns section hyperlinked index top 
usability studies described reveal users find intermediate pages intuitive 
usability study currently december running new studies architects response participants highly enthusiastic 
participants assigning average point scale nearly measure including likelihood ease usefulness design exploring collection finding particular image seeing relationships 
participants expressed strong desire access interface immediately 
especially significant users reluctant switch simple search form results listings complex innovative interfaces 
suggests hyperlinked faceted metadata viable alternative keyword queries web site search
