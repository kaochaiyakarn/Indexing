distinguishing fraud prevention fraud detection 
fraud prevention describes measures fraud occurring place 
include elaborate designs fluorescent fibres drawings watermarks metal strips pins internet security systems credit card transactions sim cards mobile phones passwords computer systems telephone bank accounts 
course methods perfect general compromise struck expense inconvenience example customer hand effectiveness 
contrast fraud detection involves identifying fraud quickly possible 
fraud detection comes play fraud prevention failed 
practice course fraud detection continuously typically unaware fraud prevention failed 
try prevent credit card fraud guarding cards card details stolen need able detect soon possible fraud 
fraud detection continuously evolving discipline 
known detection method place criminals adapt strategies try 
course new criminals constantly entering field 
aware fraud detection methods successful past adopt strategies lead identifiable 
means earlier detection tools need applied latest developments 
development new fraud detection methods difficult fact exchange ideas fraud detection severely limited 
sense describe fraud detection techniques great detail public domain gives criminals information require order evade detection 
data sets available results censored making difficult assess example leonard 
fraud detection problems involve huge data sets constantly evolving 
example credit card carries approximately transactions year uk hand royal bank scotland largest credit card merchant acquiring business europe carries transactions year carries calls weekday cortes pregibon 
processing search fraudulent transactions calls requires mere novelty statistical model needs fast efficient algorithms data mining techniques relevant 
numbers indicate potential value fraud detection transactions fraudulent losing just loses 
statistical tools fraud detection varied data different applications diverse size type common themes 
tools essentially comparing observed data expected values expected values derived various ways depending context 
may single numerical summaries aspect behaviour simple graphical summaries anomaly readily apparent complex multivariate behaviour profiles 
behaviour profiles may past behaviour system studied example way bank account previously extrapolation similar systems 
things complicated fact domains trading stock market actor may behave fraudulent manner time times 
statistical fraud detection methods may supervised unsupervised 
supervised methods samples fraudulent non fraudulent records construct models allow assign new observations classes 
course requires confident true classes original data build models 
requires examples classes 
furthermore detect type previously occurred 
contrast unsupervised methods simply seek accounts customers dissimilar norm 
examined closely 
outliers basic form non standard observation 
tools checking data quality detection accidental errors different problem detection deliberately falsified data data accurately describe fraudulent pattern 
leads note fundamental point seldom certain statistical analysis fraud 
analysis regarded alerting fact observation anomalous fraudulent investigated detail 
think objective statistical analysis return suspicion score regard higher score suspicious lower 
higher score unusual observation previously fraudulent values fact different ways fraud different scenarios occur means different ways computing suspicion scores 
suspicion scores computed record database customer bank account credit card owner mobile phone desktop computer updated time progresses 
rank ordered investigative attention focussed highest scores exhibit sudden increase 
issues cost enter expensive undertake detailed investigation records concentrates investigation thought fraudulent 
difficulties fraud detection typically legitimate records fraudulent 
detection method correctly identifies legitimate records legitimate fraudulent records fraudulent regarded highly effective system 
records fraudulent average system flags fraudulent fact 
particular means identify requires detailed examination possibly considerable cost 
leads general point fraud reduced low level likes virtue corresponding level effort cost 
practice compromise reached commercial compromise cost detecting fraud savings detecting 
issues complicated example adverse publicity accompanying fraud detection 
business level revealing bank significant target fraud detected little inspire confidence personal level action implies innocent customer may suspected fraud obviously detrimental customer relations

traditional statistical classification methods hand mclachlan linear discriminant analysis logistic discrimination proved effective tools applications powerful tools ripley hand webb especially neural networks extensively applied 
rule methods supervised learning algorithms produce classifiers rules form certain conditions consequent 
examples algorithms include bayes clark niblett foil quinlan ripper cohen 
tree algorithms cart quinlan produce classifiers similar form 
combinations algorithms combined meta learning algorithms improve prediction fraud detection chan 
major considerations building supervised tool fraud detection include uneven class sizes different costs different types misclassification 
take consideration costs investigating observations benefits identifying fraud 
class membership uncertain 
example credit transactions may labelled incorrectly fraudulent transaction may remain unobserved labelled legitimate extent may remain unknown legitimate transaction may fraudulent 
addressed misclassification training samples example context fraud detection far aware 
issues discussed chan stolfo provost fawcett 
link analysis relates known fraudsters individuals record linkage social network methods wasserman faust
