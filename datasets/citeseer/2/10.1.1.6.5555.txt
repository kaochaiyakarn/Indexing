briefly fuller discussion see 
researchers agree divide need models problem models multiple overlapping conflicting duplicated minds conflict resolution mechanisms generate winning actions collection 

researchers re reasons software re general easy promised complex installation incompatibility libraries versions languages operating systems 
suggested look successful model re people documents programs remote web servers 
suggest model agent minds agent worlds stay remote server installed 

need total language platform independence researchers concentrate ai networks 

easier virtual agents impossible robotic agents field internet tele robotics demonstrates 
world wide mind proposed scheme address issues called world wide mind 
scheme proposed researchers construct agent minds worlds servers internet 
types servers basic scheme types server 
world body server 
server queried current state world detected body sent actions body perform world 

mind server behavior producing system capable suggesting action particular input state mind server mind server calls mind servers 
example 
action selection mind server resolves competition multiple mind servers 
mind server suggests action execute 
server queries produces winning action outside world server looks just mind server producing types societies allowing mind servers call incrementally build complex hierarchies networks societies mind 
call collection mind server acting society 
society built stages 
stage single mind server serves interface society send state receive back action 

mind server calls mind servers 
run society talk mind server 

mind server multiple mind servers 
run society talk mind server 
types users 
non technical client user essentially user internet 
basically client user run people minds people worlds 
needing technical ability client able 
pick mind server run world 
apparently simple choice may product lot hard picking suitable servers 
suggested client results url 
new server created link existing servers particular arguments 

non technical client may able construct society 
instance select combination remote mind servers remote server resolve competition world server run society 
precise pick mind server pass list mind servers startup argument just pick world run mind server 
client results 
new server created link existing servers particular arguments 

technically proficient server author user internet ability 
need understand construct server understanding ai necessarily profound 
example 
write wrapper existing working mind server write new mind server 
simple type wrapper provide actions just selectively call servers input mind server mind server 

ai proficient server author try writing mind server attempts provide actions input take action old server 
author may need little understanding existing mind server works 
overriding area input space doesn doesn perform better may try overriding different area 

advanced level ai researchers write servers scratch 
envisaged ai researchers techniques 
low bandwidth communication mind servers come diverse sources written different ai methodologies different languages understand goals limit information usefully communicate 
central question information server need mind servers resolve competition 
example just gets simple list suggested actions little just pick popular 
sophisticated action selection mind server needs provide information 
consider schemes competition resolved numeric weights symbolic reasoning 
example mind server tells server action wants take plus weight expressing willing pay win competition 
define weights 
value defines action pursuit mind server goal mind server build table showing expected value action state 

value defines bad mind server lose competition 
depends action taken loses 
mind server may maintain table defining bad lose state 
may judge badness specific action quantity 
usage comes 
differences see 
higher bandwidth communications numeric weights difficult impose structure inside mind server 
implementation sub symbolic society mind symbolic 
definition state action 
far avoided question exact data structure passed back forth state action 
definition different different domains 
scheme proposes allow different definitions exist 
server explain format state action generate expect time just involve linking server definition 
name world wide mind name world wide mind number points 
mind stays server mind literally decentralised world parts mind different remote servers 

parts mind separate important thing separation mind world separation different parts mind maintained different authors

system necessarily interested learning interacting current web users 
ai imagine scheme inevitable ai days isolated experiments numbered 
detailed discussion see 
briefly addresses issues 
duplication effort sharing difficult researchers tend build agent minds worlds scratch duplicating done 
number attempts re agent minds worlds model re requires installation particular programming language 
propose language independent model remote re 
probably closest previous philosophy 

unused agents worlds having invented robotic agent testbed experiments done 
example fact people put ai mind online eliza type chat program 
people talked soon ceased interact world 
brief finite interaction world seen people norm autonomous agents research 
field acceptable direct access major systems discussion 
action selection researchers seen tyrrell world running example 
robotics researchers seen cog move movie 
due incompatibilities software expense hardware accept experiment see things read papers 

making ai science rd party experimentation building agent world means new algorithms tested world previous algorithms 
prove agent architecture better important issue 
points essentially uses architectures convinced tests 
branch ai existence objective tests argued tends provide major impetus research 
reasons popularity rule games ai robotic soccer 
suggests setting website repository standard tests adaptive behavior 
goes standard test worlds need installed run remotely 
goes support testing 
emphasis rd party experimentation algorithms subjected constant examination populations testers vested interest outcome 
rd parties test servers environments authors thought combine servers authors write 
servers get thorough testing authors 

minds complex fully understood definitely evolutionary criticism advanced artificial minds may complex understood 
system propose vast network servers calling servers individual link network sense person set need system grasped individual 
objections model discussion possible objections see 
mention points 
models broken links brain damage need understood models fault tolerant artificial minds 
explicitly addressed issue brain damage large society mind 
reader wondered point model ai survive brain damage 
point model ai survive broken links 

premature symbolic level attempt define mind network protocols 
probably true 
researchers long debated symbolic ai knowledge sharing protocols arguing premature define protocols 
debate continued agents community debate agent communication languages extent xml 
agreement weak may endeavour premature 
example attempts implement society mind internet insist symbolic model limited progress 
argue premature start defining mind network protocols sub symbolic level 

network 
possibly true 
change 

agents researchers done 
apparently 
major differences agents approach 
agents researchers imagine agents installed 
disagree 
agents servers 

agents localised installed mind body 
multiple remote minds servers body 
consider distributed ai dai split camps 
distributed problem solving dps minds cooperating solve problem body 

multi agent systems mas minds different bodies 
mind body actors coordination multiple actors 
field agents come mean 
clear servers agents 
multiple minds solving multiple problems body 
closer adaptive behavior interest multi goal creatures goals may simply conflict 
previous alife mas approach society agents distributed network single agent mind 

short agents researchers simply aren trying solve problem divide ai link multiple laboratories addressed start 
implementation define way implementing idea today network 
suggest standard client server model short limited length transactions 
server responds short query response limited time 
server know receive query 
client software driving single top level mind world implements program 
server connect server send new run command receive unique run id 
repeat 
connect world send id query state get state 
connect mind send id send state get action 
connect world send id send action get new state 
connect mind send id tell new state receive confirm 
server connect server send id send run receive confirm unique run id server may simultaneously involved runs clients 
lay client algorithm example implement time outs 
may implement general purpose algorithm server queries 
similarly server may implement algorithm likes provided responds set queries expected may client server 
definition really comes just definition possible queries responses servers 
detailed list queries see 
technology implement queries 
suggest overriding objective server authors required know little possible get servers network 
server authors interested ai necessarily networks

may written network application may want learn 
result proposed basic implementation done cgi 
ai programmer access server cgi ai programmer write program receives stdin writes stdout 
justification see 
format data transmitted 
suggest plain text xml 
need format xml provides extensible format invention new queries won crash old servers
