view treatment shadows step integrating non local lighting phenomena traditional reconstruction techniques 
main difficulty encountered carving past visual hull 
issues may simultaneously contributing problem 
voxel coloring hampered trying find consistent model weaker minimizing error metric model 
second algorithm works better single material multiple materials possibly target materials sufficiently modeled materials 
result consistency threshold set high voxels carved 
better results may possible orientation consistency conjunction multi view stereo techniques 
option better objects results obtained indicate linear combination model need perfectly match target material 
hertzmann seitz believe better results obtained highly textured surfaces voxels surface clearly inconsistent highly textured surfaces 
previous orientation consistency yielded results detail noise 
believe explanation results run higher resolution normal pixel required estimating fewer parameters 
key advantage create full object models opposed single depth map 
principle multiple depth maps created photometric stereo methods merged full object model expect global distortions incurred normal integration errors merging procedure difficult 
additional advantage properly account cast shadows 
general suggests bridging gap photometric techniques orientation consistency multiview techniques voxel coloring promising avenue geometric reconstruction
