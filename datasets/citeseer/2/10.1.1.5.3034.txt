analysis prosodic data phonetic analysis leap data carried semiautomatic style supported various tasx analysis tools 
calculation speech rhythm ramus example information fourth tier described section taken 
length vocalic parts utterances recording calculated standard deviation computed percentage vocalic intervals entire recording 
measurements proved useful description difference speech rhythm languages varieties languages 
results speakers illustrated automatically generated graph see 
similarly analysis speakers pitch range carried semi automatically 
time stamps fifth tier pitch height taken corresponding waves get file measurements pitch range pitch span analysis patterson calculated mean initial mean subsequent mean lows mean final lows 
third area prosodic analysis speech data tonal alignment stressed syllables 
english german differ respect useful feature description non native prosody 
analysis time stamps tone tier provides information occurrence stressed syllables time stamps pitch tier gives pitch maxima time stamps rhythm tier indicates vowel boundaries combined presence pitch height relation vowel boundary calculated 
features important analysis language learn ers speech rate fluency intonation patterns supported tasx analysis tools 
tools freely available scientific community open source software 

despite early stage research tasx approach proved highly efficient reliable 
time consuming task phonetically analysing speech data partially substituted automatic analysis 
transformation process non xml xml annotated data errors human annotations detected 
furthermore due highly structured format tasx converted data complex reseach questions investigated systematic way 
xml aware software tools enabled develop powerful linguistic environment short time 
important tasx annotated data transformed large number different formats 
hopefully lead creation linguistic resources long period time different researches various goals
