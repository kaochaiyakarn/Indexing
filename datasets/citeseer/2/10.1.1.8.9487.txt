corpus approach building semantic lexicons ellen riloff jessica shepherd department computer science university utah salt lake city ut riloff cs utah edu semantic knowledge great asset natural language processing systems usually hand coded application 
semantic information available general purpose knowledge bases wordnet cyc applications require domain specific lexicons represent words categories particular topic 
corpus method build semantic lexicons specific categories 
input system small set seed words category representative text corpus 
output ranked list words associated category 
user reviews top ranked words decides ones entered semantic lexicon 
experiments categories users typically words category minutes build core semantic lexicon 
semantic information helpful aspects natural language understanding including word sense disambiguation selectional restrictions attachment decisions discourse processing 
semantic knowledge add great deal power accuracy natural language processing systems 
semantic information difficult obtain 
cases semantic knowledge encoded manually application 
large scale efforts create broad semantic knowledge bases wordnet miller cyc lenat prakash shepherd 
efforts may useful applications believe fully satisfy need semantic knowledge 
domains characterized sublanguage containing terms jargon specific field 
representing sublanguages single knowledge base nearly impossible 
furthermore domain specific semantic lexicons useful minimizing ambiguity problems 
context restricted domain polysemous words strong preference word sense knowing probable word sense domain strongly constrain ambiguity 
experimenting method building semantic lexicons semiautomatically 
system uses text corpus small set seed words category identify words belong category 
algorithm uses simple statistics bootstrapping mechanism generate ranked list potential category words 
human reviews top words selects best ones dictionary 
approach geared fast semantic lexicon construction handful seed words category representative text corpus build semantic lexicon category just minutes 
section describe statistical bootstrapping algorithm identifying candidate category words ranking 
describe experimental results categories 
discuss experiences additional categories seed word lists summarize results 
generating semantic lexicon observation category members surrounded category members text example conjunctions lions tigers bears lists lions tigers bears appositives white nominal compounds fish 
category members wondered possible collect surrounding contexts statistics identify words belong category 
approach motivated yarowsky word sense disambiguation algorithm yarowsky notion statistical salience system uses somewhat different statistical measures techniques 
small set seed words category 
experimented different numbers seed words surprised find seed words category worked quite 
example seed word lists experiments shown 
energy fuel gas gasoline oil power financial bank banking currency dollar money military army commander soldier troop vehicle airplane car plane truck weapon bomb dynamite gun rifle initial seed word lists input system text corpus initial set seed words category 
ideally text corpus contain category 
approach designed domainspecific text processing text corpus representative sample texts domain categories semantic classes associated domain 
text corpus initial seed word list category algorithm building semantic lexicon follows 
identify sentences text corpus contain seed words 
sentence parser segments sentence simple noun phrases verb phrases prepositional phrases 
purposes need higher level parse structures 

collect small context windows surrounding occurrence seed word head noun corpus 
restricting seed words head nouns ensures seed word main concept noun phrase 
reduces chance finding different word senses seed word multiple noun word senses may problem 
narrow context window consisting words noun word right noun left 
collected nouns assumption true category members nouns 
course may depend target categories 
context windows cut sentence boundaries 
note context window narrower researchers yarowsky 
experimented larger window sizes narrow windows consistently included words related target category 

context windows category compute category score word essentially conditional probability word appears category context 
category score word category defined score freq context windows freq corpus note exactly conditional probability single word occurrence belong context window 
example consider sentence bought ak gun rifle 
word context windows gun rifle just occurrence sentence 
consequently category score word greater 
remove stopwords numbers words corpus frequency 
stopword list containing general nouns pronouns determiners 
stopwords numbers specific category common domains felt safe remove 
remaining nouns sorted category score ranked nouns strongly associated category appear top 

top nouns seed words added seed word list dynamically 
go back step repeat process 
bootstrapping mechanism dynamically grows seed word list iteration produces larger category context 
experiments top nouns added automatically human intervention allows non category words dilute growing seed word list 
inappropriate words impact inappropriate words highly frequent words weaken feedback process 
person verify word belongs target category adding seed word list require human interaction iteration feedback cycle 
decided see technique additional human interaction potential benefits human feedback need investigated 
iterations seed word list typically contains relevant category words 
importantly ranked list contains additional category words especially near top 
number iterations big difference quality ranked list 
new seed words generated dynamically manual review quality ranked list deteriorate rapidly non category words seed words 
experiments iterations usually worked 
output system ranked list nouns final iteration 
seed word list thrown away 
note original seed words known category members new seed words ranked list selected 
user review ranked list identify words true category members 
defines true category member subjective may depend specific application leave exercise person 
typically words near top ranked list highly associated category density category words decreases proceeds list 
user may scan list sufficient number category words long time permits 
words selected user added permanent semantic lexicon appropriate category label 
goal allow user build semantic lexicon categories small set known category members seed words text corpus 
output ranked list potential category words user review create semantic lexicon quickly 
success approach depends quality ranked list especially density category members near top

example dogs members animal category 
subpart member category word refers part member category deserves 
example feathers tails parts animals 
strongly associated category word refers strongly associated members category member category deserves 
example nests strongly associated animals 
weakly associated category word refers associated members category associated types things deserves 
example parks weakly associated animals 
association category word virtually association category deserves 
example tables moons virtually association animals 
unknown word know word means labeled 
important 
words distinct meanings 
example word horse refer animal piece equipment mean fool don horse 
word meaning associated category consider meaning assigning numbers 
example word horse meanings refers animal 
instructions human judges membership example words gun rifle bomb labeled weapons 
practical perspective subparts category members acceptable 
example trigger mentioned context event infer gun 
applications word strongly associated category useful include semantic lexicon 
example words ammunition bullets highly suggestive weapon 
umass muc information extraction system lehnert words ammunition bullets defined weapons mainly purpose selectional restrictions 
human judges estimated took approximately minutes average judge words category

claim understand exactly types categories ones early experiences shed light strengths weaknesses approach 
addition previous categories experimented categories location commercial person 
location category performed seed words city town province 
didn formally evaluate category category words proper nouns expect judges know 
worth noting category achieved results presumably location names cluster appositives conjunctions nominal compounds 
commercial category chose seed words store shop market 
new commercial words identified hotel restaurant 
retrospect realized probably words muc corpus referred commercial establishments 
muc corpus mainly contains reports terrorist military events 
relatively poor performance energy category probably due problem 
category represented corpus doomed inappropriate words seed words early iterations quickly feedback loop 
person category produced mixed results 
category words rebel criminal citizen 
words referred organizations groups forces actions attacks 
words reasonable hard draw line specific people concepts organizations groups may may consist entirely people
