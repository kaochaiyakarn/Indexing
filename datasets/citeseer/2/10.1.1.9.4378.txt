proposed approach employs fully unsupervised segmentation algorithm divide images regions 
low level features describing color position size shape resulting regions extracted automatically mapped appropriate descriptors forming simple vocabulary termed object ontology 
object ontology allow qualitative definition high level concepts user queries semantic objects represented keyword human centered fashion 
querying clearly irrelevant image regions rejected intermediate level descriptors relevance feedback mechanism employing low level features invoked produce final query results 
proposed approach bridges gap keyword approaches assume existence rich image captions require manual evaluation annotation image collection query example approaches assume user queries images similar disposal
