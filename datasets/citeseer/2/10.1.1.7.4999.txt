burgess able demonstrate cognitive compatibility hal vectors human processing series word matching word similarity experiments notable results respect semantic association words 
hal vectors promising candidate representing semantic context 
number areas concern regard ing employment hal vectors deriving conversational implicature 
firstly utterances provide small amount data mine 
burgess corpus words experiments hal 
note dimensional space high salient dimensions fewer number think dimensional space accurate estimate required simulating human memory 
effects vector elements account significant amount variance shortening vectors important keep vector elements informative 
basis hal small data sets justified provided salient dimensions weighted accordingly 
second area concern hal lack explicit representation context 
shown hal derive aspects pre semantic context results rely large amounts data 
reason enhanced hal representation aspects context explicitly pos index expressions described earlier 
details enhancement provided shortly 
hal designed finding global occurrence mixture global local occurrence performing 
burgess lund speculated suspect global occurrence models local cooccurrence models better capture richness cognitive language effects important comprehension process global cooccurrence refers vector representations embodying word associations derived context corpus 
example vector representation word bank may contain dimensions corresponding financial sense word river bank sense 
words global occurrence models hal produce accumulated vector representation word summed various contexts windows word appears 
small sets utterance may allow accumulation windows produce vector representations words 
assumption pre semantic context reduce reliance larger amounts data produce vector representations
