davison results show similar trade enlarging size link context adding words 
baseline methods arbitrary size text windows find best average context similarity obtained words 
best average context similarity significantly worse method just sets aggregation node sample anchor parent 
zero similarity frequency lower better methods uses anchor parent aggregation 
find sample optimal aggregation node anchor parent grand parent nodes
