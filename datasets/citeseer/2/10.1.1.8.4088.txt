program convert ascii binary files vice versa automatically allocate print dense cpts 
note crucial convert parameter files binary soon possible reading ascii doubly slow ascii files processed cpp takes time convert parameter values ascii binary 
fact cpp take minutes process large ascii files 
files converted binary easily ascii quick viewing 
special file name indicates parameters written respectively read standard output stdout respectively standard input stdin depending file input output file 
mentioned section gmtk ability automatically allocate parameter objects dense cpts
