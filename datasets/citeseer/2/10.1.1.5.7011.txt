group developing testing sensors user interface systems determine messages motivate healthy behaviors 
medical system countries face impending crisis pay care aging population 
growth combined governmental health care rising cost medical procedures place enormous strain worldwide health care industry years 
ways address problem increase governmental expenditure taxation ration care develop effective preventive systems help people stay healthy living independently medical system long possible 
options inevitable group focused option 
applications proactive health care grouped follows systems detect crisis 
detecting crisis generally requires sensors typically biometric sensors worn body 
commercial cardiac monitors example continuously monitor people heart conditions indicate immediate medical care necessary 
systems detect declines health 
detecting gradual change health status generally require multiple multi modal sensors 
instance interviews medical professionals developed prototype system automatically monitor individual home congestive heart failure input sensors environment placed person 
prototype context sensitive self report user asked questions health moments questions provide diagnostic information 
context inferred sensors home 
group currently developing ubiquitous sensing technology homes mobile computing devices detect activities daily living common domestic activities 
sensor system detect changes everyday activity home enable new generation home services aging 
changes everyday activity precede declines health 
systems motivate healthy behavior 
computer identify everyday activity monitor changes proactively information may lead behavior changes help people stay healthy 
primary focus current 
cases ubiquitous computer system may increase self awareness health care fun entertaining ways presenting information 
computer system may information specific times places purposefully influence behavior 
just time messaging motivating behavior change group prototyping testing technology motivate behavior change

simple message easy understand 
just right time 
just right place 
non annoying way 
messages just right time requires computational sensing infer context sensor data 
messages just right place requires output mechanism user achieved mobile computers pda cellular phone hybrids augmented reality display technology place information directly objects home 
investigating approaches 
information non annoying way means information relevant context presentation information disrupt ongoing activity 
careful attention paid user interface design 
instance may better subtle information user receptive blatantly attempting command user 
example computer detects user took unusually long walk provides positive reinforcement informing user health benefits perceived annoying computer continuously tells user take long walk walk occurred 
group exploring non intrusive just time messaging conveyed people homes workplaces communities
