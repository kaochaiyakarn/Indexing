process case restoration sufficiently accurate capitalisation correctly associated entities resulting better recognition performance 
restoring case information equivalent distinguishing common nouns proper nouns 
particularly evident german types nouns written initial capital letter 
purpose case restoration simply reveal underlying capitalisation model language allowing machine learners learn accurately orthography
