section describes roles formed second roles configured terms number complexity actions supported role degree control agent various actions 
role formation roles assigned agents multiagent system ways endogenously emergent self organization system runs exogenously system designer system constructed modified 
endogenous self organization widespread phenomenon natural systems 
agents interact system level structures patterns emerge adapt robustly changes system environment 
role differentiation social insects prominent example self organization 
instance individual wasps nest spontaneously take different roles nurse vs forager vs chief response changing food resources brood sizes 
synthetic systems exploit similar dynamics 
experiments information brokers web information system show brokers specialize complementary niches adopting distinct information roles 
self organizing role assignment robust system change replaces expensive time consuming human design effort autonomous configuration 
particularly attractive way design systems domains subject unexpected change 
human social structures intuitively familiar ultimately generated maintained emergent self organization 
social psychologists suggest roles formed recurring set behaviors useful group context 
initially behavior actions single individual 
time individual actions identified useful set behaviors employed individuals produce similar results 
reusable set actions standardized form role 
roles extracted analytically techniques social network analysis graphs 
reasons want existing human structural patterns impose exogenously multiagent system design time 
reasons fall main categories cognitive fit dynamic properties 
imposed roles may preferable emergent roles system interface closely human agents 
usually different ways roles assigned set agents function 
roles emerge selforganizing digital system may align naturally human organization adopt address function 
difference difficult people understand behavior digital system 
human stakeholders understand system trust severely compromising usefulness 
dynamically imposed roles may useful initiating system wishes apply emergent self organization 
initializes multiagent system set roles known provide desired functionality human organizations greatly reduces burden subsequent self organization 
searching entire space possible role assignments self organization fine tune initial assignment reducing operating time necessary achieve desired level function 
starting known human roles encourages self organization find assignments close roles tractable human cognition

synthesis approaches major area current research 
role configuration configuring role thought dimensions breadth depth 
role breadth horizontal specialization addresses number complexity actions supported role 
depth vertical specialization separates performance actions administration 
relates degree control agent actions actions agents 
horizontal specialization roles extreme role require agent jack trades handling kind request 
scenario horizontal specialization fat homogeneous agents 
small simple organizations versatility useful 
large diversified organizations human mas systems agents expected 
diversity limited capability guidelines role design 
extreme role simply require repertoire single highly specialized action 
approach common traditional assembly line worker single specific task perform 
simple roles primary characteristics 
incumbent role assignment perform action separately independently role assignments 
second incumbent perform task knowing assembly line actions fit produce product 
simple roles commonly provide building blocks easier understand simpler develop broadly defined roles 
resulting population narrowly defined roles larger elaborate ones reasons 
simpler individual role roles required complex activity accomplish goal 
narrow design simple roles require coordinator roles organize 
coordination required simple roles particularly occur roles mechanisms mutual adjustment standards stigmergy 
coordinator roles just mechanisms obtaining coordination 
high level horizontal specialization particularly useful situations exist independent action useful understanding exists actions fit deliver product 
degree horizontal specialization increase productivity reasons specialized roles identified specified repetitive actions expected produce successful results 
incremental improvement encouraged due modular nature 
actions specialized standardized tend smaller simpler units behavior 
incrementally modifying behavior fine grain level tends easier coarse grain level 
role assignment particular criteria enabling system match assign individual agent role 
specialization matter degree role include specialized action actions broad narrow 
richer complex role greater requirements agent filling role assign ment 
coarse grained roles carry problems benefits coarsegrained components 
example driving hook ladder fire engine requires front driver rear driver navigator 
performs separate specialized action depends close coordination 
actions predominantly concurrent interdependent assembly line specialization described involves actions predominantly serially dependent nature 
words roles specialized traditional assembly line worker role concerned close coordination roles 
vertical specialization roles horizontal specialization addresses performance vertical specialization addresses management 
precisely vertical specialization addresses degree control role actions actions roles 
management roles implement tasks associated planning coordination monitoring agents group 
primary purpose specializing roles vertically insure horizontally specialized behavior results identified goals 
essence roles define management functions administer linkage agents playing planned horizontal roles 
manager roles differ terms control breadth management level control 
cases manage behavior leads specific goals 
extreme role agent simply carries activities directed agent narrow vertically 
contrast role agent assumes control decision making agents vertically broad 
shift passive responder active manager way saying role vertical dimension shifts narrow specialized broader general 
far extreme vertical generalization fat jack managers role control actions agent including 
extremes exists range possibilities 
example manager role require management system agent requires checks balances 
simple agent follow simple rules involving agentbased pheromones 
instance detects pheromone follow scent gradient food manager role necessary 
fact effective solutions agent organizational designs employ swarm intelligence techniques require little vertical specialization 
forms human organizations require management roles 
vertical specialization human organizations armed forces legal systems fail utterly 
role assignments positions roles established actors may play

called positions 
position officially recognized potential role assignment group structure 
position may may agent assigned 
agent may associated point time 
different agents may associated position time 
notion position useful organization designers encourages designer identify specify jobs need performed 
accomplished agents physically exist fill positions 
position established long periods time merely created brief ad hoc usage 
example long term positions include positions facilitators librarians 
short term positions established instance workflow activity 
instance workflow order include activities accept order fill order ship order 
temporary position activity defined order filled qualified agent 
manager agent charge order workflow responsible creating filling position 
activity completes job position terminated 
fact manager job short term position order workflow filled needed agent designed general order processing manager 
words defining positions enables system designers agent managers anticipate organizational needs specifying positions populating 
create positions fly fill agents deem qualified 
remove agent position function effectively platform agent overloaded activities particular moment replaced agent 
fill position serially different agents time allowing agents purchased different vendors constructed specific platforms particular languages adapted time fill position 
short position specification agent fulfill potentially 
specifies role assigned criteria occupying position supervisory relationship positions 
nature positions partition organization discrete processing units placing barriers organization 
organizations thought seamless entities aggregations positions communicate coordinate 
positions complexity organization positions vertical horizontal 
fewer positions complexity inside agent 
complex environment positions 
position specialization creates balancing problem 
positions partitioned specialized positions kind created 
example sales positions specialized merchandise sales service sales positions created 
sales positions new specialization 
optimal number 
happens number required time swings widely needing service sales positions needing merchandise sales positions 
having single type sales position handles situations 
merchandise service sales situations vastly different single type sales position require duties skills responsibilities supervisory relationships agent adequately satisfy
