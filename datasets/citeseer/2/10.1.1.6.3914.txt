supporting knowledge sharing online imagine group students gather table solve problem exchange knowledge brings bear problem 
group member brings table unique pool knowledge grounded individual experiences 
combination experiences ontological members understanding group members personalities behaviors determine collaboration proceeds group members effectively learn 
group members effectively share knowledge individually bring group learning situation difficult time establishing shared understanding constructing new knowledge 
difficulties ultimately lead poor learning outcomes making research efforts understand support student knowledge sharing activities essential
