context aware computing promises smooth interaction humans technology studies conducted regards interactive application 
defining levels interactivity mobile computing device user personalization passive context awareness active context awareness test approach limit users perceived sense control 
investigate users preferences approaches 
conducted experimental case study mobile phone applications exemplify personalization context aware approaches 
result study users feel control passive active context aware applications personalizing applications 
shown despite loss power context aware applications preferred personalization oriented ones 
conclude people willing give partial control reward usefulness great 
context aware computing aims facilitate smooth interaction humans technology studies users perceive context aware interaction performed 
research focuses development technologies context awareness design context aware applications 
example applications numerous level interactivity varies greatly ranging letting user manually define parameters application behave automatically providing user services information developer finds relevant

active context awareness describes applications basis measured sensor data change content autonomously passive context aware applications merely updated context user user specify application change 
simple example active contextaware application mobile phone changes time automatically phone enters new time zone 
corresponding passive context aware application mobile phone prompts user information time zone change lets user choose time updated

general finding active context awareness approach preferred 
account fact participants high level users defined calls day low level users defined calls day finding active context awareness slightly preferred consistent 
results expected provide interesting insight users perception control preference interactivity levels elaborate discussion 
discussion finding participants felt control context aware groups preferred context aware approaches contradictory 
considered owning mobile phone constitutes lack control user reached anytime user control aware cost interactive achieving smoother everyday experience 
study results provide support highly interactive applications mobile computing indicating people fairly high degree applications developed caution 
incurred cost due loss control result users turning service 
participants initially liked active context aware services frustrated perceived lack control eventually turn service 
lastly noted participants equipped highly interactive mobile phone duration study imaginary approaches sufficient tell users behave self reported 
commonly observed factor potential users may disregard technology priori may adopt anyway various reasons 
examples include text messages phone reasons adopt communication form peer pressure change attitude due realization value provides

study shows participants feel lack control autonomous interactivity approaches prefer active passive context aware features personalization oriented applications cases 
users willing accept large degree autonomy applications long application usefulness greater cost limited control 
study theoretical evaluation levels interactivity logical step develop actual context aware personalization oriented services 
user tested parameters study compared people rated virtual services 
complement diary interviews observational methods accurately determine users handle highly interactive applications
