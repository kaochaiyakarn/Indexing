sensing applications unencumbered virtual reality interfaces performance spaces information browsers common need track interpret human action 
step process identifying tracking key features robust real time non intrusive way 
computer vision tool capable solving problem situations application domains 
real time computer vision techniques able interpret people posture movement gestures identity 
wren shown system image dimensional description human body set adjacent color regions head torso hands feet map estimator color pixel classification kalman filter applied features track powerful tool mathematically computationally describe human body motion real time 
similar maximum likelihood statistical approaches effective stereo vision tracking locate body features accurately space pointing direction accurate depth information needed 
hidden markov models bayesian networks successfully classify human movements gestures 

robustness multimodal perception robust sensing premise correct interpretation user intention 
applications rely unique sensor modality acquire information people brittle prone error 
sensor works individually camera radar electric field sensor provides system single view going 
order body driven interactive application offer reliable robust response large number people daily basis needed museum meet challenges variable unpredictable factors real life situation need rely variety sensors cooperate gather correct reliable measurements user 
cooperation sensor modalities various degrees redundancy complementarity guarantee robust accurate perception 
redundancy sensors register data provide 
complementarity sensors resolve ambiguity reduce errors environmental perturbation affects system 

context data interpretation reliable measurements user need able interpret measurements context user trying digital media want people get experiences wish offer 
similar gesture public different meanings context history interaction 
example pointing gesture hand interpreted pushing virtual character simply selection gesture 
similar way system needs develop expectations likelihood user responses specific content shown 
expectations influence turn interpretation sensory data 
previous example teaching user system perform recognize slightly different gestures pushing selecting simply teach system correctly interpret slightly similar gestures context history interaction developing expectations probability follow gesture 
summary systems need user model characterizes behavior likelihood responses public 
model need flexible adaptively revised learning user interaction profile 

narrative engines difficult produce compelling applications simply direct mapping sensor measurement inputs digital media output 
strategy may simple interactive environments effective orchestrate digital information effectively 
current interactive systems defined series couplings user input system responses
