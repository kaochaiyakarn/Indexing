time go authors insist part holds entities single hierarchy go vocabulary sets general provided little guidance role different sorts temporal entities ontology relations term hierarchies go constituted 
shall return problems 
ontological distinctions go increases size scope go consortium accepts increasingly difficult maintain semantic consistency desire software tools perform consistency checks controlled updates 
gene ontology expands useful researchers semantic integrity time difficult maintain manual inspection curation 
addition new term require curator understand entire structure go order avoid redundancy ensure appropriate linkages terms 
method improve current approach explicit criteria discriminating introducing decision tree methodology construction hierarchy 
involve recording explicit statements basis classification choices enable retrospective checking 
addition facilitate reliable identification concepts ontology 
believe reap full benefits methodology certain distinctions drawn philosophical need kept mind universals vs particulars philosophers distinguish universals called kinds species types particulars called individuals exemplars instances tokens 
examples universals species coli function boost insulin production 
examples particulars coli bacterium existing petri dish function gene boost insulin production beta cells 
go terms correspond philosophical terminology universals entities multiply instantiable 
universal corresponding term cell instantiated actual cell 
continuants vs occurrents orthogonal distinction universals particulars continuants occurrents 
continuants name implies entities continue exist time 
organisms cells chromosomes continuants preserve identity moment undergoing variety different sorts changes 
parts continuants example arms legs continu ants 
principal mark continuant exists time parts 
occurrents called events processes activities contrast exist full single instant time unfold successive phases way example process viral infection unfolds time 
processes characteristically middle 
arm part youth part process life 
note part relations cross continuant occurrent divide 
dependent vs independent entities planets people molecules atoms inherent ability exist support entities

go cellular component ontology terms ontology substance universals molecular function biological process ontologies ontologies function process universals 
functions perspective philosophical ontology continuants 
object function means token function interval time token function full instant interval 
unfold phases manner occurrent 
token function gets exercised token process results unfold manner 
function gives rise exercised processes activities characteristic types 
tempting light conceive relation go molecular function hierarchy biological process hierarchy function exercise function 
biological processes accomplished assemblies molecular functions exercised ways reflect assemblies cellular components functions functions 
advantage solution allows justice fact function continues exist dormant reason exercised 
relabeling step march clear solution lines go authors mind 
relabeling functions activities signifies go authors hold molecular functions occurrent continuant entities 
clarity sake take step relabeling molecular function hierarchy molecular activity hierarchy 
understand relabeling step correctly function fact means functioning signifies function exercised potential exercised 
assign function activity gene product necessarily assert product possesses times potential perform activity 
hand go introductory documentation states molecular function defines tasks physical gene product gene product group potential emphasis added believe go considers potential indicate ability perform activity appropriate circumstances 
instance transporter protein complex expected demonstrate transporter activity substrate transports 
molecular function nodes relabeled activities term activity mean activity potential activity certain circumstances 
believe failure resolve problems reveals coding errors instance definitions terms transporter go 
currently june defined enables directed movement substances macromolecules small molecules ions cell transporter activity properly defined directed movement better catalysis movement 
resolve problem relation molecular function biological process hierarchies 
solution terms function exercise longer available part relations allowed traverse go hierarchies know solution replace 
dependent independent entities go go cellular component ontology contains terms denoting independent entities function activity terms denote dependent entities means entities necessary substances 
binding function activity dependent molecules molecule parts involved binding occurs 
biological process hierarchy encompasses dependent entities 
occurrents require support substance order allow occur 
consider example term go defined physiological developmental changes seed pollen grain zygote occur release 
evident process expressed means substance 
clear example viral life cycle go defined set processes virus reproduces 
go relations relation isa go documentation refers isa meaning instance isa relation clearly way indicate kind specialization relations universals eukaryotic cell cell instantiation relations particular entities universal kinds 
isa relation distinct relation part 
confusingly isa meaning part definition hydrogen transporting domain go treats domains kinds type complexes component parts thereof 
believe errors derive lack attention ontological principles 
isa relation intended meaning indicates necessary relationship 
say eukaryotic cell isa cell mean eukaryotic cell cell 
cases go isa indicate non necessary subsumption 
example term transport defined go june meaning directed movement substances macromolecules small molecules ions cell term cell process involving controlled movement cell term cell growth maintenance process required survival growth cell connected isa 
go statement transport isa cell growth maintenance read indicating transport process cell growth maintenance process true transports viral intracellular protein transport go 
relation part intended meaning partof explained go usage guide part part 
addition part relation intended behave transitively 
go uses part representation parts substances processes activation part fertilization functions activities 
part appears kinds statements membrane part cell intended mean membrane part cell part cell intended mean part cells replication fork part cell intended mean replication fork part cell certain times cell cycle regulation sleep part sleep corrected regulation sleep located causally involved sleep process 
believe usages represented different relation system relations involved explicitly 
means extending ontology take explicit account notion time ways time involved example determining different part relations 
revision lines addition bring greater adaptability purposes automated reasoning dynamic aspects biological phenomena 
benefits go approach go approach brought considerable benefits populating go start immediately authors needing solve intricate problems face ontologies formalized logical theories 
populating go require completion complex protocols formally determined steps done intuitively expert biologist 
formal constraints standing way easy incorporation existing controlled vocabularies biological domain 
principle unique identifiers allows go terms database annotation consideration place go hierarchy 
drawbacks go approach focusing rapid population go drawbacks unclear kinds reasoning permissible basis go hierarchies 
rationale go unclear 
reasoning went current choices preserved explained re examined third party 
procedures offered go validated 
insufficient rules determining recognize concept go 
mere string search presupposes concepts single standardized representation case 
modest proposal 
consisted initial analysis go terms organization respect basic ontological distinctions 
proposal basic distinctions determine revised upper level ontology go relations existing hierarchies roles go central ontological notions including various existing uses partof process action activity clearly specified branches divided accordingly 
time definitions formulated way records conditions stated relations applicable 
easy task determine large intellectual investment proposal require necessary steps instance substitution activity function name go molecular function ontology involve cost 
convinced benefits significantly outweigh costs involved 
biological concepts come represented formally go robust ontological architecture lines suggested help avoid coding errors ensure computer systems able assume burden ontology curation ensure systems better able go basis automated reasoning facilitate go interoperability biological databases terminology systems associated ontologies
