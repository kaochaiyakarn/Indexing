software user interface 

experiment software software designed sri international demonstrate automatic pronunciation scoring reading task 
focus user interface explicitly designed long term 
read user selects phrase sentence paragraph text play native speaker recording selection normal speed slow careful style 
user record voice reading selection play back 
user free repeat selection desired move 
includes speech recognizer aligns user speech broad phonetic transcription selected text calculates log posterior probability scores speech 
log posterior probability scores mapped scale best correlation human listeners ratings degree obtained 
sufficient speech correlation scores average assigned panel human listeners comparable human listeners :10.1.1.8.4690

recording sessions subjects wore small headset microphone read sentences practice analysis sampled khz saved directly digital format 
sentences recording sessions chosen include number sounds sequences expected problematic contained relatively simple vocabulary 
research assistant monitored microphone placement audio quality session

analysis results measures user pronunciation performance assessed ways 
average log posterior probabilities phone detailed measures spectral match user speech statistical models trained native speakers :10.1.1.8.4690
measure called posterior score 
second speech rate expressed number phones unit time speech recognizer phonetic segmentation 
phones adjacent silence omitted potentially unreliable segmentations 
covariates covariates expected associated changes pronunciation time logged software 
included number utterances produced practice sessions number times native speaker example played practice sessions number times user listened voice practice sessions

analysis covariance planned remove effects uncontrolled variables examining effect pronunciation feedback 
analysis covariance requires treatments covariates independent 
tests check practice groups differed total number utterances produced native examples listened 
significant differences unequal variance sided test df respectively 
practice groups differ number utterances native examples minute practice time df respectively 
concluded assumption independence treatments covariates reasonable 
addition linear regressions revealed significant correlations hand number utterances produced number native examples heard hand change posterior score change speech rate practice group

significant effect practice group membership speech rate number utterances produced number native examples heard amount practice time taken account 
number native examples heard practice time significantly related change speech rate

negative indicates subject spoke quickly second time recorded weeks 
interesting note signs coefficients longer time spent associated slower speech listening native examples associated increase speech rate 
possible increased practice time leads slower speech increased attention pronunciation

summary discussion results summarised follows practice groups differ utterances produced times listened native speaker examples total minute practice 
significant difference practice groups change posterior scores change speech rate 
practice groups increasing speech rate significantly correlated increasing native examples decreasing practice time
