static perspective oesophagus ontology captures static relations various concepts domain relations time play role separate component 
component types relation distinguished structural relations definitional relations 
structural relations concepts domain typically related di erent ways 
concept may example generalisation superset concept 
may property concept 
relations essence describe structure domain knowledge termed structural relations 
studying structural relations domain cancer resulted number hierarchies 
example fig 
shows hierarchy pathological entities hierarchy simplified ease presentation 
pathological entities term pathological indicates entity deviates considered normal primary importance domain 
node hierarchy pathological entities captures object domain represents set individual entities 
link separately describes subset relation link directed subset superset 
links pointing single superset assumed originate mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive subsets called blocks links capture partition superset

ontology chosen direct links subset superset direction block relation directed links superset subset direction partitions relation 
associated various objects hierarchy attributes 
distinguish element attributes set attributes 
element attribute describes property element attributes set attributes primary tumour set attributes secondary tumour site stage presence element attributes set attributes tumour metastasis presence anatomy class length shape anatomy oesophagus anatomy depth primary site anatomy primary site relative location nm class presence presence presence set attributes presence set attributes element attributes local metastasis presence element attributes set attributes metastasis lungs site anatomy lungs anatomy liver site element attributes presence set attributes metastasis liver presence set attributes metastasis relative location set attributes presence pathological entity set attributes node neck anatomy lymph site relative location presence metastasis neck element attributes set attributes node oesophagus anatomy lymph site hierarchy pathological entities individual element associated set 
example individual set site 
links hierarchy capture partition relation element attributes associated particular node associated nodes describe subsets 
individuals set primary subset set associated site 
similarly concrete values specified element attributes node associated attributes nodes describe subsets 
allow implicit exceptions 
addition element attributes object associated set attributes specify properties represented set 
example set attribute presence object tumour represents presence tumour patient 
attribute value patient may primary tumour secondary 
set attribute presence object secondary tumour necessarily value 
knowledge needed establishing value set attribute domain independent 
example attribute presence set metastasis value attribute presence subsets value 
type knowledge considered common sense knowledge specified explicitly ontology reasons clarity 
set attributes require domain dependent knowledge establishing values 
example attribute stage node tumour 
attribute basically captures set attributes status test set attributes status set attributes ct scan status ct set attributes status ct abdomen set attributes status ray set attributes status set attributes status set attributes ray status 
hierarchy tests stage set cancer 
domain knowledge required establish value specified explicitly ontology definitional relations 
definitional relations constitute second type static relation discussed detail 
attribute element set attribute specify just value object 
depicted hierarchy name hierarchy object located node colon name referenced object 
example attribute site object metastasis liver specifies object liver hierarchy anatomical knowledge 
attributes may specify domain declarations 
example depth invasion tumour primary site specified layers wall oesophagus 
set possible values attribute specified node equal restriction set values specified parent node 
conclude hierarchy seen place holder data single patient 
element set attributes specified leaf nodes internal nodes assigned patient specific value 
hierarchy pathological entities assumed sets represented leaf node contain individual assume example patient primary tumour 
constructing oesophagus ontology noticed organising structural relations concepts domain easy sight 
di erent ways organising concepts hierarchies having specific advantages disadvantages 
illustrate observation hierarchies tests test results 
hierarchies shown fig 
hierarchies simplified ease presentation 
hierarchy tests shown fig 
contains nodes represent tests gain information hidden pathological entities 
example ct scan gather information presence absence lungs 
organising di erent tests hierarchy tumour test result primary outside primary site test result depth test result length value element attributes ray lungs test result value element attributes ct lungs test result test result element attributes value test result ct value element attributes test result value element attributes test result ct element attributes value length test result test result test result metastasis lungs 
hierarchy test results took technology site applied criterion 
example ct scan ray di erent technologies represented nodes level hierarchy 
ct scan applied represented node ct scan lower abdomen liver located represented node ct scan abdomen 
properties test costs involved included hierarchy element attributes 
reliability characteristics test included common practice field medical decision making 
essence organised results outcomes various tests hierarchy example adding appropriate attributes objects represent tests 
chose capture test results separate hierarchy shown fig 

hierarchy results tests organised entities provide information 
example ct scan ray serve yield information presence absence secondary tumour lungs 
results sets represented separate nodes linked node test result metastasis lungs 
merged knowledge tests results single hierarchy information respect single pathological entity distributed hierarchy 
similar reasons decided extend hierarchy test results include knowledge tests performed obtain 
knowledge test example sites applied distributed hierarchy test results 
example ct scan applied lower abdomen yielding test results respect di erent pathological entities 
addition single ct scan multiple results providing information di erent pathological entities 
example single ct scan may provide information presence absence lungs depth invasion primary tumour organs just oesophagus 
test results respect di erent entities obtained single technology may obtained applying single test multiple results applying technology multiple sites 
including knowledge tests hierarchy test results may obscure knowledge respect sites test applied 
representing structural relations respect tests results separate hierarchies feel captured structure knowledge faithfully merging knowledge single hierarchy 
conclude note explicitly distinguished test results values attributes hand pathological entities attribute values hand test results perfectly reflect true value entity attribute 
addition hierarchies discussed oesophagus ontology contains hierarchy pathological processes 
processes underlie progression disease play important role domain application 
knowledge manifestations diseases weight loss problems captured hierarchy manifestations 
manifestations disease explicitly distinguished test results manifestations typically noticed patient require test observation

definitional relations second type static relation distinguished oesophagus ontology definitional relation 
definitional relation relation attribute values basically defines value attribute terms values attributes

incoming arcs attribute originate attributes values serve define value 
graph abstracts specific values shows attributes related value level basically constitutes additional description level

distinguishing various types dynamic relation build concept state 
state reflects specific situation time property entity certain value entity object ontology excepting pathological processes 
causing relation asserts particular state may cause state occur 
relation state precede time

continuous causation denotes cause needs continuously ect persist 
example continuous causation relation patient di culties food weight loss

example liver occur continuous existence independent presence cause 
ontology adopted distinction 
attach causing relation label denoting capturing shot continuous causation 
addition specify causing relation occurrence ect may delayed onset cause 
causing relation labeled capturing continuous causation indicate delay may occur termination ect cause halted
