information personalized expressive art describes design highly versatile ambient display 
novel interface people identify information interest paint appealing meaningful representation virtual canvas communication back 
new form interaction information allows people keep tabs useful peripheral information calm unobtrusive manner 
keywords information awareness ambient display peripheral information display visualization existing ambient display tools seek increase awareness information visual aural physical effects 
ambient tools limited representing sources information time sources information predetermined hardwired 
furthermore tools typically allow user configuration current status information may occurred user absent 
overcome limitations developing facilitates calm ambient awareness information flexibility higher bandwidth existing ambient displays 
overview people variety information want maintain peripheral awareness stocks weather traffic online type data really convenience information absolutely critical knowing helpful different ways 
vision information display may manifested large flat panel display office wall picture frame display desk shown 
display shows visually appealing scene favorite painting photograph presentation conveys convenience information user 
example display scene weather represents stock market activity cars todd miller john stasko college computing gvu center georgia institute technology atlanta ga usa stasko cc gatech edu road represent traffic conditions number flowers field corresponds new email messages 
vision user able specify information sources interest paint scene representing information effectively mapping canvas 
canvas run display device flat panel lcd monitor pertinent information subtly update appropriately 
environment approach similar project uses lcd panels ambient displays depict email traffic flow web site usage 
displays predetermined source information modify particular aspects art 
conversely allowing users express creative designs key part effort 
painting information steps painting information specifying information represented visually mapping data canvas 
illustrative purposes walk specific example representing stock market conditions weather landscape canvas 
information sources step painting information identify source 
currently accepts data email accounts web pages 
certain rules applied source extracting interpreting data 
rules applied email source monitor number messages arrival new messages new messages particular person particular keyword subject reply arrives 
web pages monitored general update content presence keyword content value extracted associated keyword kps mining algorithm 
multiple rules assigned source rule having unique representation canvas 
representing stock market identify page yahoo data source presents detail dow index copying url source definition dialog box 
set extract value associated keyword rule give keyword change 
find instance word change page extract value immediately number represents change index day 
design palette information source identified method extracting data defined user paint representation information canvas tools available design palette shown 
design palette consists drawing tools menu icons 
drawing tools provide simple painting capabilities paint brushes lines circles color selection manipulator buttons defining ways vary representation 
manipulators allow drawing scaled rotated moved colored 
currently works numeric data value associated keyword web page numeric value amount scale rotate move color 
non numeric data simply trigger representation information visible rule conditions satisfied ex 
new mail arrives 
icons dragged canvas palette manipulated quickly create representation information relieving need artistic skills 
user choose represent information 
complex drawings created third party programs imported set icons palette 
screenshot canvas palette stock market data source defined paint sun change color numeric value extracted data source 
paint brush tool draw sun canvas 
color vary value extracted hue shift manipulator 
adjusts hue sun yellow day reddish bad day 
manipulations moving sun path adjusting opacity represent market conditions 
canvas information painted top backdrop provided canvas 
scene deployed canvas monitor information sources subtly update representation 
additionally scaled size allowing user room desired paint information 
lastly created shared users file saved loaded 
gives flexibility user switch different paintings created 
status initial versions components described implemented functional 
email web data sources available basic sets rules assisting user identifying information interest 
extracting data web pages quite difficult existing kps algorithm greatly enhanced 
canvas currently provides rudimentary drawing editor palette icons imported 
running able monitor information represent periodically polling data sources checking new updated information 
currently expanding set data sources include physical sensors calendars lists printer queues network traffic generic rules building complex representations 
plan explore collaborative shared 
project team visualize progress reminders status items shared display 
study examine patterns actual usage identify interface issues planned
