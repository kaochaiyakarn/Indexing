rei cation option 
common technique exploited temporal representation formalisms increase expressive power abandoning rst order logical framework rei cation 
problems temporal reasoning require dealing propositions truth values change function time 
adding temporal arguments time varying predicate rei ed formalisms treat propositions original object language terms metalanguage relate time suitable truth meta predicates 
example allen rei ed theory actions time fact block block time interval expressed formula holds formula 
assigning special status time temporal rei cation advantage allowing quanti cation propositions 
feature possible express assertions ects precede causes captured non rei ed rst order formalisms 
meta predicate causes propositional terms arguments condition expressed rei ed formalism follows causes holds causes holds propositional variables temporal variables 
formula interpreted follows holds spontaneous holds caused time preceding causes took place 
major disadvantage rei ed formalisms require addition sort structure distinguish terms denote real objects domain terms original object language terms denote propositional objects propositions original object language 
structure prevents formation meaningless terms terms obtained applying functions original object language propositional terms 
interesting example sorted rei ed formalism provided lifschitz

situation calculus 
basic concepts model change situation calculus sc situation action 
mccarthy hayes situation complete state modelled portion world instant time sc deals hypothetical situations agent bring situation :10.1.1.85.5082:10.1.1.85.5082
hypothetical situations consist set facts true considered instant time 
world amenable complete description complete knowledge initial state available sc boil logical counterpart strips 
world typically large complete description possible provide full set facts meaningful subset 
sc partial information situations means uents 
uent function domain set situations sit 
mccarthy hayes distinguish propositional uents range set ftrue falseg situational uents range sit 
cases propositional uents values functions 
example raining propositional uent raining equivalently raining rewritten variables function evaluates true raining place situation :10.1.1.85.5082:10.1.1.85.5082

instance result putdown result walk result pickup constant denoting initial situation situation denoting world history consisting sequence actions pickup walk putdown 
rst argument result disappeared subsequent versions sc information agent embedded representation performed action

re nement sketched detailed :10.1.1.85.5082:10.1.1.85.5082
basic claim occurrence event situation ect truth value uents 
consequence assume default uent action situation result formalize statement mccarthy extends sc special predicate ab uent action situation ab holds occurrence action situation causes uent change truth value 
example express condition occurrence action situation uent awake false person situation follows ab awake practical cases need restrict abnormality set situations satisfying certain conditions 
example abnormal person remains alive loaded gun shot absolutely reasonable gun unloaded 
conditional abnormality expressed means sentence loaded ab alive shoot sake simplicity omit gun argument loaded shoot person argument alive 
chittaro montanari temporal representation reasoning ai mccarthy solution exploits predicate ab state normal uents change values normal events occur 
order able quantify propositional uents actions rst order formalism introduce rei ed version sc truth uent situation expressed formula holds 
persistence normal uents occurrence normal events codi ed means formula holds ab holds result way frame problem reduced problem deriving ab situation uent action normal 
mccarthy proposes minimize abnormal temporal individuals triplets satisfying predicate ab circumscribing predicate ab holds varied 
intuitively asserting extent ab small possible possible law inertia possible determine value uents result unfortunately hanks mcdermott demonstrate minimization abnormalities meet goal sucient guarantee normal uent change truth value moving situation 
prove claim yale shooting problem

consider scenario involving propositional uents loaded alive respectively concern state gun person events wait shoot 
appropriate commonsense knowledge states loaded gun shot person person dies holds loaded ab alive shoot suppose initial situation gun loaded person alive holds loaded holds alive events wait shoot occur succession 
laws constraining ects wait expect ect state gun gun remain loaded occurrence 
unfortunately circumscribing ab produces di erent minimal models

model contains abnormality shooting event

event calculus 
event calculus ec originally introduced kowalski sergot logic programming framework representing reasoning events ects 
axiomatization ec classical logic circumscription method default reasoning solve frame related problems summarized alternative axiomatizations ec classical logic described basic concepts model time change ec event property 
properties uents hold time periods initiated terminated event occurrences 
predicate initiates state event initiates property example event hire hiring person initiates period time property rank holds 
original ec proposal fact represented holds hire rank event property denotes time period started event unde ned property holds 
properties assumed persist event occurs interrupts persistence 
similar way terminates means event terminates property example event promote promoting rank rank terminates period time property rank holds 
fact represented holds promote rank event property denotes time period ended event unde ned property holds 
original ec formulation treats past symmetrically occurrence terminating event allows conclude property holds event past persistence possibly initiating event 
description events occur real world properties initiate terminate ec derives property holds nite time period known holds event event precedes event occurring ects case periods coincide 
example assuming events ecting rank occur hire promote concluded rank holds 
initiation termination properties context dependent requiring preconditions hold event occurrence time 
subsequent literature ec simpli es original formulation calculus loss generality time points basic temporal elements replacing time periods pairs time points intervals

chittaro montanari temporal representation reasoning ai sadri kowalski propose version ec captures common features variants 
logic programming formulation ec adheres unifying perspective 
notions event property time point interval primitives formalism events happen time points initiate terminate intervals properties hold 
real line time points assumed events happen time points belonging 
event occurrence represented associating event time point occurred means happens event timepoint clause 
relation events properties de ned means initiates terminates clauses form initiates event property happens event holds prop holds propn terminates event property happens event holds prop holds propn initiates terminates clause states event type event initiates terminates period time property holds provided possibly zero preconditions hold instant model time change ec concerned determining time points properties hold 
example consider initiating event marked subsequent terminating events property holds hold interrupting event clip interval 
model time change ec de ned means axioms holdsat initiates ei start start clipped start clipped terminates holdsat axiom states property holds time event ei initiates occurs provided known interruption negation front clipped predicate interpreted negation failure 
clipped predicate states property interrupted time interval event happens terminates axiom provides called weak interpretation initiates predicate initiating event initiates validity interval property provided property hold time point occurrence 
example interpretation applied initiating events followed terminating event validity interval property 
general case consider ordered sequence events initiating property followed event terminating weak interpretation ec derives validity outermost initiating event terminating event note holdsat axiom conventionally assumes property valid starting point validity interval valid point 
example valid instant greater equal 
chittaro montanari temporal representation reasoning ai examples validity interval weak strong interpretation 
weak interpretation needed aggregate homogeneous states 
consider problem monitoring patients receive therapeutic assistance 
context happens data acquired consecutive samplings cause transition classi cation patient state 
adopting weak interpretation second data acquisition clip validity interval condition patient initiated rst 
weak interpretation frequently literature proved useful experience medical applications 
alternative interpretation called strong interpretation adopted interpretation originally adopted kowalski sergot 
property clipped point time interval start event initiates terminates occurring time applying events obtain validity interval depicted 
example consider ordered sequence initiating events followed terminating event strong interpretation ec derive validity innermost initiating event support strong interpretation de nition clipped slightly extended initiating events clip validity property basic version ec guarantees correctness derived validity intervals complete knowledge set occurred events temporal order available may produce incorrect results

give example incomplete sequence events consider switch take di erent positions 
behavior described means events changes position turn events occur consecutively real world may happen chittaro montanari temporal representation reasoning ai incomplete sequence consisting consecutive turn events followed turn event recorded database 
deal kind problems kowalski sergot propose introduce suitable rules derive existence implicit points

strong interpretation initiates allows ec recognize missing turn event occurred turn events
