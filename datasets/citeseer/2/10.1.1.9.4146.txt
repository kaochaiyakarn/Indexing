mpml family character control languages mpml multi modal presentation markup language language specifically designed non expert content authors enables direct behavior multiple embodied characters web environment 
mpml markup language compliant standard xml allows scripting style familiar broad audience assuming background html scripting 
second mpml language designed aim scripting character presentations viewed web browser 
order facilitate generation different types presentations including interactive presentations mpml provides tagging structures enable authors utilize features presentations human presenters web presentations environments dynamic media objects interaction audience 
mpml supports generation multimodal presentations presentations utilizing multiple mechanisms encode information conveyed including graphics spoken synthetic language music video

mpml visual editor script authors mpml may edit file containing tagging structures character presentation control 
considering complexity presentation script deeply nested tagging structures popularity visual interfaces manipulating graphical representation corresponding script preferable 
reason mpml visual editor developed 
visual editor application program integrates modules 
script loader module loads text file containing mpml script checks script syntactical errors 
graph module visualizes script generating graphical presentation presentation 
script module converts graph textual mpml script

obtained results somewhat restricted believe embodied conversational agents affective behavior potential alleviate user frustration similar human interlocutors assessment user physiological data adequate method show effects agents 
current currently follow multiple parallel lines research extend designing interacting embodied conversational agents 
mpml allows script character behavior relatively easily remains limited creating contextsensitive adaptive affective behavior 
scream system provides tool creation sophisticated character behavior requires considerable effort prepare affective responses 
authors simply wish include interface want follow intense approach 
implemented interface mpml popular mori 
provides large set responses written artificial intelligence markup language accessible web 
major drawback approach agents scripted easily consistent personality profile show unexpected behaviors tolerable desirable chat style situations confined interaction domains black jack game educational settings 
application mpml implement character call computer assisted language learning system allows native speakers nstliche intelligenz ki zeitschrift vol pages japanese hold english conversions life agents juli 
started re implement mpml scripting animated agents running handheld devices 
mpml mobile version allows markup simple animations cellular phone platforms major japanese providers 
promising alternative achieve believable agent behavior script environments host agents agents 
doyle annotated environments concept serve starting point 
idea designer web environment adds annotations environment instruct agent react 
annotations include various types information factual affective information environment designer intent 
main advantage approach agents achieve believable behavior various environments need knowledge environment design time 
major focus current research emotion recognition technology develop adaptive character interfaces conati 
intend process physiological data real time provide tailored agent reactions user emotional state interaction task 
described major goals selected results project life embodied agents carried university tokyo 
aim developing easy markup languages synthetic characters capable affective interactions agents including human users web environments outcomes mpml family markup languages providing tagging structures controlling embodied characters presentation flow human agent interaction 
scream system offering practical technology specifying scripting mental states processes underlying agent affective behavior 
experiment involving character interface suggesting agent emphatic feedback may decrease partly undo user negative emotions
