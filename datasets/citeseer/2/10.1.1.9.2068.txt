commitments order carry program need concept serve reasonable foundation 
employ social commitment concept 
order succeed program need take somewhat broader notion commitment taken mind valuable approaches castelfranchi von wright segerberg 
previous long taken broader interpretation rest literature singh 
pleasant side effect broader interpretation helps unifying important normative concepts 
follow program defer detailed discussion literature till section 
approach treats commitments class objects names asher 
naming enables self cross commitments 
think commitments conditions achieved actions 
way borrow tradition von wright continued philosophy segerberg common computer science research actions intentions previous singh 
conditions correspond high level actions 
conditions facilitates nesting commitments constructing higher order commitments defined easily 
agent commitments typically constrain act accordance 
commitment discharged desired condition obtained 
condition plain physical requirement requirement agent recognizes physical requirement satisfied 
avoid require discharge condition commitment evaluated objectively 
condition may explicitly involve beliefs mental states agents 
example possible commit making sky green making sky appear green different commitments different requirements satisfiability 
agents normally act accordance commitments 
commitments canceled 
settings applications agents multiagent systems useful inflexibility undesirable agents retain autonomy commitments 
commitments canceled arbitrarily subvert purpose 
challenge reconcile apparent tension requirements

commitment place relation involving proposition agents 
denote commitment context proposition debtor context group discharge condition commitment debtor agent committed agent receives commitment 
need direct beneficiary 
example japanese society obligations children beneficiaries debts parents 
assume treated beneficiary practical purposes 
revisit assumption section 
discharge condition condition committed 
commitment exists social context 
intuitively context includes norms conventions apply group commitment instantiated 
provides court appeals disputes debtor 
formally context group contains participating agents usually different roles 
groups general context groups particular class agents framework 
morse mentions passing public may treated plaintiff agent law 
idea group agents members basic 
group collectively delegates powers representative government typically group morse 
previous approaches commitments looked context sensitivity respect propositions define potential exception conditions 
example may obliged lending car drunk 
component context purely social 
component emphasize identification context group definition 

operations commitments descriptive ontology includes operations commitments 

create instantiates commitment typically performed consequence agent adopting role exercising social policy explained 

discharge satisfies commitment 
postulate discharge performed concurrently actions lead condition satisfied 
manner actions realize discharge condition generate discharge action goldman 

cancel revokes commitment subject cancelation clause commitment policies effect group 

release essentially eliminates commitment 
distinguished discharge cancel release mean success failure commitment lets debtor hook 
release action may performed context commitment 

delegate shifts role debtor agent context performed new debtor context 

assign transfers commitment context performed authorized context 
interestingly discharge typically performatives austin debtor context 
debtor unilaterally create cancel commitments performing right illocutions appropriate circumstances discharge commitment just saying 
reviewer correctly pointed commitment perform communicative act case discharged performative 
nesting actions case 
names operations predicates language 
cancel denotes proposition true precisely agent cancels commitment presupposes debtor 
spheres commitment postulate kinds agents named individuals named groups 
individuals unstructured groups constructed individuals groups specifying social structure 
naming groups allow membership change maintaining constant identity 
enables talk commitments relating agents 
set agents may form different groups potentially different structures 
sphere commitment group viewed conjunction roles concomitant commitments 

structure consider operations respect groups 
group may created agent may adopt role agent may reassign role agent may exit group 
operations may enabled voluntarily performed course 
example society agent assigned role automatically change role exit society death 
current applied multiagent systems similar 
course research societies defined terms agents playing different roles entering exiting roles reorganize societies 
example glaser study reinforcement learning reorganizing societies focus commitments se 

explicit versus implicit previously proposed structure group constraints interactions roles singh 
elaborate interactions somewhat differently 
distinguish main kinds commitments explicit implicit intimately related main kinds interactions termed strategic reactive singh 
explicit commitments explicitly represented agents implicit commitments 
consequently feature agents communications 
intuitively implicit commitments agents need articulate implicitly common knowledge mutually believed system 
important kind common knowledge real system having created communications chandy misra 
explicit interactions rely meaning explicit commitments communicating agents 
consider different classes illocutionary acts austin searle 
example ordinarily bring effect commitment speaker hearer 
commitment commitment speaker may 
strongly agree casta neda states act promising act type act process enactment law 
directives presuppose commitment hearer told order succeed lead specific commitment hearer 
commit speaker statement expressed 
speaker committed allowing relevant condition hold specifically release prior commitment speaker context group 
implicit interactions rely meaning implicit commitments 
implicit commitments correspond habits interaction lead observed arguably correct behavior system necessarily explicit representation reasoning interacting agents 
example commitment break line bus 
course fine line implicit explicit commitments implicit ones explicit discussed 
distinction conceptually practically important maintain 

flow role comes commitments

relating normative concepts commitments discuss relationships commitments understand traditional concepts occur literature 

traditional concepts refer back normative notions show mapped concepts introduced 
notions informal understood different ways different authors 
give example enumeration 


commitments framework powerful usual identify explicit commitment

ought 
believe classical approaches deontic logic express ought absolute terms unsuitable ought inherently contextual 
contrast analyze ought relativized context group ought corresponds commitment identified context group cancelation policy set false 

course represent traditional deontic ought approve 

flows 
interestingly canceled delegated assigned 
traditionally cancelation effected conditional dyadic obligations 
released context way context encodes exception conditions 
released lacks context 
definition respects castelfranchi syllogism commitment implies debtor ought discharge 

implicit order commitments relative context

apply uniformly members group 
implicitly created discharged operation applies overridden

convention custom relativized context implicit 
require conventions higher order lead lowerlevel commitments exercised resulting commitments may explicit implicit 
conv implicit order cancel false 
distinguish conventions typically lead lower order commitments 
example convention responding communicates 

collective commitment group agents may defined conjunction commitments individuals group context group members mutually believe impossible 
dunin keplicz study related notions summarizing previous 
mutual belief group holds means roughly member group believes believe arbitrary levels nesting fagin 
barwise compares alternative formulations mutual beliefs essentially similar purposes

multiagent systems research performed commitments social relations reasons space shall compare approach primarily castelfranchi considers multiagent system issues 
share intuitions castelfranchi emphasize different degrees 
particular agree limited autonomy agents dependence relations irreducibility general social concepts mental concepts normative nature roles 
castelfranchi requires stronger relationships concepts believe hold specific cases 
example requires committed condition goal mutually known debtor 
addition commit accepting commitment 
potential problems recursive commitments bottom appears strong cases 
example offer student research am committed soon mail letter decline come back designated interval claim 
case commitment holds mutual belief arise 
letter lost get hook context group aren aware commitment 
exhibiting letter prove commitment held 
castelfranchi requires debtor committed opposing complaints commitment canceled case required commitment may may social policy 
settings debtor default may expected accept complaints may 
castelfranchi notion implicit commitments different defines essentially defeasible commitments expectation potential debtor deny committed 
certainly useful notion capture social policies governing creation commitments hand accepting requests hand refraining reject 
implicit commitments acquired agents membership group 
commitments usually debate 
castelfranchi notion ought resembles traditional deontic logic relativized context 
exploit structure inherent agents organizations extent 
assign discussion cancelation commitments 
sichman develop theory interpreter agents perform social reasoning 
agents represent knowledge determine relative autonomy dependence various goals 
dependence leads joint plans achieving intended goals 
theory talk commitments se complementary approach 
levesque reduce commitments mutual beliefs suffering problems indicated 
specific approach canceling commitments joint intentions participating agents achieve mutual belief commitment 
jennings postulates conventions ways reason commitments 
teams requires minimum convention recalls levesque approach 

deontic logics traditional approaches tend focus single agent issues 
example von wright considers single agent nature best indirect agents interactions pp 

believe fundamentally limiting multiagent nature phenomenon studied 
traditionally largely result single agent focus deontic logics studied obligations directed considered commitments conditional obligations form 
example von wright defines commitment obligation conditional proposition form view performance commits agent performance prior defines commitment oq cited hilpinen 
segerberg considers commitments expressed locutions virtue commits agents propositions 
commitments case directed agents suppressed technical development 
abovementioned approaches commitment really conditional obligation 
segerberg definition commitments oq formalizes idea strict version prior idea 
obligations commitments related normative concepts carried implicitly single agent framework notable exceptions 
specifically descending tradition notion direction explicit 
original tradition morse gives summary tribute 
kanger formalize ideas 
development didn justice directedness original concepts 
obvious kanger pointed including krogh 
additional objections kanger approach 
defines ought dual right roughly analogous obligatory permissible uses formalize primitives 
duty means agent ought privilege means agent right negation power means agent right disability means agent ought negation pp 

acceptable 
formalizations power disability justice original meanings 
terms power disability altering legal relations 
defines operative facts legal rules suffice change legal relations 
kanger susceptible charge confusing operative facts alterations legal relations proper anticipated warned 
alchourr consider permissions lifting prohibitions issuing permissive norms pp 

believe notions closely related concepts 
lifting prohibition appears correspond removing duty identical granting privilege 
issuing permissive norm appears correspond granting immunity identical removing liability 
krogh propose formalization directed obligations highlighting interesting issues legal representation 
krogh reduce directed obligation conjunction bearer relativized obligation counter party relativized preference 
words debtor obliged action obliged prefer occurrence 
recalls idea castelfranchi accept commitment 
agree common uses commitments favor receiving commitment 
take question pragmatics semantics 
prefer commitment easily release commitment provided applicable release policy allows 
debtor cooperative settings carry commitment desire 
technically simpler elegant simpler definition semantics 
example krogh observe stronger definition directed obligation leads weaker definition permission 
repair definition insert requirement permission holds agent permission directed prefers permitted action performed 
question pragmatics surely permissions opposed worth talking 
appreciate distinction pragmatics semantics consider requirement propositions true believes false 
alternatively agent believes true agent believes false 
semantic requirements truth belief silly 
pragmatic requirements facts beliefs worth talking agents designers eminently reasonable 

von wright observes agent may err deviate path recover additional actions 
traditional deontic logics don permit actions leading contrary duty paradox ilk 
deviations corresponding recovery actions central theme approach 
explore connection social commitments rationality 
especially important cases conflict strength commitment may need modeled 
issues studied boman 
approach highlights interplay commitments structure multiagent systems

manner reconcile tension flexibility commitment autonomy coherence 
recognize need model theoretic semantics underpin proposed notion commitments
