automatic language independent induction gazetteer lists diana maynard bontcheva hamish cunningham dept computer science university sheffield sheffield uk dcs shef ac uk adaptation existing information extraction systems new languages domains focus current research progress hindered lack available resources enable developers get new system running fast 
previously shown set gazetteer lists vital role creation lists new language domain time consuming laborious 
demonstrate tool inducing gazetteer lists small set annotated corpora creating baseline system

major bottlenecks adapting systems new languages collection organisation new lexical resources 
languages large amount information available usually electronic form internet languages little information available 
systems fall main categories knowledge engineering approaches typically rule driven systems 
maynard machine learning approaches bikel 
approaches typically large gazetteer lists aid named entity recognition ne rule systems generally dependent machine learning systems 
lists contain geographical names cities countries names people especially names large organisations months year days week numbers previous experiments languages shown gazetteer lists keys success rule ne system particularly short term maynard recognition locations mikheev 
mean baseline scores achieved basic set components comprehensive gazetteer particularly terms recall 
depending language precision may suffer sophisticated methods example languages chinese names persons organisations highly ambiguous 
important uses gazetteer induction method describe 
enables rapid creation gazetteer lists training data time consuming process searching web relevant lists 
enables rapid creation baseline ne system methods tested evaluated 
experiments shown reuse named entities occurs extremely frequently especially texts belonging domain type example news articles source baseline achieved just set lists associated grammars palmer day 
provides method generating noisy training data small seed corpus cf morgan 
enables assessment ambiguity levels different entity types language 
useful deciding strategy ne recognition procedures specifically determining hand coded rules semantic grammar development 
important benchmarking purposes evaluation needs take account level difficulty task disambiguating entity types order provide useful result 

gazetteer list collector part improving language agility created gazetteer list collector freely available gate cunningham 
tool collects occurrences entities directly small set annotated training texts populates gazetteer lists entities 
entity types structure gazetteer lists defined necessary user 
lists collected semantic grammar find entities new texts 
list collector facility split person names collects individual tokens adds entire name list adds tokens list names surname separate entry 
grammar annotates persons require tokens consecutive person lookups 
way new person names recognised combining known name known surname training corpus 
single token matches unknown entity generated matched existing longer name component performs orthographic coreference named entities 
procedure entity types 
example parts organisation names combined different ways 

contextual information bootstrap lists list collector combined semantic tagger generate context words automatically 
lists collected automatically hindi suppose generate list persons occurring training corpus 
persons ambiguous entity types non entities especially languages chinese 
way improve precision sacrificing recall lists collector identify training corpus list verbs typically precede follow persons 
list generated way verbs frequency certain threshold collected verbs occur times person discarded 

lists collector identify relevant contextual information lists collector improve recognition entities enabling add constraints contextual information precedes follows candidate entities 
enables recognise new entities texts forms part development cycle add entries gazetteer lists 
way noisy training data rapidly created small seed corpus requiring large amount annotated data initially 
simple grammar rules collect examples entities training corpus information syntactic categories preceding context words 
analysis categories help write better patterns recognising entities 
example lists collector find definite indefinite articles precede person entities information write rule stipulating article preceding candidate person candidate valid person 
lexical information collecting examples verbs typically follow person entity 
verb candidate person increases likelihood candidate valid assign higher priority candidate context 
give detailed example procedure part chinese system created 

collector collector collects examples nouns precede follow person annotations training corpus 
grammar identifies nouns immediately preceding person annotations annotates nouns respectively 
annotations placed new annotation set called collected 
grammar followed gazetteer lists collector matches annotation types collected set populates gazetteer called lists def consisting lst lst respective relevant strings 
lists populated second grammar match patterns example form person person candidate person element lst preceding persons training corpus 
match candidate person annotated person 
second stage process place restrictions patterns permitting added list occur frequency depending corpus size size determined heuristically 
parameter set java file ideally better able set runtime parameter lists collector changed fly 
cycle reiterated automatically adding new persons way lists person lists collector process repeated 
addition collecting nouns context persons collected verbs occurring persons created appropriate rules lists

part program develop language processing tools resources unknown language restricted time span information extraction machine translation cross language information retrieval systems purely machine learning techniques required presence large scale lists may li mccallum 
created similar baseline systems chinese arabic measure chinese arabic just gazetteer lists simple grammars 
chinese arabic improved systems adding manually created lists creating additional tagging rules incorporating part speech information 
chinese implemented context collector described earlier 
adding information verbs preceding persons improved fmeasure experiments information adjectives method improved precision degrading recall
