minimal example take tree possible re orderings terminals involve crossing bracketing original tree allowed 
constraint gives way syntactic information translation may cases rigid 
part deal problem yamada knight flatten trees pre processing step collapsing nodes lexical head word 
allows example english subject verb object svo structure analyzed having vp node spanning verb object re ordered language arabic 
larger syntactic divergences trees may require relaxation constraint practice expect divergences frequent 
example nominal modifier language may show adverbial due choices information represented main verb syntactic correspondence sentences may break completely 
having flatter trees reorderings possible binary inversion transduction grammar trees fixing tree language generally stronger opposite effect dramatically restricting number permissible alignments 
tree string cloning order provide flexibility alignments cloning operation introduced tree string alignment gildea
