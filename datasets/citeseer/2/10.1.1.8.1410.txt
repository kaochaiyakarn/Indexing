approach finding named entities variant method cohen fan extracting information lists 
set named entities musicians musical groups query web search engine 
multiple named entities query retrieving web pages increased chances retrieving pages contained specified named entities opposed page containing words unrelated context ii contained lists included named entities 
kene tests knowledge approach named entity extraction works control page contents 
particular priori knowledge known named entities occur page 
compensate lack knowledge providing access large database known named entities see 
simple extend kene document representation include larger set features example lexical syntactic features 
larger feature set require testing rules database costly 
usually sufficient repetition lexical syntactic features single document supply sufficient amount training data situations probably worth added cost 
kene requires potential entity name document exactly match known entity name contained knowledge base 
restriction reasonable kene task identifying names authors organizations tend relatively consistently 
cohen fan vector space matching algorithm matching names musical groups accepting matches satisfied similarity threshold 
vector space matching people names short 
exact match simpler solution sufficient

inability generalize kene recognizes repeating structures table list elements identified markup tr li recognizes types repeating punctuation identified easily parse tree 
kene consider pair sibling subtrees possible repeating structure failed produce sufficiently general rules tables lists implicit

inconsistent structure generate approach relies consistent markup web documents markup inconsistently 
especially problem different sequences markup produced image 

named entity detection usually treated task finding language patterns consistent documents 
approach successful documents follow consistent style successful web documents information telegraphic tabular list form 
presents alternate approach document specific extraction rules generated tested 
priori constraints features document specific extraction rules focused document markup punctuation features maximize generality training data 
large database known named entities provided method testing validating candidate rules 
document specific generate test approach finding named entities meant replace existing approaches named entity detection 
clearly limited environments web xml documents considerable document structure 
expect useful primarily extracting named lists tables portions documents rely heavily visual structure fonts font characteristics 
experiments show approach finding named entities cases provide considerably higher recall conventional methods large drop precision 
experiments precision increased 
natural extension research reported combine identifinder corpus language pattern approach kene document specific markup pattern approach 
data fusion improves accuracy particularly methods involved comparable accuracy distinct forms evidence identifinder kene 
tighter integration strengthen approaches 
identifinder provide path adjusting kene validation thresholds dynamically example lowering approaches agree name raising disagree 
kene provide source relatively reliable training data tailoring identifinder language patterns individual documents 
general combination corpus specific language patterns document specific markup patterns offers interesting research possibilities improving named entity extraction
