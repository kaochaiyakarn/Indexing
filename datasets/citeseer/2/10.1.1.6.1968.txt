definition game goal developing structural framework explicitly define game identify elements commonly agreed games 
previous definitions games help identify candidates elements 
definitions word game dictionaries ref show variety uses activity engaged diversion amusement procedure strategy gaining physical mental competition conducted rules participants direct opposition activity undertaken regarded contest involving strategy struggle course period activity area expertise animals pursuit taken hunting 
game concepts parts meta structures games proper division larger contest number points necessary win organized athletics leading recursive definitions set rules governing game particular aspect phase play game sport 
large set definitions difficult base framework specific definition omit essential components 
definitions show emphasis activity involving interaction participants conflicting goals formalized ways achieving goals 
earliest formal study games excluding inspiration probability statistics field game theory 
describe games quantitative analyzed simplified complete concept game introduced seminal book theory games economic behavior ref 
simplified concept interest areas distinguishes game totality rules describe play particular instance game played

parlett stresses importance rules stating game rules define chris crawford ref defines game closed formal system subjectively represents subset reality 
closed indicates game require objects outside game formal denotes game explicit rules state rules need explicit 
addition definition element conflict deemed intrinsic element games safety barrier providing psychological experiences conflict danger excluding physical realizations comparing games forms representations reality crawford stresses interaction states highest complete form representation interactive representation 
games provide interactive element crucial factor appeal ref defines games interactive structure endogenous meaning requires players struggle goal 
endogenous meaning contributes observation game creates meanings 
objects game receive meaning regardless role play context game activity 
looking multiplayer games ref simple model game include components rules goals props tools define game concept immutable call game instances game progress include players

comparison computer code written create user interface omission users perceived activities severely restrict clarity description 
wished create model describe games activity 
study activities unusually confined fields ethnography anthropology rule activity games explicit requirements clear cut boundaries activities allowing study requiring methods fields 
say methods inform explicit formality games possible study activity detailed way observing people conducting activity making easier focus activity people 
distinction important games activities designed able treated objective material shaped designer 
looking survey definitions components identified placed different categories describe different aspects activity describe activity game play interactive representations describe meaning activity allowed activity rules endogenous meanings goals strategies describe unfolding activity moves choices implication physical logical objects signaling equipment maintain game state provide functionality randomizing score keeping time keeping 
twofold model mentioned earlier importance perceived interaction games led giving descriptions different interactions relations paramount role 
interaction part model game design patterns principle model earlier uses design patterns

turn implementation turn action pattern available means play game turn constitute game mechanics ref interaction centric structural framework games structural framework developed initial analysis terms describe games 
framework expanded refined examining relationship terms try structural framework describe games interaction games 
concepts framework basic building blocks games 
selected basis clearly identified archetypical games overlapping having natural relationship identified concepts 
claim concepts possible games claim model optimal framework describe games 
components may obvious trivial study realization games provide analysis game levels connected relations identified concepts 
structure relationship concepts categorized concepts groups 
reflecting views gaming activity activity voluntarily entered left temporal sequence events action activity consisting physical logical components classified groups holistic bounding temporal objective 
holistic components definition required activity game proceed explore concepts treating game holistic entity 
concepts help defining difference activities descriptions specific games linked players join game conditions game 
game instance trivial observation time game played previous times game played constitution players place game played external requirements limit playing time experience players 
game doesn change specifics single completion game play 
define game instance 
game session definition game instances similar ref exception include temporal aspect 
include games studied perspective objects primarily defined narrative structure perspectives example game theoretical game strategy analyses expression culture 
time clearly critical part play describing games required allow interaction games especially computer games narrative structure 
define game session activity defined time spent playing game instance 
actual time game session spans varies greatly games 
case rock scissors couple seconds board games couple hours massively multiplayer online games game sessions servers shut due lost interest game players 
avoid von neumann morgenstern ref term play define similar game session due avoid confusion uses play play session 
play session completion game session divided distinct periods game play activity play sessions typically shorter periods time time 
example complex tabletop board games require hours complete find required time players usually divide time play sessions lasting couple hours played period weeks 
play sessions tightly coupled players tied players 
play mail games example separate play sessions player related requirement synchronize game play 
massively multiplayer online games multitude play sessions ongoing simultaneously start merge separate disappear depending players activities 
bounding components holistic components describe activity game play relates activities 
bounding components components define required redefine activity place 
rules rules dictate flow game 
framework rules embedded component rules govern game elements behave player actions 
rules endogenous explicitly stated part game exogenous formally inscribed enforceable game 
typical examples exogenous rules called house rules regarding computer games rules regarding conditions 
breaking rules openly game activities requires reformulation exclude rule breaker 
doing secretly cheating requires players detect faulty behavior 
stated ref cheater activity playing impossible person refused follow rules 
modes play games typically structured different sections phases turns interface available actions information player changes dramatically 
call different modes play seen constructs define boundaries activities larger activity playing particular game 
typical examples switches mode play transition map view inventory screen computer role playing game turn chess 
modes play game depends level detail define states game 
chess said modes players turn players turn combinations locations pieces 
goals subgoals aim players plans actions game complete goals vary players 
player goal related 
example games goals progress completing goal difficult complete goal 
note games example space invader pacman allow players goal winner parlett sense game winning condition 
similar rules goals endogenous exogenous 
typical kind goal games endogenous opponent king occupy largest amount game area reach certain point highest score 
exogenous goals goals brought game activity give meaning increase motivation playing 
examples games require exogenous goals role playing games computer simulation games sims sim city 
game poker said exogenous endogenous goals due fact tokens play typically exogenous monetary value 
goals complex games split smaller subgoals structure game play levels narrative structures completion goal easier achieve acquire new powers tools reducing opposition 
existence subgoals goal predefined game created implicitly players 
case creation subgoals ease completion main goal seen indication player skill 
temporal components temporal components record activity playing game 
components define larger game play activity temporally separated activities boundaries activities 
actions players change game state performing actions 
actions available player typically change current game state mode play 
depending game model actions continuous temporally defined measure game time discrete temporally defined relation actions 
game time defined differentiable comparing actions different game sessions game 
chess discrete actions outcome change games played exactly moves take different amount time play 
computer racing game continuous actions difference time complete game change outcome 
generally games allow player perform actions times continuous actions 
updating game state actions communicate values game state player strategy 
communication done direct inverted signaling addition variant indirect trying convey correct information implicitly 
special case actions update game state handled game system actions compared operation command computer assembly languages 
typical messaging players online games actions affect game state allow players spread information 
events events discrete points game play game state changes 
typical events occur due completion players actions case discrete actions connected events 
games trigger events player intervention commonly computer games possible mechanical means 
definition event specifically state game state changes 
rolling die monopoly triggers state change player moves piece new place event specify place 
determining similar events change known priori controlled evaluation functions described 
closures completion goal subgoal results closure change game state clearly perceived semantically meaningful transition players typically switch mode play 
closures occur players clearly reached point goal longer achievable deterministic game events emptying drawing stack card game completion bidding round poker 
conditions conditions specify game state closure occurs 
paramount condition game course defined game session ends 
conditions usually accompanied evaluation function 
conditions necessarily isomorphic mapping goals game 
typical examples case role playing games online person games 
evaluation functions evaluation function determines outcome event 
typical evaluation function determine winner game game session 
similar evaluation function known winning condition condition determines winner causes game session 
closures cause evaluation functions determined turn cause new closures 
scoring mechanisms games examples evaluation functions 
objective components category includes concepts describe game temporal contextual aspects consideration looking activity 
players important observation concerning players necessarily human beings 
define players logical components perform actions interpreted having strategies goals enter leave game 
example single player strategy game opponents controlled computer viewed players 
normally player manifested game specific game component avatar lara croft series 
apparent online board game players may little identity actions performed name 
interface player access game interface 
game components represented interface tokens come different types forms wide variety different modes manipulation depending game type 
board games counters pieces boards card games obviously cards tokens digital games digital representation similar tokens audiovisual look manipulated keyboard mouse accessories 
words look feel game specified interface 
game components game components physical logical components games help maintain inform players current game state 
normally attributes contain relationships game components creating game component configurations 
relationships game components 
state game totality game component configuration time 
changing game component means attributes changes 
exemplify game components function game 
tokens represent players avatars 
tokens define actions available players avatars chess pieces cards 
tokens collection tokens enable evaluation functions dice cards stacks shuffled 
tokens represent non player agents ghosts pac man 
physical logical elements spatially describe game space chess squares cards emergent city walls rivers road 
components representing specific values game state time left counter strike time limited chess games 
components game convey intra game information signs 
components game convey extra game information rules game 
non interactive components define boundaries game space convey theme atmosphere graphics audio backgrounds textures computer games game boards list non exhaustive overlapping example dice monopoly defines action available roll determine random amount steps move 
components attribute structures color value hit points level action structures move press turn connected individual relationships player 
attribute relationships span known unknown scale action relationships spanned dimensions known unknown permitted prohibited 
unknown attribute relationships common games evaluation function depending attributes game components 
example poker game play imperfect information available players hand 
chess white player known prohibited action relationship black player pieces possible actions performed pieces known immutable 
components change mutable immutable course game component actions requirements depend elements game possible move chess 
similarly stratego starts actions player pieces unknown prohibited 
manipulation components may possible proxy player needs bombs order clear
