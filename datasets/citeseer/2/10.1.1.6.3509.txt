model uncertain contexts section discuss basic context model probabilistic extension translation rdf graph bayesian network 

ontology model initial concept modeling context information introduced 
model contexts represented order predicate calculus 
basic model form predicate subject value subject set subject names person location object 
predicate set predicate names located status value set values subjects living room open close empty example location john bathroom john located bathroom temperature kitchen temperature kitchen status door open door status open structures properties context predicates described ontology may include descriptions classes properties instances 
ontology written owl collection rdf triples statement form subject verb object subject object ontology objects individuals predicate property relation defined ontology 

probabilistic extension basic model representing uncertain contexts extend basic context model incorporating probabilistic information 
form prob predicate subject value probability measurement takes value 
extended model applies type contexts sensed contexts defined contexts derived contexts 
example case derived context prob status john sleeping means probability john currently sleeping 

probability annotated ontology ontology language owl provide support probabilistic information need augment capability allow additional probabilistic markups 
encode probability context ontology define owl classes 
classes object property datatype property class additional object property 
definitions enable specify arbitrary probability 
example assuming represent context predicates form rdf triples prior probability defined instance class shown conditional probability defined instance class shown 

owl expressions probabilistic markups proposed encoding scheme influenced scheme allows markup arbitrary conditional probability example 

bayesian networks structural translation bayesian network bn directed acyclic graph dag node corresponds random variable xi directed arcs represent influential relationships random variables 
uncertainty causal relationship represented locally conditional probability table xi pa xi associated node xi pa xi parent set xi 
conditional independence assumption joint probability distribution

apply bn enable learning casual dependencies various context events obtaining probability distributions 
model node take corresponds context predicate directed arcs nodes represent causal relationships contexts 
giving conditional probability table able compute probability distribution bn 
constructing bayesian network context information involves identifying causal dependencies different context events translating context ontology bn 
dependency relation exists various types context information 
dependency captures existence reliance property associated entity 
markup dependency information ontology owl introduce additional property elements rdfs dependson captures dependency relationship properties associated datatypes objects
