distributed configuration management java world wide web james hunt frank jurgen reuter walter tichy university karlsruhe karlsruhe germany 
java revolution network computing 
certainly machine operating system independent applets internet promised jazz web surfing advantage distributed computing authors encountered substantial problems implementing distributed revision control system called wwrc passive web browsers 
java offer solutions problems 
authors developed successor wwrc written java 
extends concepts wwrc distributed configuration management cme new configuration management api 
demonstrates design difficulties encountered wwrc solved java 
furthermore offers test bed configuration management paradigm called template regulated alternative development 
flurry development pertaining internet years 
innovations led surge interest internet world wide web www java 
www provides means access information easily net 
java allows programs run net 
significantly easier distribute information net just years ago 
authors investigating application www software development similar period time 
systems exist distributed revision control clearcase www offers lightweight alternative systems 
authors developed www revision control system called world wide revision control wwrc 
wwrc provides revision control www 
order access archive remote machine need install web browser netscape tm small helper application 
wwrc uses basic authentication scheme user need system access connection server 
wwrc demonstrates www distribution base software management tools 
authors addresses jjh tichy ira uka de respectively prototypes wwrc designed prove concept 
illuminates strength web tools weaknesses 
authors demonstrate weaknesses eliminated 
experience wwrc authors built new system called world wide configuration management 
combining strengths www java tm new configuration management api authors show practical distributed software development tools produced independent underlying hardware operating system 
specifically provides distributed configuration management standard java capable web browsers 
new kid block problems concept wwrc sound implementation significant drawbacks 
wwrc written java widely available relied html describe entire user interface 
addition test concept quickly server wwrc written inetd client 
furthermore scope limited revision control supporting full configuration management 
decisions proved restrictive 
static format dynamic information html designed display relatively static data 
hand wwrc server provide dynamic data time user request affects view wwrc 
server generating new html page request 
constant interaction browser server negative side effects 
response server required action system unusable connections long round trip times server 
second user browser fills pages invalid due subsequent operations 
normal forward backward commands browser virtually useless 
solve second problem page time stamp scheme needed implemented prevent user accessing pages invalid 
passive interface browser act response user requests sending command server helper application needed assist browser file transfer check check 
netscape facility upload download files server 
required user manually specify file read file written 
additional processing done 
helper application multi part message protocol needed abused order start helper able give response user 
server provide response request browser sub message start helper application second notify user result returned helper application server 
means second part sent helper finished 
extra delay inserted parts message 
delay lead timeouts slow connections large data transfers 
authors full control server alleviate problems web browsers designed accept unsolicited messages web servers 
platform dependent wwrc server implemented inetd client 
inetd implementation quick implement main deficiencies portability efficiency coordination 
inetd unix specific server need modified run operating systems 
addition new server process spawned request response time relatively long 
separate processes request difficult communicate different instances server 
communication essential coordination helper application browser 
request interacts server connection different process 
information generated browser server pair needed helper server pair vice versa 
simple slow file interprocess communication scheme implemented 
server succeeded demonstrating feasibility general approach unsatisfactory just prototype 
revision control vs configuration management limitation wwrc tools hand www 
wwrc supports just distributed revision control configuration management 
decision arose fact authors developed appropriate api revision control form revision control engine rce extended configuration management 
browser view shortcomings wwrc solved help java extension rce called configuration management engine cme 
combining cme new java server browser side applet goes long way solving shortcomings wwrc 
changes just internal 
immediately apparent user 
diving details implementation quick overview user interface order 
wwrc page sees login page 
relies basic authentication scheme provided validating users

manipulating project similarity ends 
entire paradigm different wwrc 
user perspective main concepts extend cme rce extension wwrc 
cme defines projects working sets organize files larger context 
concepts provide structure organizing archives rce single repository 
password verification user encounters project selection page depicted 
page displayed browser 
rest interaction occurs dialog boxes generated applet accompanies project selection page 
user confronted choosing project 
project collection files belong implementing documenting particular product system 
cme uses tree structure help organize various parts project just user organize personal workspace 
user selected project rce example dialog appears 
upper left corner dialog field selecting working set 
example depicted 
working sets defined users administrators provide functions 
define subsets project set check check policies 
filtering done listing files subdirectories interest 
entry policy selection go 
user select list working sets entire project 
contents project selected working set listed large selection box left hand side dialog 
right hand side gives summary information file revision selected left 
user browse project look individual revisions select working set mark elements interest 
working set operations available menu top dialog 
working set operations include check check get read 
edit contents project working sets project operations 
case check selects working set subset thereof dialog 
simply selects check option file pull menu 
new dialog appears specify information versions checked state new alias commentary describing intent check 
comment amended extended check time 
important keep mind main operations performed groups files entire project working set subset thereof 
operations implemented analogously 
dialogs act local application simply accesses remote store 
project manipulation dialog remains active user presses close button browser exited 
means user free browser things 
scenes user interface situation bit complicated 
combination cme java powerful cleaner wwrc stumbling blocks 
difficult problem remains inability communicate directly applet local store 
interaction diverted server helper application client machine 
despite cme java brought important capabilities 
rce distributed configuration management check check interface rce sufficient configuration management system 
reason authors developed cme api complement rce 
rce supports file archiving ability manage alternate lines development branching 
addition rce full api templates tracking progress 
cme extends rce providing means maintaining collection files project 
cme leverages template concept rce offer means managing alternative lines development template regulated alternative development trad 
structure cme provides basic structures configuration management 
project elements stored hierarchic list 
working sets provided manage interesting subsets list 
access control lists available support user roles 
element names managed internal numeric registry managing renaming 
convenient developers project arrange elements project hierarchic structure 
cme maintains elements project list hierarchic names element 
structure seen section 
checking project archives cme fills directory subtree user area reflects hierarchy project name space 
seldom needs entire project time 
mentioned cme provides working sets simplify manipulation just elements project pertinent 
operation perform entire project performed working set 
access set levels configuration entire project individual archives 
level access read write administrative 
access rules rce 
cme extends rules configuration 
help organize structures cme assigns unique number element project list 
number internal unique identifier project element 
user see number 
number stays cme supports user mapping particular user application requires view 
node archive regardless node archive moved renamed 
simple mechanism project versioned 
files appear previous version project matter called current version project 
maintaining directory old files system locate files obsolete current version project 
templates cme main task coordinate states archives files project 
task interesting face multiple developers working data 
main strategies handling problem 
reserved check 
locks prevent person working file simultaneously 
second check 
free access allowed revisions proviso finished wins slot main branch 
making rce templates cme go models provide flexible policy coordinating check check 
basic templates user checks file rce archive empty revision added archive 
revision holds information checked file happened file system deposited 
second user check revision template start branch 
information contained template ensure user checks file goes correct template 
system record checked 
trad template regulated alternative development authors wished provide mechanism private check pointing cme 
maintaining version control code ready shared users 
result system distinguishes public revisions private revisions 
public revisions released developers 
private revisions accessible single user 
private revision forms alternate main line development users 
ensure released revisions project consistent 
prevent user alternate accidentally support policies promoting revisions back main line development 
trad designed just 
trad takes rce template mechanism step 
user receives branch checks file 
revision checked revision public branch place holder template created public branch user branch created private template 
user login name tag template 
users continue private branch satisfied code ready released developers 
point system template jjh jjh wft wft wft jjh fig 

parallel development wft wft jjh jjh jjh jjh fig 

merge resolution information determine user take place holder template public branch 
system generate necessary merge 
example users wft jjh working private branches 
template place holder 
user respective template wft jjh 
state wft decides check changes back main branch 
parent place holder template ancestor template wft system knows template checked place holder template safely 
jjh tries thing system notices safe check revision place holder template 
parent place holder ancestor template jjh 
order remedy situation system spawns new branch jjh jjh fills merge jjh 
reviewed tested position check version public branch 
important parent new branch conflict testing works properly 
merge links set back wft jjh back jjh capture merge relationships 
looking entire project cme prevent mismatched alternates appearing main branch examined private branch 
criteria promoting alternative line development met elements project promotion take place 
piecewise promotion changes file require changes file 
important versions user tested put main branch just 
course files changed bearing promotion 
point insure collection current revisions public branch forms consistent tested set 
templates system place new revisions back proper place tree 
furthermore system determine merges bring developer date 
important note trad allows different promotion merging policies implemented 
insure proposed promotion main branch allowed files involved check main branch occur prioritize promotion private branches back main branch 
user may set check conditions regards users 
example user low priority allowed promote variant main branch user default revision checked 
useful difficult changes checked merging development streams 
opposite condition highest priority check useful particular change 
exactly handled topic ongoing research 
time threads java server order provide portable standard basis server wwrc needed rewritten 
embarking writing totally new server authors examined available 
servers available customizable appeared sufficiently flexible support 
different approach taken writing server 
multi threaded server written java 
new server solves problems wwrc server 
responsive wwrc server 
threads communicate blackboard 
server java fully portable 
things differentiate server web servers 
built classes configuration management hierarchic configuration mechanism 
rce cme apis available server java native methods 
internally wrapped classes archive revision project working set apis support object linking provide fast api handles wrapper classes 
hierarchic configuration mechanism server enables control directory access case case basis 
attribute inheritance keeps simple cases simple 
structure allows fine control access server disk store 
server act web server server sacrificing security 
crowd browser applet helper java applets browser world difference client side 
entire interaction server takes place similar server called jigsaw basis released somewhat earlier 
web pages login page project selection page 
information obtained java dialogs 
helper application needed support check check selection files added archive protocol cleaner 
client interface behaves expect gui behave 
independent web pages interface page time stamping necessary 
browser forward back commands longer cause inconsistency 
fact project selected page web sites 
applet controls interaction user 
server need contacted information needed revision transfer take place 
applet caches state information possible 
applet win way 
initiate start helper application contact server time 
means server need abuse semantics multi part messages order start helper application refresh user view completion 
multi part message hack applet automatically time waiting completion update 
helper application needed writing secure way give applet access local file system 
helper application single biggest impediment left 
secure local access available protocol simpler 
mentioned cases helper application needed check check adding new file project 
cases depicted figures respectively 
protocol case essentially 
varies data transmitted helper application 
check point view protocol check simpler case 
helper needed send files server check delete files local store check successful need process additional information server 
just wait completion 
difficult aspect protocol getting helper application started proper information 
difficulty lies fact helper application interface designed browser call program display information server interpret 
means message server start helper application 
problem applet needs drive request user input receives 
path quite circuitous involve server 
user selected working set checked project list applet needs start helper application collect files send server 
applet send show document request browser url requesting check 
message helper application written java portability 
ack reply get post server applet helper show browser ack post fig 

check protocol ack ack reply post reply get post server show helper browser applet fig 

check protocol instruct browser request server initiate helper application 
way get server send packet information browser causing start helper application 
message contains unique token identify request coordinating various connections needed carry 
response show document applet browser performs get server special url 
starts server thread sole task send helper application start request back browser thread exits 
content type set special value causes browser start helper application 
helper application collects files checked server posts server 
starts server thread 
server finished processing files sends acknowledgment helper application 
helper application necessary clean exits 
soon applet finished sending show document browser posts completion notification request list files checked afore mentioned token server 
starts new thread server starts described 
thread sole task collecting information threads notify applet completion status processing finished 
third thread exits sends message thread indicating finished 
thread updates applet status exits 
check check similar points 
helper application needed file operations 
complication comes fact main information flow direction 
theoretically thread check send files helper reply helpers post message 
wait acknowledge message helper application sending confirmation thread 
slow 
thread started applet checks requested material 
passes information thread started second check request helper application 
think prefetch third thread

change propagation paradigm tool adele system central archive access remote procedure calls 
shares central archive approach far user communicates central store network 
differs methods level support required 
user need access server machine access archives client side lightweight 
authors system uses java world wide web provide portable distributed configuration management system 
system experience wwrc improves system significantly 
system fully conforms specification 
ensures better interoperability enables system take advantage existing facilities invocation 
inclusion cme full configuration management system 
cme prototype stage provides basic requirements configuration management api 
cme uses trad paradigm resolving conflicts developers working project support parallel development 
provides means experimenting policies personal variants 
java applets enables system robust responsive 
allows server provide better feedback breaking semantics 
avoid having helper application altogether 
unfortunately possible 
browsers forbid applets access local disk store 
result communication local store applet carried server 
expect browser policy allow access local store authorized applets applets authorized urls 
signed applets provide means solving shortcoming 
roundabout communication path accessing local store biggest impediment truly efficient implementation 
reason performance acceptable compete distribution techniques performance basis 
setup time operations check check high 
applications require lightweight access central archive provides viable alternative traditional approaches 
main directions 
develop system take better advantage network design proxy server share archives main server 
second expand concepts cme provide process control including support build management external tools
