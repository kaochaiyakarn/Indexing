efficient broadcast time stamping extended josh benaloh clarkson university michael de mare clarkson university april efficient broadcast time stamping extended authenticated synchronous broadcast model task time stamping digital documents presents problems 
simply practical assume participants record store documents creation times verified 
presents time space efficient method accumulation time stamped documents 
question arises claimant convince honest participant time document posted 
problem time stamping documents long believed open shut 
unpredictable stream data sun spot activity digitally sign document sufficiently long portion stream time signing 
document revealed plain signed time relevant portion stream generated 
method commonly hostage photographs hostage shown holding newspaper order demonstrate hostage alive date newspaper printed 
equally plain researchers problem showing event occurred certain time impossible involve requiring prover forget information 
photograph hostage holding provide compelling evidence hostage held year 
haber stornetta show reasonable model forward backward time stamping possible 
offer solutions require central authority substantial cooperation participating agents validate time stamp substantial cooperation post document substantial amount storage 
presents solution time stamping problem required 
simplicity communication model authenticated broadcast channels 
channels simulated variety easily realizable methods see example authenticated broadcast channels serve useful communication primitive develop interactive protocols 
model somewhat different haber stornetta 
assume time stamping protocols run fixed time periods rounds allow claimant efficiently demonstrate challenger round document stamped 
haber stornetta guarantee protocols pair documents determine stamped 
exchange loss fine discrimination able eliminate requirements substantially improve efficiency 
actual best choice length round dependent level usage system 
hour day week suitable time period 
shortening period increases complexity 
unreasonable example claims submitted patent office day regarded having arrived 
note document stamped digitally signed encrypted hashed authors names revealed time possible dishonest agent duplicate contents document send rival claim day 
definitions giving formal definition time stamping 
definition time stamping system security parameter consists set participants fp synchronous communicating processes triple protocols 
stamping protocol proceeds rounds allows participant post messages round 
claimant protocol subsequent time run participant posted message convince honest participant running verification protocol round message posted 
polynomial dishonest participants running substitute protocols probability falsely convince honest verifier running protocol message submitted round 
definition broad allows model communication require symmetry protocols protocol may require participant index determine action take 
protocols may require interaction 
model attempts capture notion time stamping continually performed protocol necessary demonstrate timestamp time protocols provided allow claimant demonstrate time stamp verifier 
seen section definition admits simplistic solutions time stamping problem 
simplistic solutions prove inefficient slightly sophisticated protocol satisfies definition gives reasonable efficiency 
fundamental tools time stamping systems way hash functions 
definition family way hash functions infinite set functions fh functions properties 
exists polynomial integer computable time jxj 
polynomial exists probabilistic polynomial time algorithm sufficiently large find probability greater chosen uniformly elements jxj applying way hash function document computationally infeasible find document hashes value 
reason haber stornetta utilize way hash functions schemes 
follows definition family way hash functions family way functions 
naor yung shown way hash functions exists way functions exist turn exist secure signature schemes exist 
shown ill existence way functions equivalent existence secure pseudo random number generators 
simple broadcast protocols simple protocols satisfy definition desirable require excessive storage cooperation 
briefly describe completeness 
remember protocol simply requires participant broadcast encrypted form document wants time stamped 
participants simply remember posted documents time posting 
verify time stamp honest participant simply go back archives find document check posting time verify document posted claimed time 
case stamping protocol simply requires broadcast message stamped recording broadcasts claimant protocol null verification protocol simply requires look local memory 
simple machine post document time space required unacceptable machine permanently store document 
chaining system quite storage efficient chaining oneway hash functions manner similar method proposed haber stornetta 
participant wants time stamp message computes hash message posted hash value 
new hash value posted possible 
participant need remember message posts message hash previous document 
current hash value saved participants 
describes protocol 
verify time stamp participant may enlist help participants 
entire chain hash values claimed message hash value known verifier necessary current hash re hashed verified 
protocol requires claimant obtain participants intervening messages protocol requires verifier re hash message sequence sure match obtained 
approach storage efficient requiring participant remember documents hash value document posts 
problem requires high degree cooperation participant refusing produce documents destroy entire verification process 
clearly unacceptable system function participants hostile 
flat system rounds rounds construct scheme require extensive cooperation storage participants substantial times don documents post 
round participants broadcast documents stamped 
documents hashed previous round timestamp produce single value serves current round time stamp 
protocol requires participant produced document round remember documents round 
participants submitting documents round remember round time stamp 
demonstrate document properly stamped claimant protocol requires participant produce documents submitted round 
verification protocol simply requires participant compute hash messages check matches round time stamp 
cost storage levied participants producing documents tagged better remember model cooperation required chaining model 
scheme assumes associativity willing assume existence way hash functions associative easy flat scheme extremely space efficient 
denote document set submitted participant round 
process hashing document sets participants completed starting previous round time stamp forming gamma resulting hash value current round time stamp 
clear reproduce round time stamp hash includes participant need save gamma saving 
result small constant factor improvement storage requirements 
way hash function associative simply store gamma value represents cumulative hash document sets order application hashes matter round time stamp equal gamma regardless fact commutative necessary store value cumulative hash document sets case number fixed sized hash values stored participant order demonstrate validity documents round constant 
unfortunately scheme efficient provides simple verification assumption associative way hash function may unrealistic 
section describes scheme quite efficient depends existence way hash functions turn known equivalent existence arbitrary way functions 
hierarchical system proceeds rounds describe time stamping system time space efficient depends assumption way functions way hash functions exist 
method similar flat system previous section structuring things hierarchically possible eliminate bulk storage requirements 
auxiliary storage required machine scheme log round number participants 
idea structure things time stamp round depends time stamp previous round documents submitted current round 
difference longer necessary store round documents prove document time stamp 
participants time stamping system organized hierarchy participant placed leaf complete ary tree 
stamping protocol 
round participant gathers documents wishes stamp round hashes previous round hash value gamma produce hash value participant broadcasts 
defaults substituted hash values participants messages stamp round 

hash values associated leaves ary tree participants organized 
default values leaves participant associated 
value associated internal node tree hash values children 
value associated root denoted value called time stamp round 

independently computes broadcast information fixed defaults tree values round values associated ancestors participant leaf ancestors siblings saved 
claimant protocol demonstrate document submitted round 
claimant produces documents submitted round note document may encrypted pre hashed revealing document necessarily reveal contents 

claimant produces hash values ancestors siblings stored round verification protocol verify claim document stamped round 
verifier checks documents released claimant time stamp gamma round gamma hash value supplied claimant 

verifier checks hash values produced claimant starting tree root ultimately hash time stamp round hashes match verifier accepts time stamped document 
time stamp rejected 
note essential verifier store time stamp round 
verifier know time stamp round claimant provide information chain time stamps consecutive rounds 
continued round verifier knows time stamp 
current round time stamp stored participants 
turns protocols described branching factor hierarchy optimal 
slightly refined set protocols participants save hash values ancestor nodes save ancestors siblings values relevant document hash sufficient reconstruct missing values yield optimal branching factor

value document dishonest participants want falsely stamp derived hash value dependent value 
case fixed value chosen yield collision 
note way hash function preclude possibility finding colliding pairs inputs 
requires collision input 
may derived document chosen facilitate collisions distribution value derived constant number iterations way hash function far uniform 
implies efficient algorithm produce collision repeated hash input 
words algorithm take way hash functions value find value
