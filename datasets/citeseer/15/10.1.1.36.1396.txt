problem context traditional information retrieval systems cornerstone information access internet virtually settings people access information computer 
systems process requests form query consisting natural language search terms provide user list links documents system determines relevant query

users need express request terms search terms

unfortunately information retrieval systems attempted understand represent concepts expressed documents index requests process divorced critical information necessary understand 
traditional information systems isolated context request occurs 
information requests occur reason reason grounds request contextual information necessary interpret process

section outlines previous area 

previous efforts establishing context information requests previous efforts establishing context information access classified categories relevance feedback information retrieval systems user profiles approaches implicit explicit techniques word sense disambiguation knowledge engineering approaches 
relevance feedback technique acquiring relevance feedback narrow search space seen method discerning context 
systems support relevance feedback user begins standard query evaluates results returned usually judging result relevant relevant 
evidence gathered result user evaluation modify original query adding positive negative search terms 
vector space model information retrieval queries documents represented vectors high dimensional space dimension represents word word stem 
query vector space documents measure minimized retrieved measure distance usually cosine angle vectors dot product vectors space normalized 
user performs judgment document query modified adding judged document terms 
scalar positive value judged relevant negative value judged irrelevant 
commercial search engines currently support relevance feedback 
study excite major search engines support relevance feedback time showed users hardly took advantage 
unfortunately different study system showed users generally dissatisfied results suggesting reason users relevance feedback information initial short query words sufficient retrieve relevant results 
addition study showed search sessions typically include query refinements addition deletion terms suggesting users may willing spend time effort necessary manual automated refinement techniques 
results argue strongly methods automatically perform refinement front requiring explicit user intervention 
user profiles efforts building user profiles representing user interests seen method gathering contextual information 
user profiles collected gathering terms rating documents relevance feedback described 
relevance feedback techniques information gathered profile persists retrieval sessions may automatically added user query 
systems machine learning algorithms induce classifier documents training examples gathered result user rating documents 
systems typically learn binary text classifiers classify documents documents relevant irrelevant 
systems learn na bayes support vector machine classifiers common see survey 
systems letizia implicit feedback form user interactions bookmarking page learn user profile 
letizia uses user profile perform lookahead search locus page user currently viewing recommend links accessible current page 
implicit feedback techniques particularly promising results study discussed suggest users unwilling provide explicit feedback 
unfortunately kinds systems disadvantage address issue communicating general interests information systems lack access user active goals view current goals user important long term interests especially providing justin time access relevant information 
word sense disambiguation systems attempt reduce ambiguity requiring explicit word sense disambiguation part user popularity information intrinsic structure hypertext documents 
unfortunately disambiguation word senses addresses part problem discerning context isolated setting 
addition requiring user perform explicit disambiguation may fall prey user interaction problems encountered explicit relevance feedback techniques 
users may unwilling choose multiple senses 
systems text index documents advantage require intervention part user limited fact typically popularity metric ordering results fall short analysis context deeper 
example google 
system uses text links index documents processes query gas plasma displays return long list documents blood plasma system include word plasma frequently point documents discuss blood plasma
