role eye gaze conversation broad body literature role eye gaze human interactions 
literature investigates questions people tend look speaking versus listening eye gaze regulate turn conversations 
studies focus eye gaze patterns face face conversations 
best single source gaze mutual gaze argyle cook bring individual studies common context 
results studies suggest eye gaze helps control flow turn conversations 
example person listening uses eye gaze indicate paying attention person speaking uses track listener engaged conversation 
eye gaze means create subtle breaks conversation allow change speaker 
kendon reports typical pattern interaction people converse consists listener maintaining fairly long gazes speaker interrupted short glances away 
contrast speaker longer gazes away listener shorter gazes listener 
addition particularly longer utterances seconds kendon speaker tends look listener finish utterance 
hypothesized serves mechanism hand floor listener 
usefulness observation application depend knowledge words avatar pre scripted action speech generated fly 
supports kendon results 
addition report mutual break pattern occurs turns speech 
authors define mutual break pattern speaker looks listener utterance comes close 
gaze momentarily mutual listener breaks mutual gaze begins speak 
furthermore verbal exchanges mutual hold took place listener maintained gaze short time speak 
mutual gaze occurs individuals look simultaneously eyes 
argyle discusses findings indicate length mutual gaze varies depending age longer adults young children gender longer women men distance speakers mutual gaze longer widely separated conversants culture adults western cultures mutual gaze tends short mean duration seconds
