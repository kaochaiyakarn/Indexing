means going binary decision scheme 
dealing binary hypothesis testing trivial understand decision module kinds errors 
applied problem verification identity person errors called false rejection fr actual client rejected impostor false acceptance fa actual impostor accepted client 
performances speaker verification system usually terms global error rates computed tests false rejection rate frr false acceptance rate far 
error rates defined follows frr number false rejections number client accesses far number false acceptances number impostor accesses perfect identity verification far frr practice unachievable 
shown study binary hypothesis testing far frr reduced arbitrary small value changing decision threshold drawback increasing 
unique measure obtained combining errors total error rate ter ter number fa number fr total number accesses care taken unique measures
