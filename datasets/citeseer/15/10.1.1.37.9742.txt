firstly modal logics traditionally defined terms classical logic functional programming corresponds intuitionistic logic 
secondly providing sort formulation axiomatic difficult proposed modal logics

exclusively terms kripke style models 
kripke semantics works intuitionistic modal logic separate accessibility relations choices appear deciding relations interact 
approach somewhat different 
models guide prefer categorical ones 
reason situation kripke semantics interested modelling just provability proofs 
approach termed categorical proof theory simply categorical logic 
category theory provides language describing abstractly required model precisely extra structures needed arbitrary category model logic 
checking candidate concrete model simplifies checking satisfies definition 
soundness example need checked definition 
concrete models satisfy definition sound 
categorical semantics provide general simple formulation model 
interest case traditional models lack generality quite complicated describe 
particular categorical semantics enable model powerful logics impredicative type theories intuitionistic higher order logic
