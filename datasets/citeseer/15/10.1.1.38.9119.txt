researchers situated cognition constructivist cognitive science argued representations play important role traditionally assigned 
researchers neural networks general reject symbolic representations favor subsymbolic non symbolic processing 
resulting strong debate vs non 
attempt clarify issues 
classical ai physical structures acting representations usually called symbols processes operating called symbol processing operations 
addition symbol processing subjected strong constraints symbols need defined formal system symbolic expressions need strict correspondence objects represent sense tarskian truth theoretic semantics 
operations performed obtain predictive power truth preserving 
restrictions representations obviously narrow
