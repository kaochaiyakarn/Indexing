spatially bounded perform operation restricted focus maintaining global context 
overlap various compositional semantics performed controlled 
boolean queries composition mechanism displaying data scatterplot format set lenses create dynamic queries data 
lens acts filter screens attribute data 
slider filter controls threshold numeric data

lenses overlap operations combined 
provides clean model building complex queries 
physical merely conceptual composition multiple sliders appeals existing user intuitions spatial overlaps imply composition shown venn diagrams color circles 
create boolean queries composing magic lens filters need provide way specify filters combined 
provide full boolean functionality need provide mechanism grouping operations 
define lens filtering function composition mode describes result filtering function combined output lenses underneath 
formally lens filter boolean operator 
filter describes output calculation filter datum 
mode describes output combined output lower filters 
example result positioning 
conversely effect positioning 
implement composition mode button lens making easy change mode needed 
operation encoded lens filter inverts sense data coming 
formalism previous paragraph inverting lens null 
applies output lower filters intrinsic filter function 
example consider query filter various attributes 
implement query user lay filter filter composition mode set 
incorporate grouping need mechanism encapsulating expression defined stack lenses 
provide operation replaces stack lenses single compound lens semantically equivalent 
example create query create compound lenses values parentheses 
giving lens mode create desired expression positioning 
compound lenses may contain compound lenses allowing queries grow arbitrary complexity 
compound lenses created selecting point stack lenses

extensions previous section discussed movable filters perform general boolean queries scatterplot data 
section discuss extending power filters support real valued queries undefined data values 
real valued queries provide way better understand range values generated query extended system allow filters assign real valued score range datum 
data score fails filter entirely data score succeeds entirely data intermediate scores partially satisfy filter 
provides information value returned query 
result visually showing datum partially filled square higher score square filled 
example boolean filter screening crime rate dallas fort worth seen high crime rates 
switch real valued filters see dallas lower crime rate fort worth 
general scoring function arbitrary filter prefer data extreme values assign gaussian falloff data highest score going data certain value similar metrics 
example values displayed computed follows 
boolean case filter slider value describes threshold 
example threshold 
slider setting set data threshold score case arlington 
city greatest value data case crime data happens atlanta crime index assigned score 
cities values threshold maximum assigned simple linear score equal value divided maximum value 
slider setting set scores similar manner 
boolean query crime rate cities texas 
real valued query crime rate cities texas 
extending filters boolean valued real valued allows distinctions maintained 
response function filter assigns scores datum arbitrary defined filter 
implementation filters step linear functions due limitation imposed technique 
real valued filters composed define composition modes min max diff 
min max correspond boolean fuzzy logic 
min max false true incorporate values 
real valued filter returns minus input value 
diff composition mode example defined absolute value difference operands 
overlaying real valued filter obtain way visualize correlations filters

asking figures different see poverty crime rates correlated cities 

real valued filters combined numerical operators 
diff operator show relationship poverty crime rate

example shows query centered west coast filtering cities severe traffic delays 
san francisco shown delays 
adding representation missing data shown see california communities don data category san francisco unattractive appeared 

filter finds city san francisco high score 

missing data lens shows attribute values missing cities 
cities missing data marked 
incorporated missing data semantics composition considering missing data analogous ieee concept non signaling number nan value defined afford retrospective diagnostic information inherited invalid unavailable data results

applying magic lens filters problem exploring visualizing data creates user model expressive easy understand 
placing lens data evokes physical model lens filtering enhancing view data beneath 
including slider lens allows user dynamically vary query adjusting filter threshold 
overlapping filters creates natural metaphor creating compound queries
