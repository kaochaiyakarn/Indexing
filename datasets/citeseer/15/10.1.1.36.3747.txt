detailed discussion binding strategy usefulness 
clustering major problems overview diagrams screen gets cluttered information reasonably sized hypermedia system 
way overcome problem reduce information needs shown screen suitable abstractions 
abstractions show user information space cluttering screen 
example obviously possible show entire gvu www pages single screen 
may form abstraction clusters files directory single node 
example similarity clustering clustering done authors 
clusters different authors gvu www pages formed 
shapes represent type authors circles represent students 
clustering possible abstracted views 
example number directories large abstraction represents directory single node may confusing user 
may clustering example topic pages 
abstracted views able show information space single screen cluttering 
user better feel global information structure abstracted views 
depending intentions goals users different kinds abstractions useful 
example user may want see abstraction information space topic 
user may want see abstraction author pages 
abstracted navigational views really useful allow interactive specification abstractions 
types clustering types clustering useful 
follows 
structure clustering structure clustering hypermedia structure searched subnetworks match pattern 
subnetworks form cluster 
simplest form type clustering link clustering nodes joined particular class links clustered 
example overview diagram may want form clusters nodes linked annotation links 

content clustering type clustering nodes hypermedia considered individually attributes examined determine clusters 
simplest form content clustering nodes attributes satisfy certain properties form cluster 
abstracted view gvu www research pages 
abstractions done directory sub topic topic viewing abstracted structure 
user seeing details research pages 
details layer shown plane 
layers arranged dimension detailed view research pages front 
user cluster nodes value certain attribute 
user generate clustering command value attribute quite tedious 
attribute similarity clustering allowed value specified attribute clusters nodes having value formed 
example pages built author clustered shown 
allow clustering done interactively essential clustering algorithms efficient 
discuss clustering algorithms 
note clustering combined binding information clusters shown visually 
shapes represent type authors circles represent students 
visualizing abstracted views series clustering user able see global view information space 
user gets idea global structure generally want details part top view structure making hierarchy formed abstraction layers apparent 
user seeing details hypertext research area 
colors represent different research areas 
space problem abstracted views details lost user 
show details context developed visualization strategy dimensions 
initially user shown abstracted view 
abstraction done directory sub topic topic user wants details particular node details shown front layers move deeper 
example shows view user wanted see details research pages 
plane showing details particular layer layers arranged dimension detailed view research pages front 
argued details available context move deeper deeper screen 
eye point shifted bring different parts space focus 
example front view back side top views provided 
shows top view information space user wanted see details hypertext research area 
note colors represent different research areas 
allow smooth animation view changes abrupt allows user see changes easily 
view shows details user interest context integrated single screen 
noted user generally see details part space view confusing 
filtering reduce complexity overview diagrams user may want remove unwanted information show useful information 
allow various filtering options 

content type filtering nodes attributes satisfy certain properties shown hidden 
example shows pages related research example content filtering showing pages related animation research 
example structure filtering showing html pages linked images movies 
icons represent media types pages 
animation 

link type filtering certain types links shown hidden 

structure suppose organizations guidelines employees making www home pages 
may state central html page linked gif file html page 
administrator pages may wish check people guidelines 
traditional content database querying help 
allow structure querying allows showing hiding certain subgraph patterns 
example shows html pages linked images movies 
icons represent media types pages 
note filtering algorithms similar clustering algorithms 
note content filtering similar concept dynamic queries 
previous sections assumed overview diagrams node link graph diagrams
