naive physics event perception lexical semantics language acquisition companion siskind argues early bootstrapping stages language acquisition children start knowing syntax meanings words children aided task hypothesizing set potential meanings utterance heard 
example child hearing utterance john entered room look environment see john standing walking opening door outside room inside room possible events occurring environment unrelated john 
hypothesizing utterance refers events aids learner figuring individual words mean syntactic categories words syntactic parameters language learned

topic addressed 
want understand child perception world aid language acquisition task look evidence knowledge pre linguistic children possess prior linguistic activity 
discusses habituation experiments attempt elucidate knowledge 
experiments provide evidence pre linguistic children possess kinds knowledge knowledge objects take space pass continuity knowledge object appearing point point moved continuous path points gravity knowledge unsupported objects fall ground plane knowledge ground offers universal support objects 
refer collectively pre linguistic principles 
currently writing program called abigail attempts incorporate pre linguistic knowledge simulated language learner test hypothesis knowledge aid language acquisition task 
abigail watches computer animation constructed line segments circles 
animation abigail receives narration text describing events occurring movie 
experimental paradigm having learner acquire new word meanings watching movie explored rice 
case learner machine child 
techniques incorporate aforementioned principles abigail analyzes animation frame frame produces semantic representation events occurring animation 
events semantic representation constitute meanings hypothesized utterances appearing narrative text 
siskind presents learning algorithm utilize semantic representation learn syntactic categories meanings words 
focuses produce semantic representation visual input models children pre linguistic knowledge 
abigail lives microworld animated movies 
movies contain objects participate events 
ontology microworld differs somewhat world 
importantly ontology abigail world similar world model pre linguistic principles continuity gravity ground plane 
frame abigail movies shown 
movie man walks table picks ball walks back forth putting back table 
woman repeats actions man goes picks ball gives woman puts back table 
abigail computational mechanisms specific particular objects event movie 
system discussed badler abigail possess prior object event models 
furthermore animation generated program distinct abigail 
abigail access internal data structures animation program 
abigail observes positions sizes shapes orientations line segments circles comprising animation frame 
information abigail utilizes theory pre linguistic principles continuity gravity ground plane construct semantic representation objects events animation 
modification abigail watch different animation containing different objects participating different events able perform semantic analysis yield appropriate representation objects events new movie 
remains agnostic pre linguistic knowledge innate acquired early months life 
theory frame abigail movies 
mentioned previously abigail directly perceive objects people tables chairs 
abigail perceives figures line segments circles objects constructed interprets certain collections figures objects 
particular abigail understands figures may joined 
denote joint connecting figures joint described parameters displacement joint length displacement joint length angle formed joint rigid flexible independently dimensions 
rigid joint parameter fixed value flexible joint parameter leaves value unspecified 
technical reasons require displacement parameters joint rigid 
set figures connected joints interpreted object 
abigail directly perceive joints figures 
infers joints necessary explain unfolding animation pre linguistic principles 
furthermore set joints parameter values need invariant duration movie 
course movie joints may change rigid flexible vice versa may appear disappear completely 
allows new objects built combining old objects old objects broken parts objects broken fixed 
abigail continually maintain update joint model world understand construction destruction events 
abigail microworld nominally dimensional world 
figures perceives directly contain depth information 
dimensional world capable supporting interesting model 
motion objects dimensional world obeys highly constrained 
humans view animation man walks side table disturbed fact doing man figures overlap table figures 
entertain possibility man walking table 
assume man walking front table 
similar fashion abigail attempts reconstruct depth information explain image principle 
perceiving depth information directly abigail constructs depth model assigns certain figures constituting image layer different layers 
model comprises set assertions form layer layer figures known layer layer layer known layer 
figures layer obey 
layer model constitutes partial third dimension 
abigail requires times layer model complete consistent equivalence relation necessary total 
layer layer layer layer abigail infer layer layer 
likewise layer layer layer layer abigail infer layer layer 
pairs layers abigail may know layer 
note layers ordered particular notion adjacent layers 
additionally assignment figures layers may change course movie 
abigail continually update layer model maintain internal consistency judgments changing world 
layer model consists list 
layer assertions 
new assertions added front list 
new assertions added check consistency successively longer initial prefixes model

ai consistent prefix 
ai assertion ai removed model 
repeated entire model consistent 
abigail apply pre linguistic principles update layer joint model 
frame abigail looks types evidence pair figures 
evidence assertion layer layer added model 

evidence assertion layer layer added model 

evidence parameter joint demoted rigid flexible 

evidence existing joint removed model 

evidence parameter joint promoted flexible rigid 

evidence new joint added model 
forms evidence infer case support collision 
figures touch fall supported abigail infer layer 
likewise moves touches moves away laws physics apparent collision gives evidence figures layer 
collision detection currently implemented abigail 
similar fashion forms evidence case overlap exiting apparent container 
direct observation figures overlap give clear evidence different layers 
furthermore initially surrounded moves longer surrounded principles continuity imply figures different layers 
currently direct observation implemented abigail 
case observation value rigid parameter joint changed evidence parameter 
observation figures longer intersect evidence case 
abigail currently implement evidence case 
case abigail infers new joint figures touch figures cease touch effect gravity connected joint 
general abigail hypothesizes new joints layer assertions account stability object image attempts hypothesize minimal set new joints layer assertions layer assertions priority new joints offer explanatory power 
central process mechanism determining support relationships objects 
abigail uses simulator purpose 
simulator takes figures appearing current frame set joints layer assertions predicts image change effect gravity 
simulator essentially quantitative kinematic simulator incorporates pre linguistic principles continuity gravity ground plane 
lacks notion dynamics momentum kinetic energy friction 
adequate determining support relationships objects layer relationships figures necessity joints figures 
abigail continually performs simulations frame hypothesizing happen world different sets joint layer assertion assumptions 
fairly strong psychological implications 
abigail plausible reflection human perception humans shown capable performing simulations shown performing fairly regularly albeit 
freyd cheng gives evidence humans perceive objects displace slightly downward falling support removed 
abigail constructed joint layer model frame collected connected figures objects computes relations objects regions space occupy exists object exists continually frames contacts object touches layer object continually frames joined frames objects joined joint connecting 
supports frames object falls image simulated object object fall image simulated object
