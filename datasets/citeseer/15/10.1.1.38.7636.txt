section discusses related section contains concluding remarks 
data model relational model augmented certain object oriented features useful describing reasoning contents information sources 
data model includes ffl relations arity 
ffl classes class hierarchy 
partial order oe oe class subclass class ffl set attributes associated class 
class inherits attributes superclasses 
attributes may single valued multi valued 
relations contain tuples classes contain objects 
object unique identifier 
attribute values relation class atomic values strings integers object identifiers 
object may belong class classes related oe 
possible declare pair classes disjoint meaning object belong classes 
order able treat relations classes uniformly associate unary relation class binary relation attribute class 
contents relations follows convention relation associated class name class similarly attributes ffl class hxi identifier object classes ffl attribute class hx hxi called filler 
single valued attributes denote value hold 
order relations fully capture semantics class hierarchy enforce certain integrity constraints 
constraints take form inclusion dependencies functional dependencies 
particular ffl oe viewed classes inclusion dependency holds viewed relations 
ffl auxiliary relation corresponding single valued attribute functional dependency ffl pair disjoint classes holds viewed relations 
example table shows classes attributes 
example car oe automobile automobile oe product relationships 
automobile oe product automobile inherits attribute model product classes declared disjoint reflecting fact car new 
class disjoint disjointness information inferred class hierarchy motorcycle disjoint oe car car disjoint motorcycle 
class subclass attributes disjoint product model person automobile product model year category stereo motorcycle automobile model year car car automobile model year category motorcycle car model year category car model year category car model year category price table class hierarchy

world view information manifold user poses queries terms world view collection virtual relations classes 
world view schema 
term world view schema emphasize fact data stored relations classes world view 
serves schema user poses queries freeing user having interact source schema individually describing contents information sources explain section 
example world view consists classes table attributes single valued relation model year review 
relation contains triples review product model manufactured year example product review consumer reports 
queries query conjunctive query set relations world view join queries allow order relations appear queries require queries range restricted 
example query asks models prices reviews sale manufactured earlier query example category year price model font denote constants lowercase letters variable names

describing information sources queries posed system terms world view 
data answer queries stored external information sources 
answer query need descriptions relate contents information source classes attributes relations world view 
furthermore sources may able answer arbitrary queries contents need describe capabilities information sources order create plans executed 
contents information sources desiderata descriptions contents information sources ffl number information sources large frequently changing able add new information sources changing world view time add information source affecting descriptions information sources 
ffl sources contain closely related information descriptions able model fine grained differences contents set sources relevant query determined tightly possible 
ffl able develop efficient algorithms determine set sources relevant query generate query plans access sources 
model contents information source tuples relations objects classes 
challenges arise precisely describing contents sources terms world view 
adding new information source case tuples source correspond directly tuples relation world view 
example suppose world view includes relation teaches course teacher hour room online course listing available course teacher pairs 
introduce new relation corresponding pairs world view doing means modifying world view 
furthermore require having relations world view expressing complex dependencies order capture relationship contents different sources 
solution describe online course listing containing tuples relation course teacher teaches 

objects tuples information source may thought belonging directly relation class world view may wish specify certain additional source cars sale 
contents capabilities category category year price price source luxury cars sale 
cars database priced contents price capabilities category category year price source vintage cars sale cars manufactured 
contents year capabilities category year price source motorcycles sale

contents car model year capabilities fm yg fm rg fg source descriptions sources constraints objects tuples satisfy 
example consider vintage car information source example 
object source belongs class specify cars source manufactured saw additional information prune source irrelevant query example 
solution problems specify tuples objects information source terms query relations world view 
example say online course listing source discussed contains tuples relation course teacher course teacher teaches course teacher hour room describe vintage car source containing tuples relation year formally source modeled containing tuples relation relations call source relations 
names source relations disjoint names world view relations 
source relation specify conjunctive query world view describes conditions tuples relation satisfy 
note source need contain tuples satisfy query example database cars sale contains cars sale

shows content descriptions corresponding informal descriptions 
emphasized features data model class hierarchy disjointness classes built predicates fact describe contents queries enables describe tightly contents sources able prune sources relevant query 
furthermore adding sources affect descriptions information sources 
section show effectively descriptions create query plans 
noted claim data model integrates relational object oriented data model 
simply provides mechanism necessary describe sources data models query 
capabilities information sources content description tells information source tell queries source answer contents 
conventional relational database answer relational query relations 
information sources general may permit subset relational queries relations 
example saw cars sale database example answers query price range category car cars category available sale price range 
source answer query list cars database 
furthermore source contains instances class may able answer queries subset attributes class 
generating query plans important adhere capabilities information sources exploit possible 
example query plan involving sources different plan involving sources source able perform selection year car 
describe capabilities information source capability records 
capability records meant capture kinds capabilities encountered practice ability sources apply limited number selections limited forms variable bindings information source accept called query templates 
capability records specify inputs source minimum maximum number inputs allowed possible outputs source selections source apply 
sources capabilities perform arbitrary relational operators considered lru 
formally capability record specifies parameters source 
parameter source relation variable attribute name source relation associate exactly capability record form sel min max sel sets parameters min max integers 
variable appear variable attribute 
meaning capability description 
order obtain tuple information source information source binding min elements provide values elements ff ff obtain tuples information source satisfy ff ff elements parameters returned information source 
elements sel subset parameters source apply selections form ff op constant op source relation providing information source values elements ff ff asking values fi fi passing selections fl fl source produce tuples satisfy conjunction gammar xm ff ff fi fi fl fl content description form qr input output specifications described called augmented description input output specifications qr ff ff fi fi fl fl query planning algorithm specific canonical augmented description inputs include outputs include selections 
example vintage car information source handle query relation bind model category handle range selections year price 
return model year price category seller contact information car 
describe capability record category category year price price lists capability records describing information sources example 
query plans query plan sequence accesses information sources interspersed local processing operations 
query plan combine information various sources way guarantees semantically correct answers adhere capabilities information sources 
explain notions 
query form cq plan answer consists set conjunctive plans 
conjunctive plans conjunctive queries specify inputs outputs subgoal 
formally conjunctive plan form sel vm sel source relation

define semantic correctness conjunctive plan consider augmented content descriptions information sources 
recall input output specifications information source modeled containing subset tuples relation defined conjunctive query consider expansion plan query obtained expanding definitions subgoals formally obtained replacing subgoal body query unifying head variables conjunctive plan said semantically correct contained extension world view relations satisfies integrity constraints answer subset answer example consider query asking sports cars manufactured category year price model semantically correct plan query model fy ear category fm model ear frg fg see consider expansion query obtained unfolding augmented descriptions category model year price query contained see suppose tuple generated satisfies conjuncts body body contains conjuncts body query contains additional conjuncts satisfy query answers query definition semantically correct plan required contained equivalent reasons 
equivalent answer obtained executing conjunctive plan may complete sources may incomplete
