information retrieval problem information storage retrieval attracted increasing attention 
simply stated vast amounts information accurate speedy access difficult 
effect relevant information gets ignored uncovered turn leads duplication effort 
advent computers great deal thought provide rapid intelligent retrieval systems 
libraries certainly information storage retrieval problem mundane tasks cataloguing general administration successfully taken computers 
problem effective retrieval remains largely unsolved 
principle information storage retrieval simple 
suppose store documents person user store formulates question request query answer set documents satisfying information need expressed question 
obtain set reading documents store retaining relevant documents discarding 
sense constitutes perfect retrieval 
solution obviously impracticable 
user time wish spend time reading entire document collection apart fact may physically impossible 
high speed computers available non numerical thought computer able read entire document collection extract relevant documents 
soon apparent natural language text document caused input storage problems left unsolved intellectual problem characterising document content 
conceivable hardware developments may natural language input storage feasible 
automatic characterisation software attempts duplicate human process reading sticky problem 
specifically reading involves attempting extract information syntactic semantic text decide document relevant particular request 
difficulty information retrieval knowing extract information decide relevance 
comparatively slow progress modern linguistics semantic front conspicuous failure machine translation bar hillel show problems largely unsolved 
reader noticed idea relevance slipped discussion 
notion centre information retrieval 
purpose automatic retrieval strategy retrieve relevant documents time retrieving non relevant possible 
characterisation document worked document represents relevant query enable document retrieved response query 
human indexers traditionally characterised documents way assigning index terms documents 
indexer attempts anticipate kind index terms user employ retrieve document content describe 
implicitly constructing queries document relevant 
indexing done automatically assumed pushing text document query automatic analysis output representation content document relevant query computational procedure show 
intellectually possible human establish relevance document query 
computer need construct model relevance decisions quantified 
interesting note research information retrieval shown concerned different aspects model 
information retrieval system illustrate means black box typical ir system look 
diagram shows components input processor output 
may little components constitute convenient set pegs hang discussion 
starting input side things 
main problem obtain representation document query suitable computer 
emphasise computer retrieval systems store representation document query means text document lost processed purpose generating representation 
document representative example list extracted words considered significant 
computer process natural language alternative approach artificial language queries documents formulated 
input queries documents 
typical ir system feedback processor output evidence show effective barber 
course presupposes user willing taught express information need language 
retrieval system line possible user change request search session light sample retrieval hoped improving subsequent retrieval run 
procedure commonly referred feedback 
example sophisticated line retrieval system medline system 
think fair say short time retrieval systems line 
secondly processor part retrieval system concerned retrieval process 
process may involve structuring information appropriate way classifying 
involve performing actual retrieval function executing search strategy response query 
diagram documents placed separate box emphasise fact just input retrieval process way structure correctly seen part retrieval process 
come output usually set citations document numbers 
operational system story ends 
experimental system leaves evaluation done

list called keywords derived document 
addition frequency occurrence words body text indicate degree significance 
provided simple weighting scheme keywords list available document representative form weighted keyword description

book keyword term interchangeably 
statistical information distributions words documents exploited maron kuhns stiles obtained statistical associations keywords 
associations provided basis construction thesaurus aid retrieval 
early research brought publication washington symposium statistical association methods mechanized documentation stevens 
sparck jones carried measures association keywords frequency occurrence frequency keywords occur document 
shown related words effectively improve recall increase proportion relevant documents retrieved 
interestingly early ideas luhn developed automatic methods characterisation early 
term information structure want better words covers specifically logical organisation information document representatives purpose information retrieval 
development information structures fairly 
main reason slowness development area information retrieval long time realised computers information retrieval give acceptable retrieval time large document set logical structure imposed 
fact owners large data bases try new organisation techniques promising faster better retrieval 
slowness recognise adopt new techniques mainly due experimental evidence backing 
earlier experiments document retrieval systems usually adopted serial file organisation efficient sufficiently large number queries processed simultaneously batch mode proved inadequate query required short real time response 
popular organisation adopted inverted file 
restrictive salton 
experiments attempted demonstrate superiority clustered files line retrieval 
organisation files produced automatic classification method 
suggest automatic classification prove useful document retrieval 
years serious experiments carried document clustering doyle rocchio 
experiments far small scale 
clustering comes scale increased hoped book may encourage large scale experiments bringing necessary tools 
evaluation retrieval systems proved extremely difficult 
excellent survey states doubt system evaluation troublesome area isr am inclined agree 
despite excellent pioneering done cleverdon area despite numerous measures effectiveness proposed see robertson substantial list general theory evaluation emerged 
attempt provide foundations theory chapter page 
past debate validity evaluations relevance judgments provided human beings 
katter supposed relevance measurable ordinal scale arises operation rank ordering showed position document scale affected external variables usually controlled laboratory 
lesk salton subsequently showed dichotomous scale document relevant non relevant subjected certain probability error invalidate results obtained evaluation terms precision proportion retrieved documents relevant recall proportion relevant documents retrieved 
today effectiveness retrieval measured terms precision recall measures thereon 
adequate statistical treatment showing appropriate significance tests may shall return point chapter evaluation page 
decades research area basically precision recall working hypothesis states quoting cleverdon single system assuming sequence sub searches particular question logical order expected decreasing precision requirements stated question inverse relationship recall precision results number different searches averaged 
effectiveness efficiency research development information retrieval aimed improving effectiveness efficiency retrieval 
efficiency usually measured terms computer resources core backing store time 
difficult measure efficiency machine independent way 
case measured conjunction effective ness obtain idea benefit terms unit cost 
previous section mentioned effectiveness commonly measured terms precision recall 
repeat precision ratio number relevant documents retrieved total number documents retrieved recall ratio number relevant documents retrieved total number relevant documents retrieved retrieved 
reason emphasising measures frequent retrieval effectiveness detailed discussion delayed chapter

emphasis chapter statistical word loosely usually simply implies counting linguistic approaches automatic text analysis 
reasons emphasis varied 
firstly limit space 
attempt discussion semantic syntactic methods applicable automatic text analysis probably fill book 
luckily book written sparck jones kay montgomery written surveying linguistics information science 
secondly linguistic analysis proved expensive implement clear enhance information retrieval 
part problem little progress formal semantic theory 
reason optimism front see example keenan undoubtedly theory language extreme importance development intelligent ir systems 
date theory sufficiently developed applied successfully ir 
case satisfactory possibly document retrieval systems built theory 
thirdly statistical approach examined tried days luhn moderately successful 
chapter starts original ideas luhn automatic text analysis built goes describe concrete way generating document representatives 
furthermore ways exploiting improving document representatives weighting classifying keywords discussed 
passing evidence automatic indexing 
luhn ideas luhn early papers states proposed frequency word occurrence article furnishes useful measurement word significance 
proposed relative position sentence words having values significance furnish useful measurement determining significance sentences 
significance factor sentence combination measurements 
think quote fairly summaries luhn contribution automatic text analysis 
assumption frequency data extract words sentences represent document 
frequency occurrence various word types position text rank order order frequency occurrence plot relating yields curve similar hyperbolic curve 
fact curve demonstrating especially see review damerau 
automatic text analysis zipf law states product frequency wards rank order approximately constant 
zipf verified law american newspaper english 
luhn null hypothesis enable specify cut offs upper lower see excluding non significant words 
words exceeding upper cut considered common lower cut rare contributing significantly content article 
devised counting technique finding significant words 
consistent assumed resolving power significant words meant ability words discriminate content reached peak rank order position half way cut offs peak fell direction reducing zero cut points 
certain arbitrariness involved determining cut offs 
oracle gives values 
established trial error 
interesting ideas really basic ir 
luhn devise method automatic abstracting 
went develop numerical measure significance sentences number significant non significant words portion sentence 
sentences ranked numerical score highest ranking included extract really 
edmundson gone generalise luhn normalising measurements respect frequency occurrence words general text 
reason analysis restricted just words

information retrieval generating document representatives conflation ultimately develop text processing system means computable methods minimum human intervention generate input text full text title document representative adequate automatic retrieval system 
tall order partially met 
document representative am aiming consisting simply list class names name representing class words occurring total input text 
document indexed name significant words occurs member class 
system usually consist parts removal high frequency words suffix stripping detecting equivalent stems 
removal high frequency words words words way implementing luhn upper cut 
normally done comparing input text list words removed 
table gives portion list demonstrates kind words involved 
advantages process non significant words removed interfere retrieval size total document file reduced cent 
second stage suffix stripping complicated 
standard approach complete list suffixes remove longest possible 
table lists suffixes 
unfortunately context free removal leads significant error rate 
example may want ual removed factual equal 
avoid erroneously removing suffixes context rules devised suffix removed context right 
right may mean number things length remaining stem exceeds number default usually stem satisfies certain condition words equivalent sense map morphological form removing suffixes 
equivalent 
category requires special treatment 
probably simplest method dealing construct list equivalent stem endings 
stems equivalent match endings appear list equivalent 
example stems absorb conflated entry list defining pt equivalent stem endings preceding characters match 
assumption context ir words underlying stem refer concept indexed 
obviously oversimplification words stem neutron need distinguished 
words essentially equivalent may mean different things different contexts 
cheap way making fine distinctions put certain proportion errors assume correctly degrade retrieval effectiveness 
inevitable processing system produce errors 
fortunately experiments shown error rate tends order cent andrews 
lovins slightly different approach stemming quotes errors order magnitude 
description stages deliberately underlying mechanism explained

index term weighting traditionally important factors governing effectiveness index language thought exhaustivity indexing specificity index language 
information retrieval debate exact meaning terms 
wishing enter controversy shall follow keen giving working definition 
document indexing exhaustivity defined number different topics indexed index language specificity ability index language describe topics precisely 
keen define indexing specificity level precision document indexed 
difficult quantify factors 
human indexers able rank indexing approximately order increasing exhaustivity specificity 
easily done automatic indexing 
importance able quantify notions indexing exhaustivity specificity predictable effect retrieval effectiveness 
recognised lancaster high level exhaustivity indexing leads high recall low precision conversely low level exhaustivity leads low recall high precision 
converse true levels indexing specificity high specificity leads high precision low recall optimum level indexing exhaustivity specificity user population 
quite people sparck jones salton yang attempted relate factors document collection statistics 
example exhaustivity assumed related number index terms assigned document specificity related number documents term assigned collection 
importance vague relationship factors related distribution index terms collection 
relationships postulated consistent observed trade precision recall just mentioned 
changes number index terms document lead corresponding changes number documents term vice versa 
am arguing distributional information index terms provide say index term weighting really attacking old problem controlling exhaustivity specificity 
go back luhn original ideas remember postulated varying discrimination power index terms function rank order frequency occurrence highest discrimination power associated middle frequencies 
model proposed selection significant terms document 
frequency counts provide weighting scheme individual terms document 
fact common weighting scheme gives index term weight directly proportional frequency occurrence document 
scheme appear inconsistent luhn hypothesis discrimination power drops higher frequencies 
referring back scheme consistent upper cut moved point peak occurs 
fact happened experiments particular form weighting 
attempts apply weighting way index terms distributed entire collection 
index term vocabulary document collection zipfian distribution count number documents index term occurs plot rank order obtain usual hyperbolic shape 
sparck jones showed experimentally documents index term occurs weight log leads effective retrieval term unweighted 
indexing specificity assumed inversely proportional number documents index term occurs weighting seen attaching importance specific terms 
difference mode weighting previous may summarised saying document frequency weighting places emphasis content description weighting specificity attempts emphasise ability terms discriminate document 
salton yang attempted combine methods weighting looking inter document frequencies intra document frequencies 
really extension reached luhn 
considering total frequency occurrence term distribution documents times occurs terms defined page 
automatic text analysis document able draw 
term high total frequency occurrence useful retrieval irrespective distribution 
middle frequency terms useful particularly distribution skewed 
rare terms skewed distribution useful middle frequency ones 
rare terms quite useful come bottom list ones high total frequency 
experimental evidence insufficient precise statement merits 
salton workers developed interesting tool describing index bad 
assume index term assigned index term collection documents renders documents dissimilar possible bad term renders documents similar 
quantified term discrimination value particular term measures increase decrease average dissimilarity documents removal term 
term removal collection documents leads decrease average dissimilarity adding lead increase bad term leads removal increase 
idea greater separation documents enhance retrieval effectiveness separation retrieval effectiveness 
superficially appears reasonable really required relevant documents separated relation non relevant ones 
experiments term discrimination model reported connection term discrimination inter document frequency supporting earlier results reported salton wong yang main results conveniently summarised yu salton formal proofs retrieval effectiveness improvement strategies frequency data 
example inverse document frequency weighting scheme described assigning weight proportional log shown formally effective weights 
course achieve proof kind specific assumptions measure effectiveness match documents queries 
establish effectiveness technique conflate low frequency terms increases recall technique combine high frequency terms phrases increases precision

automatic keyword classification automatic retrieval systems rely thesauri modify queries document representatives improve chance retrieving relevant documents

manually constructed thesaurus system type 
methods proposed construct thesauri automatically 
manual thesauri semantically recognise synonyms general specific relationships automatic thesauri tend syntactically statistically

measures association classification methods binary relationship objects 
basis relationship classification method construct system clusters 
relationship described variously similarity association dissimilarity 
ignoring dissimilarity moment defined mathematically terms mean association reserved similarity objects characterised discrete state attributes 
measure similarity designed quantify likeness objects assumes possible group objects way object group members group object outside group cluster method enables group structure discovered 
informally speaking measure association increases number proportion shared attribute states increases 
numerous coefficients association described literature see example goodman kruskal kuhns cormack sokal authors pointed difference retrieval performance achieved different measures association insignificant providing appropriately normalised 
intuitively expect measures incorporate information 
lerman investigated mathematical relationship measures shown monotone respect 
follows cluster method depending rank ordering association values identical clusterings measures 
commonly measures association information retrieval 
information retrieval documents requests commonly represented term keyword lists shall simplify matters assuming object represented set keywords counting measure gives size set 
easily generalise case keywords weighted simply choosing appropriate measure measure theoretic sense 
simplest association measures simple matching coefficient number shared index terms

attempt summarise simplify kind data classification methods 
excellent surveys classification methods exist name ball cormack fact methods classification numerous necessary give classification classification 
sparck jones provided clear intuitive break classification methods terms general characteristics resulting classificatory system 
follows primitive notion property mean feature object 
quote relation properties classes relation objects classes exclusive overlapping relation classes classes ordered unordered category explored thoroughly numerical taxonomists 
early statement distinction class ordinarily defined set properties necessary sufficient stipulation membership class 
possible define group terms set properties 
fn different manner 
suppose aggregate individuals shall call class possesses large unspecified number properties possessed large number individuals possessed individual aggregate 
sentence statement refers classical aristotelian definition class termed 
second part defines 
illustrate basic distinction consider example individuals properties 
possession property indicated plus sign 
individuals constitute group individual possessing properties individuals split classes

attempt minimise amount information thrown away put differently classification sense closest original data overlapping classes allowed

give detailed account heuristic algorithms shall discuss main types refer reader developments citing appropriate authors 
proceeding need define concepts designing algorithms 
important concept cluster representative variously called cluster profile classification vector centroid 
simply object summaries represents objects cluster 
ideally near object cluster average sense term centroid 
similarity objects representative measured matching function called similarity correlation function 
algorithms number empirically determined parameters number clusters desired minimum maximum size cluster threshold value matching function object included cluster control overlap clusters arbitrarily chosen objective function optimised 
algorithms iterative final classification achieved iteratively improving intermediate classification 
algorithms defined level classification obviously extended multi level classification simple device considering clusters level objects classified level 
probably important kind algorithm rocchio clustering algorithm developed smart project 
operates stages 
stage selects criterion number objects cluster centres 
remaining objects assigned centres rag bag cluster 
basis initial assignment cluster representatives computed objects assigned clusters 
assignment rules explicitly defined terms thresholds matching function 
final clusters may overlap object may assigned cluster 
second stage essentially iterative step allow various input parameters adjusted resulting classification meets prior specification things cluster size nearly 
third stage tidying 
unassigned objects forcibly assigned overlap clusters reduced 
algorithms aim reducing number passes file object descriptions 
small number clustering algorithms require pass file object descriptions 
name single pass algorithm 
basically operate follows object descriptions processed serially object cluster representative cluster subsequent object matched cluster representatives existing processing time object assigned cluster overlap allowed condition matching function object assigned cluster representative cluster recomputed object fails certain test cluster representative new cluster 
information retrieval final classification dependent input parameters determined empirically different different sets objects specified advance 
simplest version kind algorithm probably due hill subsequently variations produced mainly result changes assignment rules definition cluster representatives

algorithm extensively murray generating hierarchic classifications

algorithm mentioned due algorithm designed objects described binary state attributes 
uses cluster representatives matching functions entirely different way 
algorithm shuffles objects attempt minimise average number different attributes members cluster 
clusters characterised sets attribute values set set attributes common members cluster 
final classification hierarchic 
details approach see bonner algorithm mentioned 
hybrid graph theoretic heuristic approaches 
initial clusters specified graph theoretic methods association measure objects reallocated conditions matching function 
major advantage algorithmically defined cluster methods speed order log number objects clustered compared order methods association measures 
disadvantages 
final classification depends order objects input cluster algorithm suffers defect order dependence 
additional effects errors object descriptions unpredictable 
obvious omission list cluster methods group mathematically statistically methods factor analysis latest class analysis 
methods originally ir see borko baker largely superseded cluster methods described 
method single link avoids disadvantages just mentioned 
appropriateness document clustering discussed

output hierarchy associated numerical levels called dendrogram 
frequently hierarchy represented tree structure node represents cluster 
representations shown side side set objects 
clusters level level level

mathematical definition dendrogram exists little omitted 
interested readers consult jardine sibson give reader better feel single link classification worked example see 
dc dissimilarity coefficient characterised set graphs value taken dc 
different values taken dc example 
graph level set vertices corresponding objects clustered vertices linked dissimilarity equal value level clear graphs characterise dc completely 
graphs interpretation dc recovered vice versa 
graphs values taken dc simply smallest value taken dc example compare graphs 

dendrogram corresponding tree simple matter define single link terms graphs level single link cluster precisely set vertices connected component graph level 
diagram enclosed cluster dotted line 
note graphs distinct values taken dc different necessarily case corresponding clusters levels 
may increasing level links introduced vertices change total number connected vertices component 
example clusters levels 
hierarchy achieved varying level lowest possible value increasing successive values dc objects contained cluster 
reason name single link apparent object belong cluster needs linked member cluster 
description immediately leads inefficient algorithm generation classes 
demonstrated example 
simply consists thresholding dc increasing levels dissimilarity 
binary connection matrices information retrieval calculated threshold level connected components easily extracted 
basis published single link algorithms 
point view ir trying construct searchable tree inefficient see van rijsbergen appropriate implementation 
appropriateness stratified hierarchic cluster methods hierarchic cluster methods name complete link critique methods see sibson concern indicate appropriateness document retrieval 
realise kind retrieval intended entire cluster retrieved subsequent processing documents cluster 
contrast methods proposed rocchio crouch clustering purely help limit extent linear search 
stratified systems clusters appropriate level cluster retrieval strategies parameter analogous rank position matching function threshold linear search 
retrieval cluster match request low level hierarchy tends produce high precision low recall just cut low rank position linear search tends yield high precision low recall 
similarly retrieval cluster match request high level hierarchy tends produce high recall low precision 
hierarchic systems clusters appropriate reasons 
efficient strategies devised search hierarchic clustering 
secondly construction hierarchic systems faster construction stratified overlapping system clusters 
thirdly storage requirements hierarchic structure considerably non hierarchic structure particularly classification phase

furthermore log methods tested single level classifications doubtful able preserve log dependence generate hierarchic classifications 
experiments dealing documents may find proportionality constant log method large actual time taken clustering greater method

file structure specify logical structure data relationships exist data items independently way relationships may realised computer 
logical aspect concentrate 
physical organisation concerned optimising storage medium particular logical structure stored 
typically unit physical store number units logical structure probably records stored 
example store tree structure magnetic disk physical organisation concerned best way packing nodes tree disk access characteristics disk 
data bases concerned concept called data independence 
aim enable programs written independently logical structure data interact 
independence takes form file structure overnight changed inverted serial file program remain unaffected 
independence achieved interposing data model user data base 
user sees data model data base programs communicate model 
user interest structure file 
school thought says says applications library automation information retrieval follow path 
unfortunately debate data model look 
furthermore operational implementations advanced theoretical systems exist 
suggestion ir system implemented data base package premature 
scale problems ir efficient implementation application demands close scrutiny file structure 
worth seriously trend away user knowledge file structures trend stimulated considerably attempts construct theory data number proposals dealing data level 
best known put forward codd known relational model

may application field library automation information retrieval implemented appropriate data base package 
certainly possibility happen near 
reasons 
data base systems general purpose systems automated library retrieval systems special purpose 
normally pays price generality case great 
secondly considerable investment providing special purpose systems example marc written easily 
trend increasing data base technology exists illustrated increased prominence annual review information science technology 
language describing file structures subjects computer science terminology file structures evolved concern consistency ambiguity possible kind distinctions important 
need defined unambiguous language describe file structures apparent 
particular arose need communicate ideas file structures getting bogged hardware considerations 
section formal description file structures 
framework described important understanding file structure 
terminology introduced hsiao harary see hsiao manola hsiao 
terminology modified extended summary van rijsbergen formalised different framework provides interesting contrast described 
basic terminology set attributes set values record subset cartesian product attribute value 
set ordered pairs form attribute value 
example record document processed automatic content analysis algorithm 
km xm ki keywords functioning attributes value xi thought numerical weight 
frequently documents simply characterised absence presence keywords case write kt kt 
kt kt xt absent 
records collected logical units called files 
enable refer set records name file name 
records file organised relationships records 
logical organisation known file structure data structure 
difficult describing file structures keep logical features separate physical ones 
characteristics forced recording media tape disk 
features defined abstractly little gain easily understood illustrated concretely 
feature field 
implementation record attribute values usually positional identity attribute position attribute value record 
data record registered sequentially definite 
record said divided fields nth field carries nth attribute value 
pictorially example record associated fields 

example record associated fields fields necessarily constant length 
find value attribute find address record address start record read data th field 
picture shown fields labelled pi 
addresses records commonly called pointers 
extended definition record set attribute value pairs pointers 
pointer usually associated particular attribute value pair 
example see pointers link records value attribute similarly equal file structures 
demonstration pointers link records indicate record record pointed list records null pointer 
pointer associated attribute record called pointer 
attribute keyword way organise file called key 
unify discussion file structures need concepts 
hsiao harary define list records respect keyword briefly list set records containing pointers distinct non null pointer gives address record unique record pointed record containing called list list 
unique record containing null pointer hsiao harary state condition slightly differently lists record common appears complicate things 
previous example list list list need definition directory file 
file records contain just different keywords 
km 
ni number records containing keyword ki hi number ki lists furthermore denote aij address jth ki list 
directory set sequences ki ni hi ai ai 

position give unified treatment sequential files inverted files index sequential files multi list files 
sequential files sequential file primitive file structures 
directory linking pointers 
records generally organised lexicographic order value key

scatter storage hash addressing file structure relate ones mentioned known scatter storage 
technique file structure implemented called hash addressing 
underlying principle simple 
may access data number keys ki address data store located key transformation function applied ki evaluates give address associated data 
assuming key associated data item 
convenience assume record data key fits location address image space addresses application keys ki called hash addresses called hashing function 
ideally spreads hash addresses uniformly available storage 
course achieved function 
unfortunately range possible key values usually considerably larger range available storage addresses 
hashing function contend fact distinct keys ki kj map address ki kj 
explain ways dealing shall give examples hashing functions 
assume available storage size simple transformations follows ki key take square binary representation select bits middle result cut binary representation ki pieces bits add 
select significant bits sum hash address divide integer corresponding ki length available store remainder hash address 
methods disadvantages 
example may address frequently patterns keys 
particular method reader advised consult extensive literature subject morris lum mentioned problem collisions distinct keys hash address 
point problem destroys simplicity hashing 
initially may thought key need stored data hash address 
unfortunately 
matter method resolve collisions need store key data search time key hashed distinguish data data associated keys hashed address 
number strategies dealing collisions 
essentially fall classes pointers link collided keys 
look ones pointers 
mechanism searching store starting address collision occurred empty storage location record needs inserted matching key value retrieval time 
simplest advances hash address time moving fixed number locations say empty location matching key value 
collision strategy traces defined sequence locations 
method dealing collisions called linear method 
tendency method store collided records closely initial hash address possible 
leads undesirable effect called primary clustering 
context means records tend concentrate groups bunch 
destroys uniform nature hashing function 
precise desirable hash addresses equally empty location collision sequence increases likelihood proportion number records collision sequence 
see needs realise key hashed location sequence record stored sequence 
big groups records tend grow bigger 
phenomenon aggravated small step size seeking empty location 
case collision strategy known open addressing technique 
primary clustering worse hash table available storage relatively full 
variations linear method avoid primary clustering involve making step size variable 
way set equal ai bi ith step 
invoke random number generator calculates step size afresh time 
collision handling methods called quadratic random method respectively 
avoid primary clustering subject secondary clustering caused keys hashing address sequence search empty location 
avoided see example bell 
second class collision handling methods involves extra storage space chain collided records 
collision occurs hash address may head chain records hashed address may record stored belongs chain starting address 
cases free location needed case simply linked stores new record second case intermediate chain element moved free location new record stored hash address starting new chain chain far 
variation method level store 
level hash table second level bump table contains file structures collided records 
hash address hash table find record collisions taken place address pointer chain records collided address 
chaining method advantage records need moved entered bump table 
storage overhead larger records put bump table hash table full 
classes collision strategies needs careful deletions 
linear quadratic collision handling strategies ensure delete record address records collided address unreachable 
similarly chaining method ensure deleted record leave gap chain deletion chain reconnected 
advantages hashing 
firstly simple 
secondly insertion search strategies identical 
insertion merely failed search 
ki hashed key search collision sequence fails turn match ki record simply inserted sequence free location 
thirdly search time independent number keys inserted 
application hashing ir tended area table construction look procedures 
obvious application constructing set conflation classes text processing 
chapter gave example document representative simply list class names name standing set equivalent words 
retrieval operation query converted list class names 
significant word needs looked dictionary gives name class belongs 
clearly case hashing
