metaphor recognised serve fundamental structural role organization conceptual systems previously held view metaphor deviant peripheral rhetorical effect language 
revised view justified necessitates major rethinking current language interpretation mechanisms carries serious ramifications model semantic memory underlying comprehension process

describing surgeon butcher communicate similarity surgeons cut flesh provide extensible framework similarities may newly perceived possibly time surgeons deserve paid human flesh merely kind meat may eaten 
systematicity metaphor organic language tool emerges systematic interaction conceptual schemata relevant knowledge shapes interpretation maximally coherent contents memory see lakoff johnson

analogue bindings guided syntax phrase structurally equivalent consensus world assumptions 
assumptions violated viewing russia puppet bulgaria puppeteer reverse mappings naturally systematically accommodated network assumptions
