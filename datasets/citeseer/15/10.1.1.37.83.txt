durfee developed meta level information exchange approach coordination called partial global planning agents build share local plans means identifying potential improvements coordination partial global plans pgps exchanged agents means building representations acquaintances activities indicate goals pursued order results achieved long goal take 
individual community members model representation acquaintances identify agents pgps objectives part larger community effort 
complimentary activities detected related pgps combined single larger pgp provides complete view group activity 
agents revise pgps reflect new position may consequently decide alter local plans better utilise community resources 
example pgp indicate partial solution formed agent provides useful predictive information acquaintance 
expectation transmission partial solution explicitly represented pgp resulting plan information resources effectively 
second example agent may survey current view community wide pgps identify acquaintances utilised whilst 
modifying pgps agent propose community transfer subproblems better team

approach differs standard multi agent planning section agents reach mutual agreements multi agent commitments partial plans change fluidly takes time propagate changes 
agent indicates particular region search space important honour commitment failure result misleading information spread network incoherent problem solving 
approaches commitments irrevocable form convention needed monitoring progression 
pgp approach example agents altered local plans new tasks arrived actions took longer expected commitments needed updated 
agents informed minor change commitments cause chain reaction spreads system 
agents adopted implicit convention informed acquaintances deviations deemed significant 
multi agent planning approach coordination agents usually form multi agent plan specifies actions interactions respect achievement particular objective 
details execution commences areas search space traversed route taken decision point agent involved activity 
multi agent plans typically built avoid inconsistent conflicting actions particularly respect consumption scarce resources 
multi agent planning differs organisational structuring meta level information exchange terms level detail specifies agent activities 
agents know advance exactly actions take actions acquaintances take interactions occur 
requiring complete specification behaviour plans realistically short time horizon problems unpredictability dynamicity events environment 
plan construction take account possible choice points agent reached benefit constraining information actual execution approach requires substantially computational communication resource mechanisms 
basic approaches multi agent planning centralised distributed 
georgeff developed system plans individual agents developed separately sent central coordinator analysed identify potential interactions 
coordinator identified interactions cause conflicts grouped sequences unsafe situations create critical regions 
inserted communication commands individual plans agents synchronise activities appropriately 
cammarata 
devised centralised multi agent planning system air traffic control 
aircraft agent sends coordinator information intended actions 
coordinator builds plan specifies agents actions including actions node take avoid collisions 
distributed multi agent planning plan developed agents 
means may individual global view community activities detecting resolving undesirable interactions significantly difficult 
corkill developed distributed hierarchical planner noah sacerdoti agents represent model nodes plan execution coordinated explicit synchronisation primitives 
rosenschein genesereth logic approach study agents common goal different local information exchange information converge identical plans 
plan devised agents involved committed performing specified actions 
believed acquaintances keep enter planning phase place resource consuming activity 
commitments foundation approach
