game theory models negotiation game theory concerns mainly determining conditions outcomes game predicted 
particular solutions game theory consist equilibrium strategies 
notion nash equilibrium heavily relied 
profile strategies forms nash equilibrium player strategy optimal response players strategies 
nash equilibrium players take opponents strategies consider possibility influencing 
games player chooses actions observing opponents actions dynamic games conjecture leads absurd nash equilibria 
selten proposed restrictive equilibrium concept dynamic games subgame perfect equilibrium 
basic idea subgame perfect equilibrium select nash equilibria involve non credible threats threat carried player put position threat move give player lower payoff get doing threatened action 
games complete information notion turns powerful 
limiting games complete information 
dynamic games incomplete information player observes move extract information 
inference process takes form bayesian updating second player supposed equilibrium strategy observed action 
games selten introduced notion perfect bayesian equilibrium 
outcomes games depend party believes second response actions 
information sets reached bayes formula hold 
equilibrium path move player designed influence opponent beliefs move equilibrium path considered zero probability event chosen 
selten equilibrium notion adequately restrict equilibrium beliefs enabling players establish credibility threats
