integration speech recognition image processing natural language processing information retrieval overcomes limits technology create useful system 
order answer question speech recognition order useful usable indexing retrieving speech recognizer generated transcripts empirical evidence illustrates degradation information retrieval different levels speech accuracy 
experiments word error rates significantly impact information retrieval error rates provided recall precision relative fully accurate transcripts retrieval system 
informedia vast digital libraries video audio information available world wide web result emerging multimedia computing technologies 
simply store play back information commercial video demand services intend 
new technology needed organize search vast data collections retrieve relevant selections permit reused effectively 
integration technologies fields natural language understanding image processing speech recognition video compression informedia digital video library system wactlar allows user explore multimedia data depth breadth 
overview system shown 
process automatically segments hours video programming small coherent pieces indexed multimedia content 
users actively explore information finding sections content relevant search path material serially viewing single large chunk pre produced video 
active exploration far flexible provided video demand way viewing content permitted 
flexible interfaces provided current generation educational cd roms users follow designed path material passive manner 
goal informedia computer serve just sophisticated video delivery platform 
informedia digital video library library creation video speech recognition audio text digital compression distribution translation toolkit offline image extraction segmentation indexed database indexed transcript segmented compressed audio video natural language interpretation users library exploration online story choices spoken natural language query semantic expansion translation requested segment indexed database indexed transcript segmented compressed audio video overview informedia digital video library system provides user tool assemble large corpus instructive set video segments relevant particular information need 
tool large library video material searched little effort 
informedia project developing new technologies embedding video library system primarily education training 
establish effectiveness technologies project establishing line digital video library consisting hours video material 
order able process search volume data practical effective efficient tools essential 
news demand hauptmann particular collection informedia digital library served proving ground automatic library creation techniques 
news demand complete automation principal goal 
motivated timeliness required news data volume material indexed day project applied speech recognition natural language processing image understanding creation fully content indexed library interactive querying 
centered processing news stories tv broadcasts informedia library creation process exemplified demand represents approach video audio text data accessible 
speech recognition informedia speech informedia digital video library creating time aligned word index video accompanying audio track 
alignment existing imperfect transcripts spoken words creating complete transcripts exist 
speech recognition online querying users feature discussed 
speech recognition alignment word spoken particular point video 
know point facilitate browsing navigation users 
example just user knows dear don give spoken movie gone wind quite tedious locate exact scene context phrase just text transcript 
missing information alignment transcript words precise location word spoken milliseconds 
process alignment simple dynamic time warping algorithm 
quality transcript speech recognition transcript words transcripts aligned dynamic time warping dtw procedure 
misrecognized word suffixes common source recognition errors distance metric words alignment process degree initial sub string match 
low recognition accuracy alignment existing transcript provides sufficiently accurate timing information 
informedia system uses information allow user jump directly location movie particular query term spoken 
user avoids viewing complete video order find words query
