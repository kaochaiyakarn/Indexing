base discussion concrete example shall consider wireless temperature sensor 
nearby nodes may authorised request current temperature register watch cause thermometer send reading temperature enters specific range 
wish thermometer useful widest range environments including environmental monitoring industrial process control medicine

contrary academic tradition shall examine opposite order certainly case reflects actual importance 
mention resource constraints networks operate 
system constraints main constraints piconet similar systems support ad hoc networks battery operated personal devices follows peanut cpu computing power processor node typically small large computations slow 
battery power total energy available node scarce resource 
node likes go sleep possible 
desirable idle time perform large computations background 
high latency conserve power nodes time turn receiver periodically 
communicating nodes involves waiting wake 
resurrecting duckling consequence constraints strong symmetric cryptography feasible modular arithmetic di cult strong asymmetric cryptography 
peanut node embedded camera interacts powerful embedded mobile phone laptop may techniques low exponent rsa protocols designed peanut node sticks cheap operations encryption verification avoiding expensive ones decryption signature 
generally trade security say battery life may want user control 
example thermometer drive wall display living room shows outside temperature owner opt validated encrypted communication means change battery month year 
challenge integrate flexibility system introducing major architectural holes sort allow attacker turn security 
availability availability means ensuring service ered node available users expected 
non military scenarios security property greatest relevance user 
counts little device 
radio jamming traditional threat model derived military attacker deny service nodes area jamming radio frequencies 
traditional include spread spectrum frequency hopping force attacker jam wider frequency band power 
revisit briefly section 
concerns relevance commercial world attacks dealt authorities having operator jamming station arrested 
novel interesting service denial threat di erent concerns battery exhaustion 
battery exhaustion malicious user may interact node legitimate way purpose consume battery energy 
battery life critical parameter portable devices techniques maximise piconet example nodes try spend time sleep mode listen radio signals period set seconds minutes 
environment power frank stajano ross anderson exhaustion attacks real threat powerful better known denial service threats cpu exhaustion battery runs attacker walk away leaving victim disabled 
call technique sleep deprivation attack 
public access server necessarily tension contrasting goals useful unknown users 
applications restrict access known principals web servers name servers infeasible usefulness service comes universally available 
server primary function sending outside temperature meteorological ce hour distinct auxiliary function sending current temperature requests functions prioritised reservation mechanism ensure higher priority receives guaranteed share resource regardless number requests generated lower priority uses 
highest priority may battery management estimate fairly accurately amount usable energy remaining service monitored managed provided process consume resource intended conserve 
authenticity principal talk 
applications thermometer broadcast temperature readings general send recipients authorised way 
example hospital authorised send temperature readings doctor palmtop computer nursing station 
required restrict transmission temperature particular station device 
usual authorisation mechanisms turn interesting case involve centralised system administrator 
may implemented access control lists administrator tells thermometer authorised capabilities administrator gives principals signed certificate thermometer want reading 
ad hoc network environment poses fundamental new problem absence online server 
interactions administrator thermometer manufactured personalised institution owns may expensive time consuming may entail establishing network connection central server gossiping intermediate nodes bringing management device physically close ected node 
particular case thermometer device calibrated months time new security state loaded rapid changes may expensive central administrator regularly 
resurrecting duckling follows length validity period certificates access control lists trade timeliness convenience 
relying expiration dates imposes nodes extra cost running secure clock holder expired certificate reset node clock time validity period 
piconet nodes normally onboard clock classical approach authentication suspect 
better way 
secure transient association novel interesting authentication problem ad hoc networks wireless devices secure transient association 
householder owns device say universal remote control lets control various devices home hi fi television components heating system lights locks burglar alarm need ensure new device buys shop obey commands neighbour 
want assured burglar take heat sensing garden unlock back door just sending command remote control bought shop 
secure means association controller peripheral transient 
householder gives away television set hi fi fridge obey controller controller breaks decides replace upgrade operating system able regain control gadgets owns 
central authentication service possible expensive consumer durables governments run services houses cars 
prospect extended durable consumer goods uk government abandoned dog licensing years ago 
case grave civil liberties objections government maintaining lists pcs hi fis dvd players country pentium iii processor id indicates level political resistance 
existing central services short managing keys replacement car keys left motor trade house locks completely uncontrolled 
desirable key management performed locally thing want impose expensive unpopular central solution 
nice provide means making stolen dvd player harder 
insight comes scenarios pool identical devices bowl containing 
doctor really care thermometer gets picks care palmtop talks holding bowl nearby ward 
potential applications wireless devices require establishing secure transient association principals typically necessarily user peripheral 
example significant interest possibility police fire held cer frank stajano ross anderson issued purpose wearing short range radio ring usa large number injuries sustained come stolen police guns 
similar considerations apply substantial weapon systems artillery fall enemy hands

phase said shared secret established duckling mother 
think easy 
principals involved perform expensive public key operations decrypt sign device simply generates random secret encrypts public key powerful device gets back signed confirmation
