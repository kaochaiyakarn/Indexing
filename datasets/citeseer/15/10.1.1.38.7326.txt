information technology promotion agency ipa developing network intrusion detection system named ida intrusion detection agent system 
ida distinctive features conventional intrusion detection systems lack 
feature mechanism tracing origin break means mobile agents 
second feature way ida detects intrusions watches events may relate intrusions continuously monitoring user activities 
event discovered mobile agents gather information related 
purpose explain implementation ida rapid growth internet number security relevant incidents internet increased 
internet experienced remarkable changes past years 
example ffl possible get cracking tools information cracking internet ease 
ffl increase sites connected internet people experienced network management act network administrators 
circumstances great need tools automatically detect intrusions 
commercial intrusion detection systems ids currently available difficult average sites employ ids difficult install maintain expensive high overhead 
intruders tend attack destination hosts indirectly intruders systems computer break ins 
cases target intermediate host notices intrusion 
information technology promotion agency ipa developing network intrusion detection system called ida intrusion detection agent system detects intrusions mobile agents act gathering information related intrusions target systems network 
goals ida ku tokyo japan ku tokyo japan 
reduce overhead system detect new unknown forms attack 
easy maintain 
trace intrusion routes detect compromised intermediate hosts believe ids meets goals 
easy introduce ids average sites works 
mainly describes functions ida section describes structure action ida section describes implementation evaluation ida section outlines indicates direction 
intrusion detection system ida analysis intrusion patterns methodology intrusions detected divided categories follows ffl anomaly intrusion detection ffl misuse intrusion detection anomaly intrusion detection system records users activities systems builds statistical profiles activities records 
regards activities differ remarkably normal intrusions 
misuse intrusion detection refers intrusions follow defined intrusion patterns written system advance 
misuse intrusion detection new unknown forms attack anomaly intrusion detection ineffective detecting insider attacks intrusion detection system employs methods limited range intrusions detect 
intrusion detection systems intend avoid pitfalls usually involve concurrent employment misuse anomaly techniques 
anomaly intrusion detection portion ids usually large slow result impractical average site ids employs techniques 
developing ida propose new intrusion detection method place anomaly detection misuse detection 
ida reduce overhead system detect new unknown forms attack 
goal detect intrusions precisely detect intrusions efficiently 
prior designing ida investigated patterns internet intrusions discovered typical computer break ins normally adhere patterns follows ffl remote attack remote attack attack initiated machine attacker currently access 
ffl local attack local attack attack initiated machine attacker access attempts exceed authority 
generally attacker attempts remote attack get unauthorized access target system attempts local attack get authority super user privileges 
attacker authorized user insider target system attempts exceed authority 
analyzed intrusion patterns classified stages 
attackers achieve goals stages described 
search stage activity stage masquerade stage mark stage scanning ord guess brute force ord crack execute privileged user authorized new user authorized user activity activity activity file stages intrusion patterns search stage search stage occurs attackers search target systems gather information 
put concretely attackers attempt discover software target system vulnerability users predictable passwords systems promiscuous mode scanning tools password cracking tools network command finger 
activity stage activity stage occurs attackers series activities allow break target systems example intrusion activity exploits interactive mode rsh suid shell script 
mark stage mark mark stage refers certain attackers goal effect break target system 
call mark mlsi mark left suspected intruders 
example mark left result modified password file 
define mlsi event attacker directly proceed masquerade stage described attack activity 
masquerade stage masquerade stage occurs intruder authorized user authorized privileged user authorized new user process gets unauthorized access target system 
intrusion activity remote local attack different view information reported cert find mlsi common cases type mlsi limited 
example cases attackers modify password files password modification mlsis 
described goals intruders limited define mlsis match goals detect intrusions means monitoring mlsi 
hypothesize detect intrusions means monitoring mlsis 
intrusions detected means monitoring mlsis mlsis left intruders activities authorized users activities 
mlsis common authorized root activities 
example modifying password file mentioned activity engaged intruders legitimate super users password file modification necessarily indicate break 
ida collect information related mlsi password modification case 
done steps follows 
ida monitors determine mlsis left
