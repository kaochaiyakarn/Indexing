line inquiry opened exploring excess returns provided simple moving average trading rules 
pioneering done brock lakonishok lebaron demonstrating simple moving average trading rule produced significant excess returns applied lebaron extends techniques foreign exchange markets 
researchers stepped traditional moving average rules examine ability genetic programming automatically generate complex trading rules 
allen explored approach rules earned excess returns buy hold strategy

economists interested addressing issues market efficiency computer scientists optimizing search algorithms produce best results possible

fitness profitability trading rule measured terms excess returns 
excess returns measure money gain trading minus cost capital borrow trade 
consequently excess returns measure fitness 
measure log excess returns finance literature returns traditionally converted log form easy manipulation long position borrow dollars buy foreign currency follows

provisions transaction costs 
algorithm system follows standard genetic programming framework 
data structures deliberately mimic traditional moving average trading rules 
rules usually involve comparisons moving average max min statistics computed past price signals 
typical rule current price greater day moving average past prices take long position take short position 
example day moving average rule 
order allow representations rules complex variants set trees kinds nodes ffl leaf nodes consist function current price series moving averages mins time windows varying 
ffl higher level nodes consist types comparison nodes 
ffl logical nodes logical xor 
set operations trees crossover mutation structures sense created sense means comparison nodes leaves children logical nodes comparison nodes children 
essentially allows arbitrary logical traditional moving average rules ruling potentially absurd combinations comparisons logical values 
reasons computational efficiency precomputed min max moving average functions different windows sizes ranging 
caching results greatly speeded fitness computations 
high level algorithm goes follows ffl split data training validation testing sets ffl generate population rules ffl pick rules weighted fitness perform crossover ffl pick rule random mutate 
ffl new rules generated crossover mutation pick single existing rule compare fitness training set new rule greater fitness keep 
ffl keep track average rule fitness validation set excess returns generated rule ffl repeat average rule fitness validation set starts decline ffl evaluate rules test set 
key differences algorithm traditional genetic programming approach 
lack traditional generation structure entire population undergoing crossover mutation operation time 
reason see search domain progresses quickly order examine happening finer resolution level afforded traditional generation structure needed 
second presence validation set determining search 
contrast problems genetic methods applied looking ability generalize purely optimized training set tend overfit data 
similar methods traditionally neural networks machine learning methods
