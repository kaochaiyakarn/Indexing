classical nash equilibrium achieved assumption agent rationality 
biological context appeal rationality achieve optima 
central contribution evolutionary game theory substitution agent rationality darwinian selection 
egt replicator dynamics allow nash equilibria achieved 
nd certain nash equilibria attractors dynamical system 
evolutionary game theory operates exclusively phenotype space replicator equations perform selection genotype space assumed construct variational operators 
fact focal point debate darwinian egt great success analyzing empirical data population mathematics clearly show genetics easily contradict darwinian reasoning 
theory evolution addresses apparent paradox shows long term outcome coevolution fact adequately described phenotypic level

distinction important simple genetic algorithm optimal phenotype 
coevolution polymorphic optima achieved speci phenotype proportions remain intact 
time scales selection search initial population state iteration selection operator variation limit 
variation operators applied know phenotypes absent appear 
know phenotypes may eliminated selection 
ordinary evolution limit behavior point attractor composed exclusively phenotype assuming absence neutrality 
coevolution limit behavior di erent assuming tness proportionate selection attractor may limit cyclic xed point 
point attractor exists game constant sum may easily composed phenotype phenotype linear stability analysis tells strategies support coevolutionary point attractor strategies highest scoring strategies population states epsilon attractor

selection methods exhibit attractors chaotic unrelated game 
implementation decisions may sound ordinary evolutionary algorithms pathological idealized coevolutionary context search problem solved leaving problem selection dubious real world algorithm 
shown truncation selection reason simulations fogel lead claim egt loses predictive power nite populations 
population structures coevolutionary algorithms genetically isolated populations typically involve asymmetric games agents population play agents 
evolutionary game theory tells asymmetric games result polymorphic equilibria 
feature property games property population structure asymmetric games happen require 
population structure symmetric game polymorphic attractor polymorphic attractor disappear 
case game single population agents yields polymorphic attractor hawks 
game played separate populations population converge hawks 
multiple population structures evolutionary algorithms including coevolution maintain genetic diversity 
coevolutionary context uence population structure transcend process genotypic search exert independent unintentional ect process phenotype selection 
evolutionary game theory shows search problem solved priori di erent population structures may lead di erent outcomes game remains 
local optima variational operators unable reach new phenotypes suf ciently survive selection respect current population allow search continue state evolutionary system local optimum

dominating strategies important concept game theory dominance 
strategy pure mixed said dominate strategy better strategies game strictly better 
exists strategy better weakly dominates strictly dominates pure strategy strictly dominates replicator dynamics remove population 
necessarily true weak dominance 
replicator dynamics removes strategies strictly dominated pure strategies case non overlapping generations suggests performing operation akin multi objective optimization strategy represents objective coevolutionary problem 
comparing strategies salient question beats game scores played series opponents pareto dominates respect set opponent strategies including 
notion pareto dominance multi objective optimization confused pareto dominance respect game payo game theory 
observation leads realization multi objective optimization techniques may explicitly applied coevolutionary domains replicators strictly weakly dominated strategies rejected favor pareto optimal strategies 
approach may longer qualify coevolutionary algorithm suspect may provide powerful method optimizing coevolutionary domains
