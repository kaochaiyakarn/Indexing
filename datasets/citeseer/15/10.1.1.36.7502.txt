approach requires single mouse movement click invoke action 
second monitor displays processes support primary task reduces cognitive load allowing rapid glances check information example bird eye view entire graphical object close detail

development focused getting display software application program interface little attention human computer interface intelligent exploitation system applications 
installation program careless clicking menu item monitor caused dialogue box appear far corner monitor easily went unnoticed 
multiple monitor display space handled single coordinate space includes negative numbers monitor left primary monitor 
applications handle negative numbers 
demonstration apps wrong re aware explained respondent demonstrating object popping dialogue box far user focus attention 
user prefers keep desktop icons far right rightmost monitor invokes arrange icons utility moves left 
moves back time 
systems support better serve example applications real difference 
thought appear dual monitors 
dialogue boxes items placed randomly inconsistently

informants laboriously regularly rearrange multiple windows drag place

powerpoint application simultaneously illustrates potential intelligent need better understand 
editing slides secondary display defined system installation opens slide show view slide show appears primary monitor

god aware engineer describing internally developed utility benefits arbitrary division space users initially consider second monitor inferior twice large monitor 
began dual monitors substantial cost difference 
retrospect clear single large space preferable 
ability park objects periphery advantage 
consider analogy space house 
people generally value large rooms value rooms 
bedroom house large bedroom house moderately sized bedrooms 
case second room different purposes office guest room 
master bedroom purposes doesn twice large 
wall difference 
similarly multiple monitors division spaces facilitate versatility 
consider difference single large meeting room small breakout rooms 
arrangement valuable different tasks optimal 
monitors rooms equal size may arbitrarily assigned different functions rooms different size may assigned functions part requirements different tasks 
large displays find significant uses afforded 
includes shared physical spaces large manually updated status boards today 
popularity monitors indicates growth display size welcome desktop particularly flat panel displays come price 
remain place arbitrary division space provided multiple monitors 
prefer house rooms accepting arbitrary constraints large room freely arrange things 
users palmtop displays running alongside large pc monitors point benefit small increment space partition space dedicated purpose accessible glance 
opportunities design really neat realize help show monitor respondent discussing office software application just give spec developer asked difficulty coding application enhancements dual monitor users doubling display space solve information management problem help 
information equal want things brought attention want available periphery 
multiple monitors naturally 
segment display space manner clear human software software takes notice 
users dedicate monitor focal task second peripheral awareness frequently resources get little assistance applications arranging things 
applications awkward capability 
consider cad designers opened toolbar menus dragged second monitor easy access 
bare minimum system remember placement people repeatedly organize 
better application propose logical arrangement toolbar functions second monitor 
designer consider scenario briefly design process 
design alternatives roughly comparable may lend graceful second monitor 
opportunities exploit second monitor evident exemplified making status help information visible fast paced games 
application find peripheral information usefully placed periphery 
course side 
primary applications second monitor reduce usefulness notification awareness external events easily accessing personal resources 
thought division features multiple monitors 
applications advised resist available space may need monitors 
opportunity exists design suites awareness notification features draw full range communication agent software person selects 
space segmented events originating team members organizational changes news alerts arriving internet communications friends family 
rare priority developers 
exploit capability monitor costs continue drop snowball 
seeing benefits people obtain second monitors making support worthwhile intelligent design get ahead curve increase acceleration 
hindsight findings may appear common sense relatively people demonstrate awareness 
example world largest companies single pane glass campaign limit computer monitor office 
resulting warehouse full extra monitors sold apiece
