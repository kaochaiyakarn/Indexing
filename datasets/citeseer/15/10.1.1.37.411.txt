temporal shifts associated time units minutes days units weeks 
temporal annotation written ess lss efs lfs 
illustrates time annotation 
ess lss efs lfs unknown undefined allow incomplete time annotation 
cases hours hours hours hours time interval exact starting finishing times respectively 
duration specified duration maximal duration equal minimal duration
