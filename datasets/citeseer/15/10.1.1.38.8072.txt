selective fingerprinting mentioned earlier full fingerprinting conceptually useful practical sizes fingerprints generated 
reduce size fingerprint select subset substrings full fingerprint 
goal treat documents vary size words words meeting tight space constraints chosen select fixed number substrings independent size document 
call fixed size selective fingerprinting 
alternative select fixed proportion substrings size selective fingerprint proportional size document 
main drawback alternative space consumption provide accurate fingerprinting documents words need fingerprint containing substrings means fingerprints size documents containing words 
design fixed size selective fingerprinting system revolves choices fingerprint size selection strategy substrings se lect full fingerprint 
discuss subsections 
fingerprint size security employ different size fingerprints storage search fingerprints store database size fingerprints searching size 
importantly search fingerprint document strict superset fingerprint storage 
reasons choice 
reliability intimately connected design decisions discussed subsection 
second motivation security want system resilient attack 
illustrate issue suppose fixed size fingerprints storage search selection strategy publicly known 
case easy determine substrings part fingerprint changes appropriate places version longer matches original 
making selection strategy public keep secret example secret seed value guide selecting strategy trial error process possible find appropriate set changes example chop original document pieces search separately pieces identify selected substrings 
provide better security periodically changing stored fingerprint document 
fingerprints provides particularly convenient way achieve obtain new stored fingerprint simply choosing different subset search fingerprint ratio sizes involved gives considerable scope change 
advantage approach need change search engine generate search fingerprint search modified stored fingerprint 
important allows change database incrementally update stored fingerprints documents time transparent manner 
support process maintain list urls document retrieve document recompute fingerprint desired 
maintain contact email address document help resolve stale urls 
envision updating fingerprints regular basis months year irregular updates suspicious activity relating document unusually large number searches 
selection strategy simple strategy random selection 
gives poor results 
example suppose document length gives rise possible substrings length ff substring fingerprints storage substring fingerprints search 
consider matching document 
probability particular substring appears storage fingerprint 
expected number substrings search fingerprint match storage fingerprint theta match ratio 
results course worse documents related identical 
provide reliable matches selection strategy select similar substrings similar documents 
approach employ string hash function fingerprint size obtained picking substrings lowest hash values 
approach related hash function approach gives similar results reduces false positives

limitations fixed length fingerprints important measure reliability fingerprinting scheme closely results correlate full fingerprinting 
fixed length selective fingerprinting approach chosen correlation documents similar size problematic documents significantly different size 
specifically show documents identical size expected match ratios fixed length selective fingerprinting identical full fingerprinting 
documents different size results vary ratio high ratio sizes documents 
illustrate problem consider extreme case matching document words document words suppose smaller document appears larger document 
stored fingerprint larger document size average substring word piece larger document 
words stored fingerprint larger document substring common smaller document match ratio compared match full fingerprinting 
currently investigating ways address issue including variable sized fingerprints flagging low match ratios significant document sizes vary significantly

early experiments indicate factor possible 
simple indexing scheme number drawbacks

second documents added overhead overflow blocks significant 
example documents words fingerprints occupy blocks giving rise average chain length disk probes document search search fingerprints size 
issues addressed sophisticated indexing disk management schemes 
document noise generate fingerprints perform document matching obtain text versions documents 
unfortunately unreliable process introduces errors 
main formats wish support postscript 
postscript interpreters adapted produce text typically slow produce poor results 
alternatively postscript output specific tools exploit format postscript generated tool recover text quickly fairly accurately case example tex generated postscript 
problem formats change tools evolve need different programs deal different postscript tools 
postscript conversion main errors introduced involve punctuation non alphabetic characters spacing 
particular word boundaries distorted 
secondary problems vowels uppercase lowercase distinctions 
factor problems ignoring non vowel characters converting lower case 
allows fast postscript text converters string extraction translator modified version jason black ps txt program turn program 
focusing non vowel characters converting lower case obtained reliable results generated tex microsoft word framemaker 
note considering consonants approach document substrings character subsequences original document 
subsequences length typical distribution consonants corresponds spans characters original document 
reducing false positives goals system provide reliable low level match information particular reduce number false positives 
important number reasons 
identification low level matches appears interesting search paradigm locating related documents 
second helps offset limitations fixed length fingerprints 
third important performance implications context database millions documents false positives significantly increase cost searching 
fingerprint generation selection strategy choose substrings include fingerprint significant impact number false positives 
issue substrings occur significantly frequently orders magnitude 
frequent substrings selected fingerprint fingerprint construction consider substring frequency 
illustrate potential impact suppose substring equally appear document consider comparing unrelated documents 
hash function behaved search fingerprint contains randomly selected elements space elements storage fingerprint contain randomly selected elements space 
probability element space appear fingerprints probability particular element appears multiplied number possible elements 
approximated theta theta 
database documents expect random noise hits search 
suppose fingerprint consists substrings times frequent average 
probability substring match documents increases factor theta near random noise hits search documents 
significantly reduce false positives substring selection strategy frequency measures 
way compute set substrings document pick frequently occurring substrings 
computationally expensive yield results space substrings document useful indication frequency substrings 
frequency measure letters substring 
cheaper compute gives useful results 
intuition distribution letter sequences specific document useful approximation general distribution letter sequences 
pick substrings letters occur infrequently document letters substrings occur infrequently general 
substrings letters occur infrequently entire substring occurs relatively infrequently 
section give experimental evidence indicates technique reduce false positives factor 
underlying approach assumption substring frequency distribution significant overlapping text segments vary substantially frequency distribution text segments imply match ratios related documents affected focusing infrequent substrings 
assumption appears valid practice 
problem letter frequency distributions substring selection different documents may slightly different letter frequency distributions 
different size fingerprints storage search provides effective way address 
illustrate consider substring common documents selected stored fingerprint infrequent frequency measure may appear stored fingerprint frequency measures differ probably appear larger search fingerprint moderately infrequently frequency measure 
way identify infrequent substrings fingerprint database provide frequency measures 
disadvantage approach fingerprint generation longer performed stand operation 
potential reliably identify infrequent substrings deserves investigation
