tacair soar system tacair soar symbol processing rule system built soar architecture cognition laird newell rosenbloom 
soar uses production rules basic unit long term knowledge program 
rules soar propose select apply operators correspond actions goals human pilots perform mission 
operators intercept enemy act goals dynamically decomposed rules proposing primitive operators achieve actions 
rules test current situation including available sensors mission parameters avoiding fixed scripted responses 
example shown tacair soar operators intercept aircraft 
discrete action system just soar creates new goal structure 
context new goal system proposes additional operators achieve proximity aircraft search aircraft employ weapons aircraft 
operator fully decomposed primitive operator selected rules create appropriate commands motor system select missile fire push fire button set aircraft fly particular heading soar supports dynamic hierarchical decomposition execution complex operators 
organization appears correspond way human pilots organize knowledge provides readable traces behavior terms operator selections decompositions 
dynamic hierarchical decomposition important encoding structured knowledge official doctrine tactics overly restrictive multiple goals pursued 
tacair soar operator hierarchy usually corresponds explicit goals subgoals mission executed 
additional implicit goals tacair soar give rise actions world 
example flight plane may notice new blip radar 
bringing different information sources interpreting identity blip deliberate act performed operator 
operator directly part goal executing mission part implicit goal maintaining situational awareness 
similarly plane may need take evasive actions danger response survival goal 
operators part explicit goal hierarchy 
represented opportunistic operators selected independently currently active explicit goals 
mixture goal driven opportunistic behaviors crucial capturing ways humans interleave complex sequences actions service multiple goals jones 
goal driven opportunistic operators proposed current situation 
operator hierarchy defines part situation includes sensory data internal model agents world

blip range blip heading blip bearing target heading target range target aspect target bearing attack heading best missile sample active goal situation hierarchies execute mission intercept employ weapons launch missile desired heading consider case aircraft potential target contact radar screen 
cases important reason heading bearing contact 
important notice target flying left right computed combination target heading agent heading

generation goals features fairly rapid soar capable firing hundreds rules second take time computational resources 
undesirable agent routinely expend significant effort maintaining hierarchies 
hierarchical representation system incremental adjustments current mental state situation warrants 
agent chosen missile employ target target position information aim aircraft best shot 
target turns small amount may lead change active hierarchies 
change target heading cause rule fire computes new attack heading agent adjust aircraft heading response 
target turns larger amount new geometry situation may take target envelope currently selected missile 
cause agent delete current launch missile goal select new missile create new launch missile goal 
target turns larger amount example run away agent may significant adjustments leading situation 
case agent determines target may running away longer need shoot
