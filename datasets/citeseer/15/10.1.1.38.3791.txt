example ffl salaries functional may different salaries database state 
ffl salary may decrease evolution database 
concept integrity constraint intimately connected database evolution matter database evolves constraint true database futures 
follows order formal sense integrity constraints need prior theory database evolution 
databases change 
way predefined update transactions ffl change person salary 
ffl register student course 
shall assume transactions provide mechanism database state changes 
reiter propose databases represented situation calculus updatable relations fluents take state argument 
update transactions treated exactly actions ai planning domain transactions functions 
section illustrates approach representation databases transactions situation calculus 
basic approach specifying database transactions example consider toy education database illustrate approach specifying update transactions 
relations database involves relations 
enrolled st course student st enrolled course course database state 
grade st course grade grade student st course course grade database state 
pre course pre prerequisite course course course 
notice relation state independent expected change evolution database 
initial database state assume order specification true initial state database 
arbitrary order sentences restriction predicates mention state mention initial state incomplete initial database states permitted 
examples information true initial state enrolled sue enrolled sue enrolled bill enrolled bill enrolled mary enrolled john

database transactions update transactions denoted function symbols treated exactly actions situation calculus 
example transactions 
register st course register student st course course 

change st course grade change current grade student st course course grade 

drop st course student st drops course course 
transaction preconditions normally transactions preconditions satisfied current database state transaction executed 
example possible register student course iff obtained grade prerequisites course oss register st oe grade st possible change student grade iff grade different new grade oss change st grade st student may drop course iff student currently enrolled course oss drop st enrolled st update specifications axioms specify effects transactions database relations oss register st oe enrolled st register st oss drop st oe enrolled st drop st oss change st oe grade st change st known planning literature mccarthy hayes axioms sufficient correctly specify database futures frame axioms specifying relations left invariant transaction provided 
defer proposing frame axioms section mean time assume provided conjunction update specification axioms 
integrity constraints revisited recall integrity constraint specifies counts legal database state property database state satisfy 
accordingly natural represent order sentences universally quantified states 
example may different grades course database state st grade st grade st oe personnel database require salaries decrease evolution database sal sal oe intuitions lead definition constraint satisfaction database satisfies integrity constraint ic iff database entails constraint database ic happens state constraints arise context ramification problem finger lin shoham exactly character database integrity constraints identical treatment

summary reasons wanting prove properties states situation calculus having reasoning physical world showing plan exists certain planning problems third verifying integrity constraints databases 
general shall assume situation calculus axiomatization distinguished initial state axiomatization objective prove properties states accessible finite sequence possible actions definition contrasted reiter 
unitary concept integrity constraint database theory subtleties involved 
example sentences 
notice sentences universally quantified states contrast standard theorem proving account plan synthesis green requires proofs sentences existentially quantified states 
surprisingly proving universally quantified sentences requires mathematical induction 
just form induction principles take subject section 
formulating suitable induction axioms close analogy situation calculus theory natural numbers simply identify natural number add successor natural number effect axiomatization situation calculus theory natural number arbitrarily successors
