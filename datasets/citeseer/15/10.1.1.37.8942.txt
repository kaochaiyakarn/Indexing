motivation web mining data mining techniques automatically discover extract information world wide web documents services line travel agents job listings electronic malls 
article considers question effective web mining possible 
believe web unstructured web mining succeed 
data mining applied databases traditionally information web lies buried documents designed human consumption home pages product catalogs 
furthermore information web natural language text machine readable semantics html annotations structure display web pages provide little insight content 
advocated transforming web massive layered database facilitate data mining web dynamic chaotic manner 
attempted hand code site specific wrappers facilitate extraction information individual web resources 
hand coding convenient keep explosive growth web 
alternative article argues structured web hypothesis information web sufficiently structured facilitate effective web mining 
examples web structure include linguistic typographic conventions html annotations title classes semi structured documents product catalogs web indices directories 
support structured web hypothesis article survey preliminary web mining successes suggest directions 
web mining may decomposed subtasks 
resource discovery locating unfamiliar documents services web 

information extraction automatically extracting specific information newly discovered web resources 

generalization uncovering general patterns individual web sites multiple sites 
consider task turn 
resource discovery web resources fall classes documents services 
bulk resource discovery focuses automatic creation searchable indices web documents 
popular indices created web robots webcrawler alta vista scan millions web documents store index words documents 
person ask indexed documents contain certain keywords 
dozen different indices currently active unique interface database covering different fraction web 
result people forced repeatedly try retry queries different indices 
furthermore indices return responses irrelevant outdated unavailable forcing person manually sift responses searching useful information 
metacrawler www metacrawler com represents level information food chain providing single unified interface web document searching 
metacrawler expressive query language allows searching phrases restricting search geographic region internet domain gov 
metacrawler posts keyword queries searchable indices parallel prunes responses returned aiming provide users manageable amount high quality information 
tackling web directly metacrawler mines robot created searchable indices 
resource discovery systems automatic text categorization technology classify web documents categories 
technology facilitate automatic construction web directories yahoo discovering documents fit yahoo categories 
alternatively technology filter results queries searchable indices 
example response query find product reviews discovery system take documents containing word querying searchable indices identify subset corresponds product reviews 
information food chain metaphor elaborated web robots viewed metacrawler information carnivore 
information extraction web resource discovered challenge automatically extract information 
bulk today information extraction systems identify fixed set web resources rely hand coded wrappers access resource parse response 
scale growth web web miners need dynamically extract information unfamiliar resources eliminating reducing need hand coding 
survey systems 
harvest system relies models semi structured documents improve ability extract information 
example knows find author title information latex documents strip position information postscript files 
demonstration harvest created directory toll free numbers extracting large set web documents see harvest cs colorado edu harvest html 
harvest discovers new documents learns new models document structure 
harvest easily handles new documents familiar type 
faq finders extract answers frequently asked questions faqs faq files available web 
harvest rely model document structure 
people pose question natural language text question search faq files matching question faq finder returns answer associated matching question 
semi structured nature files number files smaller number documents world wide web faq finders potential return higher quality information general purpose searchable indices 
harvest faq finder key limitations 
systems focus exclusively web documents ignore services holds web indices 
second harvest faq finder rely pre specified description certain fixed classes web documents 
contrast internet learning agent ila shopbot web miners described rely combination test queries domain specific knowledge automatically learn descriptions web services searchable product catalogs personnel directories 
learned descriptions enable automatic information extraction intelligent agents internet softbot 
ila learns extract information unfamiliar resources querying familiar objects matching output returned knowledge query objects 
example ila queries university washington personnel directory etzioni recognizes third output token phone number 
observation ila hypothesize third token output directory phone number person mentioned query 
learning process number subtleties 
example output token oren etzioni userid name 
discriminate competing hypotheses ila attempt query userid different name 
experiments reported ila successfully learned extract information phone numbers mail addresses internet server whois personnel directories dozen universities 
shopbot learns extract product information web vendors 
shopbot borrows ila idea learning querying familiar objects 
shopbot tackles ambitious task 
shopbot takes input address store home page knowledge product domain software learns shop store 
specifically shopbot searches store web find store searchable product catalog learns format product descriptions learns extract product attributes price descriptions 
shopbot learns querying store information popular products analyzing store responses 
software shopping domain shopbot home pages line software vendors 
shopbot learned extract product information stores including product operating system mac windows 
preliminary user study shopbot users able shop times faster find better prices 
users relying web browser 
current shopbot explores problem autonomously discovering vendor home pages 
generalization automated discovery extraction information web sites natural step attempt generalize experience 
virtually machine learning systems deployed web see examples learn user interests learning web 
major obstacle learning web labeling problem data abundant web unlabeled 
data mining techniques require inputs labeled positive negative examples concept 
example relatively straight forward take large set web pages labeled positive negative examples concept home page derive classifier predicts web page home page unfortunately web pages unlabeled 
techniques uncertainty sampling reduce amount labeled data needed eliminate labeling problem 
clustering techniques require labeled inputs applied successfully large collections documents 
web offers fertile ground document clustering research 
clustering techniques take weaker unlabeled inputs data mining techniques produce weaker unlabeled output 
consider approach solving labeling problem relies observation web collection linked documents 
web interactive medium visited millions people day
