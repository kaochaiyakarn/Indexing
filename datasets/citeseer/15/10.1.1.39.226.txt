combining narratives john mccarthy computer science department stanford university stanford ca tom costello computer science department stanford university stanford ca theory elaboration tolerant extent new information incorporated simple changes 
simplest change conjoining new information conjunctive changes considered 
general adding information theory change just enlarge consequences requires reasoning non monotonic 
theories narratives accounts sets events necessarily sequences 
narrative elaboration tolerant extent new events detail existing events added just adding sentences 
propose new version situation calculus allows information added easily 
particular events concurrent described events introduced modifying existing descriptions detail events added 
major benefit narratives interact consistently conjoined 
objectives situation calculus logical approach ai mcc mcc computer program represents knows world general knows situation goals sentences mathematical logical language 
program infers logically action appropriate achieving goal 
widely known nonmonotonic inference included 
actions program perform include generate sentences means logical inference observation world special purpose non logical problem solvers 
simpler behaviors actions controlled reflexes integrated logic 
actions decided logic include adjusting parameters ongoing reflexive actions 
person decide walk faster reasons late require reason control step walking 
situation calculus aspect logic approach ai 
situation snapshot world instant 
situations rich objects possible completely describe situation say things 
facts situations general laws effects actions events possible infer situations 
situation calculus discussed mcc mh widely read 
formalization action situation calculus kinds problem narrative planning prediction 
narrative simplest humans 
narrative account happened 
treat giving situations events facts relations 
situations narrative partially ordered time 
real situations totally ordered narrative may include full information ordering 
temporal relations situations need described extent needed describe interactions 
situations occurring entirely different places give obvious examples actions person place may interact far inferences draw 
protect flank rod brooks 
rich situations approximate partial objects 
idea developed 
hypothetical situations need totally ordered situation oswald missed kennedy past 
state traveler certain flight reads book drinks coca cola humans don need know temporal relations events interact 
situation calculus originally envisaged events mainly actions situation produce situations result 
original theory envisage event occurring situation envisage intermediate situations events occur 
rarely people write axioms possibilities just took advantage 
formalism doesn really change basic formalism situation calculus just takes advantage fact original formalism allows treating concurrent events concurrent events originally supposed formalism 
gelfond lifschitz glr treat concurrent events different way propose 
narrative necessary said hold situation logical consequence said hold previous situation known common sense facts effects events 
place stories new facts situations added benjamin franklin arrived london raining 
second place event tossing coin outcome non monotonic preference 
interpreting formalizations regard situations rich objects events poor 
fact inclined take deterministic view single narrative 
principle event occurs situation fact situations inevitable consequence facts situation 
fact situation coin tossed comes tails 
facts occasionally consequences facts situation aware narrative 
narrative easy clear facts included narrative assertions inferable narrative 
basic model handles basic features 
reiter rei write axioms 
narratives anomalous 
record junior flew moscow situation mentioned assert reader feel left 
want introduce concept proper narrative narrative anomalies 
fluents holding new situation reasonable outcomes events reported fluents newly asserted raining london franklin arrived 
elaboration tolerant reasoning formalization phenomenon elaboration tolerant extent permits elaborations description requiring completely redoing basis formalization 
particular unfortunate change predicate symbols 
ideally elaboration achieved adding sentences changing sentences 
add sentences need form non monotonic reasoning 
want add information previously assumed false 
non monotonicity get inconsistency 
concentrate easier case need non monotonicity 
natural language descriptions phenomena elaboration tolerant existing formalizations 
major kinds elaboration tolerance examine 
non interacting events allowing addition description second phenomenon doesn interact 
case drawn combined narrative just conjunction component narratives 
infer obvious consequences events need assume events occur 
major novelty assume events occur 
state events cause event narrative fail 
narrative stacking blocks state block moving actions mentioned 
block stacking narrative say traveling events occur 
narrative traveling claims block stacking events happen 
allows narratives consistently conjoined 
previous proposals conjoin narratives assumed events happened picked result function assumed events occurred mentioned 
detail events add details event 
airplane glasgow london junior read book coca cola 
assumption relevant events precisely actions move blocks mentioned narrative occur 
blocks stacked narrative new york 
theory context interpret statement blocks narrative statement blocks new york 
happen elaborate adding event long compatible said 
notion relevant formalized carefully apparent elaborate particular event sequence smaller events 
buy 
took shelf put counter paid clerk took home 
narrative just mentions buying exclude particular elaboration 
elaborate way don want exclude subsequent elaboration component events elaborating paying clerk offering bill change formalism allows details event added conjoining extra sentences 
modifying situation calculus formalisms situation calculus mccarthy hayes mh event calculus kowalski ks represent reason changing world sha 
formalisms exactly needed represent kind narratives wish consider 
situation calculus limited version allow represent events occur explicitly sequence events assumed occur 
specify particular sequence events occurs introducing predicate actual true just sequence situations occur ideal forces decide events happened earlier name events happen 
reason modified situation calculus adding new predicate occurs states events occur 
function result serving purposes stating occurred designating resulting situation split functions 
keep result denotes result doing occurs occur value function arbitrary situation adds event calculus style presentation underlying situation calculus formalism 
particular allows specify sequence events making claims events may happened 
ontology situations reiter suggested situations situation calculus defined axiomatically 
suggests pinto reiter pr 
choose result partial function introduces difficulties partial functions 
axioms result result result ind result determine equality situations relative equality events actions 
axioms categorical relative interpretation equality actions unique model situations 
axioms state situations exist result choose say situations ordered predicate strict partial order axiomatize follows 
result predicate similar predicate introduced mh true find useful write infix notation non strict version 
useful write specifying effects events situation calculus usual specify effects actions writing effect axioms holds loaded holds dead result shoot move formalism allows events occur result way specifying change needs adjusted 
possible occur time result shoot causes event different result 
reason natural allow preconditions things hold left hand side mention properties times result shoot 
previous versions situation calculus preconditions event modeled set fluents fluents hold event effect result 
allow things reiter notation differ uses result 
shorthand reiter writes customary logical write holds dead saying dead 
suppose events occur context lifting rules exist dead outer context 
outer context may contain preconditions shooter 
happen event just specify preconditions hold event 
consider plane journey glasgow london 
necessary plane working order entire flight 
necessary glasgow flight clearly need precondition persist entire flight 
necessary ticket airline steward takes 
example precondition having ticket hold just moment event starts entire duration 
consider example yale shooting problem 
order successfully shoot person gun loaded trigger pulled target remain cross hairs bullet hits 
represent fact target cross hairs aimed 
write occurs shoot holds loaded result shoot holds aimed holds dead result shoot possible objection example target arrives cross hairs time impact remains path bullet killed 
case write occurs shoot holds loaded result shoot result shoot holds aimed holds dead result shoot examples show need preconditions richer statement properties hold just event occurs 
possible properties occur preconditions important wish know kinds axioms occur effect axioms 
consider represent preconditions recall represented possible preconditions earlier 
wish introduce predicate parameterize effect axioms old fashioned situation calculus write changes def holds holds holds result cos 
predicate fluents encodes preconditions 
parameterizing effect axioms allows minimize effect axioms easily 
want preconditions extend duration event need set fluents 
reason allow preconditions slightly abuse notation write holds holds predicate fluents 
sets fluents 
set need hold start event persist entire event 
model preconditions need hold part duration event 
model defined fluents 
write necessary ticket airline steward takes new fluent defined holds holds ticket holds steward ticket fluent hold entire duration flight 
shorthand result holds 
write necessary plane working order entire flight fluent fly fly holds result fly add necessary glasgow flight holds fly fly holds result fly preconditions represented sets redefine changes follows changes def holds holds holds result find useful introduce predicate succeeds defined changes holds frame axioms usually write frame axiom fluent say top block top block action case shoot holds top holds top result shoot entire duration taken including endpoint 
natural endpoint needed precondition 
write general formula variable glasgow 
assume fluent function holds holds absence fluent function need sets positive fluents negative fluents 
result longer encodes events occurred need say event change fluent top occurred interval top held top hold notable needs notion changes introduced 
write frame axiom result occurs succeeds holds holds generate frame axioms minimize changes varying succeeds holds allowing domain vary cos cos 
consider non monotonic reasoning minimize changes wish stress issues 
explicitly axiomatize result minimization way reiter rei uses explanation closure axiom explicit statement events change fluents 
events occur 
consider combining narratives address problem arises new formalism earlier versions situation calculus 
frame axioms allow carry simple reasoning carry previous versions situation calculus 
need know certain events occur 
consider example moving block 
action moves block move block successfully clear 
instance puts block top block moving action fail 
effect axiom states moving block block succeeds clear entire duration equal move top top clear top holds clear top holds top result able holds result example need facts world appendix 
told block table action moving top occurred situation 
holds top able occurs move top write frame axiom case move top result occurs succeeds top holds top holds top states block block situation long event moving moving top occurs successful 
writers think event change fluent occurs fails fluent undetermined 
weaken frame axiom event moving block fails block clear 
write result occurs move changes move top holds top holds top general shall prefer stronger frame axiom 
wish prove holds top result move top prove weaker move top clear clear holds top result need prove remain clear move action order show action successful 
show remain clear need frame axiom 
prove block remains clear successful move action move top occurs result result move 
allow situations imagine move progress placed block just 
explicitly state action put occurred interval save course need state event result lies interval action putting top move top occurs result result move top move top occurs result result move top prove holds top result move top principal allows prove clear entire interval 
prove remains table may events put top blocks 
events unclear block action putting prove remains table need occurs move result move result move notable need state actions occurred 
sufficed say events occurred cause precondition event narrative fail 
notion need state certain events occur important wish axiomatize domains way allow conjoined 
fact motivating property developing new axiomatization allow separate axiomatizations interfere conjoined 
possible old style situation calculus explicitly list sequence actions occurs 
possible state events occur mentioned done narrative reasoning 
reasoning significantly difficult usual reasoning situation calcu endpoints 
especially checking preconditions events need show effect strictly need show need show 
state events happen monotonically 
statements inferred sentences tell occurrences fluents explicitly stated occur hold narrative axiomatization changes 
fluent relevant precondition effect stated event occurs fluent value stated narrative 
gives notion relevant fluents events terms fluents events explicitly narrative 
state events occur change effects relevant fluents 
avoid explaining reasoning machinery currently quite complex 
lus 
needed check conditions blocks remained clear strategies goal regression rei continue effective 
events multiple effects general event may effect 
preconditions effect may differ preconditions may parameterized effect 
furthermore effect may occur different time 
extending result effect event write result time main effect result time effect changing instance flying glasgow london resulting situation situation arrive london 
effect event longer ticket air takes 
situation takes ticket picked result fly glasgow lhr steward ticket
