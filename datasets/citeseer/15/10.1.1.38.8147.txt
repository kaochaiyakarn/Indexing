role user modelling phelps seen section user modelling heart phelps 
section details phelps approach user modelling 
user model contains information ranging task specific knowledge profiles showing tasks peer helper perform level capability carrying coarse finegrained step tasks general peer helper age gender position csc linguistic fluency current login status number times peer helper provided help 
information user model changes time ranging fine grained temporal intervals minutes hours login status carry particular task step longer periods days weeks learning new task months years changing position csc 
user model multi dimensional principle axes temporal task relatedness 
task relatedness dimension explicitly hierarchical natural topography various task hierarchies see 
temporal dimension implicit particular information knowledge profile time 
phelps concern initially user model peer helper maintaining accuracy user model time 
initial knowledge acquisition user models done filling questionnaire workers wish peer helper roster 
user model maintenance particularly difficult general purpose time varying information login status number times peer helper dispensed help information gleaned system merely tracking logins counting help sessions 
difficult changes task specific information tracked 
initial knowledge acquisition tracking primary responsibility peer helpers 
phelps approach support task specific knowledge maintenance ways 
carry various tasks peer helpers encouraged phelps check task steps see section proceed step step task 
marking checklists reifies task steps mind peer helper useful reinforcement activity just time training task provide sort temporal extension peer helper user model recording current state problem solving 
second support provided phelps peer helpers keep knowledge profiles date product peer help session 
peer helpers helped inspect knowledge profiles order better understand facilitate communication mutual interaction ensues clarify inaccuracies profiles parties 
collins seen major responsibility phelps users carry profile maintenance activities 
fact solve problems user model maintenance usually prove difficult user student modelling applications huang 
suggest users help maintain user models see paiva order context right 
widespread phelps organization encourage workers ensure accuracy user models maintained 
want keep date record capabilities various tasks need help targeted appropriately take account strengths weaknesses ii contact help contacted topics know 
short inaccurate user model cost worker time seeking help sought help 
user model maintenance proves problematic hope natural extensions carried help maintaining knowledge profiles 
users prove unwilling check task steps fine grain size willing coarse grain size possible infer fine grained steps known coarse grained ones 
users prove unwilling check task steps carry tasks hyper links task hierarchies oms system traversed reverse update task hierarchy inference particular activities carried oms 
may require recognition diagnosis methodologies artificial intelligence 
methodologies far removed easy applicability domain task specificity activities carried oms allow reasonable adaptation methodologies granularity recognition scent mccalla greer model knowledge tracing lisp tutor corbett anderson explicitly designed task specific real world domains 
addition multi dimensional user models phelps multi purpose 
principal purpose help find appropriate set peer helpers anybody needing help particular task 
primary requirement met choice appropriate helper find peer knows task particular task step person needs help 
secondary requirements person available time frame help required person asked help past 
primary requirement fulfilled algorithm matches current task hierarchy checklist worker needing help knowledge profiles potential peer helpers 
matching function currently operates constraint solver considers subtask step help requested sibling subtasks subsequent subtasks higher level parent subtasks 
subtasks set best candidate helpers computed ability help function returns list helpers exceed certain threshold 
hoppe terms hoppe peers chosen complementarity criterion peer high competence chosen help 
note hoppe learning domain workplace environment choosing peers competitiveness criterion effective 
research may investigate incorporating information taken longer term knowledge profile person needing help just checklist 
list returned profile matching function pruned removing peer helpers available secondary requirements 
inspectable user models just time workplace training remaining list potential peer helpers person needing help 
second purpose user models important having person needing help scan knowledge profiles potential peer helpers order choose somebody specific combination qualities prefer 
qualities may involve peer helper having particular pattern task knowledge may involve task specific characteristics having gender approximately age similar position job title union 
literature collaborative collaborative learning suggests characteristics important facilitating effective collaboration dillenbourg 
regardless statistical trends believe important leave worker needing help decide important current context 
third purpose user models dual second purpose giving peer helper contacted ability look knowledge profile worker needing help task hierarchy checklist represents worker current state task completion 
peer helper right refuse help 
decide help worker profile task hierarchy checklist helper profile form basis mutual understanding parties
