important objects designed navigators choose landmarks 
issues regarding way landmarks constructed 
issue relates landmark physical features 
issue relates ways landmarks distinctive 
landmark features designer opportunity create landmarks noticeable help navigators remember positions environment 
landmarks support possibly development survey knowledge 
instance navigator determine position environment knowledge position landmarks 
consequently particular features designing landmarks support navigation 
evans colleagues expanding kaplan empirically examined relationship note lynch refers items elements reserves specific meaning term landmark see table 
term landmark generally refer lynch elements features environment provide information navigator position orientation 
building features recall 
studies produced set features building memorable set features building location easier recall 
features sets enhance building distinctiveness see table guideline 
evans colleagues functions buildings socio cultural significance surrounding traffic patterns affect memorability 
types features difficult reproduce 
guideline landmarks distinctive features tables 
table building features contributing memorability 
significant height complex shape bright exterior large visible signs expensive building materials maintenance free standing visible lm increases memorability building 
improves memory building location 
surrounded unique exterior color texture guideline concrete objects ones landmarks 
study landmarks suggests memorable landmarks increase navigability 
landmarks consisting familiar objects model car fork easier navigate

felt objects easier remember art accounted difference navigability 
table landmarks natural environments

important remember distinctiveness object crucial factor serving landmark 
consequently important apply features tables selectively 
section issue distinctiveness explored 
distinctiveness guideline landmark easy distinguish nearby objects landmarks 
guideline sides landmark differ 
objects intended serve landmarks distinctive ways 
distinctive regard nearby objects 
accordingly evans colleagues note building stands street significantly remembered 
second landmark easy distinguish landmarks especially nearby ones 
navigator confuse landmark result select wrong navigational action wrong turn 
error common sport orienteering involves navigation natural environments name parallel error 
third sides landmark differ 
differences help navigators determine orientation 
contrast consider pine tree fairly symmetrical vertical axis 
symmetry tree looks facing east west direction plane 
consequently navigators tree determine orientation vertical axis yaw 
knowing orientation selecting direction travel reach destination impossible 
navigation wandering impossible 
accordingly informal observation navigators revealed superiority asymmetrical landmarks supporting navigation 
guideline landmark distinctiveness increased placing objects nearby 
single object distinctive pair objects may suffice 
consider radially symmetrical pine tree 
due tree symmetry vertical axis difficult tell direction viewing 
inserting tree viewing direction disambiguated 
direction front tree 
opposite direction tree hides 
viewed direction tree left viewed opposite direction tree right 
technique differentiate views directions falling horizontal axes 
differentiate similar landmarks 
need insert different object near landmark 
designer keep mind difficult navigators determine positions orientations circumstances 
objects spatial relationships considered order determine viewpoint orientation position 
processing required single object provides unambiguous position orientation information 
additional processing required objects probably difficult navigators estimate positions orientations objects 
navigators observed relying configurations landmarks obtain orientation information 
guideline landmarks carry common element distinguish group data objects 
consider ves features constrained underlying data human system 
objects ves serve landmarks possible assist navigation augmenting additional objects function landmarks 
navigators easily recognize objects landmarks realize landmarks 
continue example navigators take artificial landmark blood cell 
navigators develop misconceptions blood cells motion position shape 
consequently ves important landmarks carry common element distinguishes virtual objects 
instance artificial landmarks system appear solid angular truck contrast soft objects shown travelling blood

minimizing distortions cognitive maps term cognitive map misleading suggests mental representations environments images 
reality cognitive maps contain features image 
cognitive maps contain categorical hierarchical structures spatial distortions represented image 
distance asymmetry example distortion 
distance asymmetry involves representing different distances points distance different distance 
distances represented single image 
people cognitive maps navigate distortions cognitive maps confusing lead navigational errors 
distortions warp navigator understanding data represented data objects 
reasons important minimize distortions 
studies shown distortions diminish increased navigational experience 
possible structure environment minimize development distortions place 
requires understanding types distortions causes 
accordingly followed examination design guidelines 
sources distortions distortions result hierarchical structure cognitive maps 
hierarchies formed clustering objects fall identifiable boundaries form districts see table 
instance cities state district form cluster 
objective boundaries clusters form anchor points important landmarks 
multi level hierarchy develop districts clustered higher level 
example hierarchy induced distortion provided stevens coupe 
participants experiment reported san diego california west reno nevada 
response resulted inference hierarchical relationship cities containing states 
people reasoned san diego california reno nevada california west nevada san diego west reno 
distances distorted 
people underestimate distances objects district overestimating distances objects different districts 
sum cognitive map hierarchies produce distortions relative directions distances 
distortions produced mental heuristics help remember layout objects 
heuristic aligns main axes nearby objects 
main axes provided object shape salient features 
example people drew map palo alto california showing familiar streets parallel reality 
heuristic rotate object relative background object main axes line background 
example residents ume sweden northern direction corresponded ume street grid 
tversky speculates environment axes axes ume street grid provide possible framework construct type hierarchy described 
notes alignment rotation heuristics responsible rectilinear normalization tendency distort environmental features grid 
sum hierarchical structures tversky heuristics explain distortions cognitive maps 
understanding distortions come design ves minimize 
guidelines doing discussed section 
grid guideline arrange paths edges see table form grid 
guideline align landmarks main axes path edge grid main axes 
guideline align landmark main axes landmarks 
minimize distortions designer create induces hierarchical representation districts form grid 
consequence grid spatial regularity spatial relationships districts approximation spatial relationships objects districts 
instance district left district objects left objects consequently judgments relative positions objects distorted judgments spatial relationships districts 
shows theoretical direction distortions districts forming grid irregular shape 
irregular districts correspond california nevada example coupe study discussed previously 
grid structure produces distortions smaller produced irregular structure 
cognitive map direction distortions grid form irregular districts 
grid form districts irregular districts distortion direction objects accordingly shown distance direction judgements accurate environments street grids 
question encourage navigator construct grid representation 
appears people cues environment structure spatial hierarchies 
consequently designer arrange environment paths edges form grid 
landmark main axes aligned landmarks main axes path edge grid 
reinforce grid 
substantially reduce distortions due rotation alignment 
landmarks aligned navigator need bring alignment distorting position
