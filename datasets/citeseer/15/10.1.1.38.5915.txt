notice recursive mapping set genetic instructions contained original cell may control transitions differing contexts various cells cause different genetic instructions applied different cells 
result genetic instructions determine steps final steps developing process 
changes due mutations genetic operators different genetic instructions cause different effects 
changes affect fundamental initial steps development process drastic consequences changes affect developmental stages dramatic consequences resulting phenotype 
example particular non terminal cell responsible generation successive mitosis differentiation processes entire functional group terminal cells individual additional group cells type may easily emerge successive generations small changes genotype 
resulting individual duplicated functional group cells may win competition additional group cells happens adaptive function may successively modified order assume adaptive function pre adaptation 
example drastic change change affects early stages development may result viable individual addition may allow sudden emergence new structured character apparently require accumulation huge set evolutionary changes
