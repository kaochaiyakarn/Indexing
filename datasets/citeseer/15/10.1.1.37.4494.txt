underlying interpretation compound semantic category concept typed lambda abstraction 
lambda abstraction proven useful writing function expressions application allows functions defined 
simple example typed lambda expression nat nat nat nat nat nat representing identity function natural numbers

description dimensions part metadata repository 
text warehouse just data metadata keeps changing 
goal capture dynamics dimensions conceptual model 
accomplish task introducing meta snowflake schema snowflake schema category index table added 
index table contains metadata dimensions atomic semantic categories compound semantic categories label documents stored warehouse
