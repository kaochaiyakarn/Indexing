low level image analysis filtering approach gp image analysis idea low level image analysis tasks image enhancement feature detection image segmentation re framed image filtering problems gp discover optimal filters solve problems 
image enhancement case image enhancement objective improve actual quality image example removing noise reducing blurring due optics camera

image segmentation general image segmentation consists labelling pixels image small number labels pixels belonging regions homogeneous gray level label pixels belonging regions significantly different gray level different labels ballard brown 
techniques available literature solve problem 
number consider problem segmenting image pixel classification problem pixel assigned class considering local information usually gray levels pixels neighborhood pixel classified information derived 
number classes known advance images available neural networks statistical classification techniques purpose 
case neural networks approach net outputs class assign pixel class output neuron maximally active different nets single output number classes select class net provides maximum output 
cases input neurons pixels neighborhood net kind non linear filter possibly multiple outputs 
quite practical applications objective segmentation specific difficult achieve label pixels belonging structures interest foreground rest background conspicuous intra class inhomogeneities inter class similarities 
cases segmentation possible requires exploitation statistical information gray levels structures interest possibly importantly large scale regularities typical shape structures interest 
regularities captured giving filter information contained large neighborhoods pixels 
gp image analysis noted problems mentioned previous section image segmentation difficult standard filtering techniques particular linear fir iir filters usually provide insufficient discriminative power reliable classification 
methods capable considering available sources information combining strongly non linear way artificial neural networks ad hoc combinations filters able give relatively results 
neural networks operators offer peculiar kinds non linearities 
relatively performance derives large neighborhoods presence non linearities arguable larger space methods exists features 
space explored unbiased machinelearning technique genetic programming impose specific form non linearity fixed shape neighborhoods 
gp discover efficient optimal filters image analysis order search feasible effective terminal sets function sets fitness functions meet certain requirements 
terminal set idea gp image filtering successively pixel classification nn strategy variables number pixels neighborhood fixed size apply filter run program pixel image appropriately shifting neighborhood run 
variables represent gray level pixels neighborhood current pixel 
output program root node taken output filter 
approach presents problems 
reason neighborhoods modest size lead large terminal set including tens hundreds variables 
consequence large scale statistical information necessary determine correct output filter gp build large sub programs order extract information 
serious impact computation load memory requirements imposed gp ultimately feasibility approach 
sets terminals image analysis meet requirements ffl include limited number variables maintain size search space amenable 
ffl capable capturing information image different scales conjunction function set 
ffl run gp process binding variables evaluation program require complex calculations fitness functions image analysis see include thousands fitness cases 
ideal set require memory accesses 
possible example operations necessary evaluate terminals performed initialization phase gp results stored separate arrays 
ffl efficiency programs discovered gp sought computation load necessary evaluate aforementioned arrays light possible 
experiments reported various combinations functions terminals tried difficulties afore mentioned terminal set 
requirements met different sets terminals third fourth constrain considerably possible choice 
example simple terminal set satisfies requirements shown table gray level pixel coordinates coordinates current pixel center neighborhood terminals value taken convolution image box operators constant masks different sizes 
set terminals features ffl includes terminals 
ffl captures fine scale broader scale information 
conjunction shifting macros described section provides full information see ffl moving averages computed efficiently initialization phase algorithm requiring additions division pixel 
stored appropriate arrays evaluation runtime requires memory access 
function set addition usual closure sufficiency properties efficiency requirements similar terminal sets apply function sets image analysis 
closure easy achieve sufficiency ensured especially problems exact solution filter known 
necessary step sufficiency functions extract information contained image available terminal set 
order meet efficiency requirements cases necessary include functions perform real image processing operations 
reason computation performed functions depend values arguments 
values may vary considerably different programs different parts single program importantly pixel pixel 
result impossible pre compute store values returned functions 
evaluation fitness individual may require computation load orders magnitude bigger image processing functions 
function set meets requirements shown table dummy arguments 
worth noting macros xcp allow construction filters complexity provided terminal set 
addition presence min max div mul allows construction known image processing combining properly shifted scaled box operators filter including gaussian filters derivatives terminals name definition random random constant generator dx gamma dy gamma dx gamma dy gamma dx gamma dy gamma

highly non linear filters mathematical morphology operators 
operations conjunction add sub allow creation necessary constants 
fitness functions objective develop filters image enhancement possible symbolic regression fitness function output program location compared desired output 
sum absolute errors program pixels images training set transformed fitness function usual scaling mapping techniques 
availability desired output images huge number gamma runs necessary evaluate fitness program hamper approach 
second problem reduced considerably sampling images training set say gamma random points running program locations problem remains hand gaussian laplacian filters approximated desired degree accuracy 
unacceptable real world images 
solution expensive filtering techniques say kalman filter different image acquisition technologies provide desired output 
objective develop filters feature detection image segmentation symbolic regression fitness function forces output program exactly match binary values representing structures segmented detected set training images inappropriate 
reasons 
reason output filter passed decision algorithms cases simply apply threshold order decision class assign pixel 
computational effort spent gp build programs binary outputs unnecessary case 
search gp considerably easier wrapper filtering program simply sets output filter output positive 
second reason sensitivity specificity dilemma poli valli segmentation detection algorithm face real world images algorithm detect segment points belonging structures interest true positives tps wrongly detecting points belong uninteresting structures false positives fps missing points false negatives fns 
algorithm sensitivity number tps divided number points detected specificity number true negatives divided number points detected smaller 
changing settings parameters algorithm increase specificity decrease sensitivity viceversa 
optimum setting algorithm usually sensitivity specificity big possible 
fitness function symbolic regression essentially sum number fps fns fp fn fixed training set fp fn determine sensitivity specificity program 
optimizing sum necessarily mean achieve optimum sensitivity specificity trade 
contrary experiments fitness function shown cases gp tend discover algorithms sensitive poorly specific vice versa 
unfortunately optimising sensitivity specificity tradeoff quite difficult depending particular detection task fps fns completely different impact quality results 
example tasks may totally unacceptable false detections fps better false detections sake simplicity term fitness mean cost quantity minimised 
simple change sign transform 
fitness function fp fn tends behave slightly better give acceptable results number pixels detected smaller pixels image 
original images head 
misses fns think example detection breast 
experience fitness function best results fp fn exp fn gamma ff number pixels belonging structures detected ff domain dependent parameter represents maximum percentage misses number misses considered unacceptable typically ff gamma 
basically fn sufficiently smaller ff fp gp tries minimize number false detections 
fn slightly bigger ff fn exp fn gamma ff gp tries minimize number misses

figures show output produced nets 
despite large number degrees freedom networks smaller net larger presence single image pair training set segmentation training set shown figures looks disappointing nets
