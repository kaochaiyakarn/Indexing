ontology domain conceptualization sets forth terminology may relations hold concepts terms denote 
way sure things happen develop single ontology single set terms domain require communicating parties ontology dialogue 
call single ontology proposal 
reality various agents different terms denote elements common domain presents pervasive problem words agent ontology completely unintelligible agent agreed common language communication interlingua ahead time ontologies similar significantly overlapping 
problem occurs agents ontologies designed different purposes 
reject single ontology proposal impossible implement designers ontologies agree terminology

advocate approach agent designers free ontology sense problems terminology arise solved ontological mediator 
vocabulary suppose agent agent want communicate domain

relation truly ontological matter opinion example kind subclass superclass relation pair form taxonomic hierarchy 
hierarchical generalizers specializers hierarchical ontological relation ontological relation organizes concepts hierarchy taxonomy similar structure 
hierarchical relations related distinct transitive relations

hierarchical ontological relations important ontological mediation form hierarchies organizing concepts ontology 
relation hierarchical think having direction orientation generalizer relating concept concepts superconcepts moving hierarchy specializer relating concept concepts subconcepts moving
