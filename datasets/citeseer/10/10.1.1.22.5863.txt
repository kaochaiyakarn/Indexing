example set ribosome binding sequences aligned translational initiation point 
table frequencies base position constructed 
frequency table examined individual position sorted frequency bases 
frequent base called consensus base appears top final graphic commonly represent pattern sequence 
consensus sequence represent information sequences cases bases appear significant frequency 
example initiation codon predominantly aug gug occasion 
ignores possibilities distorted data 
reasons consensus sequence poor model binding sites 
importance particular position binding site clearly consistently information required describe pattern 
choose symbol state equally possibilities requires bit information 
example communicate result coin flip requires bit information question needs answered heads 
position binding site contains base need exactly bits information questions need answered 


answers questions 
furthermore position contains bases question suffices choice equivalent choice 
bit needed describe position binding site contains bits needed describe position contains adenine 
frequencies bases exactly equi probable sophisticated calculation needed find average information position
