sign triads object correspond notions individual sign triad 
object corresponds entity external world prototypical representative entity perceived remembered reflected individual agent 
called external entity 
entity kind unit physical imagined object emotion sensory perception experience observed imagined relation remembered event situation 
external entity attributes features characteristics perceived individual 
complete list features usually generated may impossible generated general 
corresponds mental internal representation sign individual mind 
internal representation form words language form computer form visual tactile sensory representations 
internal representations individually defined human agents study belongs realm psychology 
corresponds called actual context 
notion context difficult 
example international conferences context years 
papers proceedings contain research modeling applications context philosophical linguistic implications context essentially attempts definitions precise descriptions context 
context similarly situation situation theory ultimately define contexts gives indication formalize describe 
general accepted convention necessarily constitutes context 
assumed actual context contains information individual agent time space social rules describe appropriateness internal representation external entity 
contexts nested 
context distinct subcontexts example individual reflects entities currently 
case subcontext related external entity originally encountered subcontext current physical mental context individual 
aspects information representation processing related consensual sign natural artificial languages 
apart user usability issues course important relevant individual triad ignored information representation formalisms 
main reason mentioning individual triad explicitly state external objects actual contexts internal representations directly contained consensual sign triad 
consensual sign triad second important triad consensual sign triad 
elements consensual triad directly concerned actual experiences 
elements easier formalize formation consensual sign system natural language relies implicit standardization rules 
relationships constituents consensual triad expected follow regularities 
consensual sign triad consists conceptual entity object position consensual context position sign representation position defined follows 
conceptual entity kind unit physical object concept conceptual relation situation event process 
conceptual entities concepts best represented formal representation system fca cgs 
consensual context conceptual entities exten sion set exemplary prototypical instances intension list attributes logical constraints 
conceptual entities instances attributes usually represented natural formal language considered language independent 
concepts may arise specific cultural linguistic context 
may possible translate concepts single word phrase usually possible sufficiently describe concepts languages help explanations providing background information 
example german notions bunt gem considered lexical gaps english meaning described english speakers 
connotations artistic value poetry may lost language independent representations phenomena involve complex networks sign triads discussed 
second component consensual sign triads sign representations physical representations signs 
physical representation visual tactile sensory 
short amount time communicable 
examples linguistic signs traffic signs conceptual graphs symbols 
linguistic signs words phrases sentences longer texts 
meaning sign representation depends consensual context 
example traffic sign dump meaning case sign different meaning sign street corner 
similarly sign representations extinct languages original meaning lost meaning different meaning modern context 
mentioned section contexts easily defined 
consensual context contains information community establishes consensual sign conditions appropriate sign community

easiest case assumptions fulfilled 
assumption sign triad consists set conceptual entities set signs exactly context 
case context represented fca context conceptual entities fca concepts 
second assumption sign representations disambiguated means representation refers exactly conceptual entity 
case sign representations mapped concept lattice 
sign representations mapped concept called synonyms 
second assumption reasonable respect clearly delimited 
example word window general refer kinds windows parts windows 
micro context presumed sentence part sentence word disambiguated 
example looked window window refers glass specific window painted window refers frame specific window 
plural words refer sets instances usually considered extensions single conceptual entity 
normal conversation involve numerous sequential occurrent micro contexts sentence 
example looked window painted word window shifts glass meaning frame meaning 
considered shift micro contexts 
contexts represented fca contexts shifting contexts modeled infomorphisms 
special cases context part instance context equally modeled infomorphisms fulfill additional conditions 
assumptions hold relationship individual consensual sign triad modeled infomorphisms contexts 
case infomorphism maps types consensual context attributes conceptual entities types actual context attributes external entities 
meta conditions contexts conditions time space culture modeled separate concept lattice actual context instance subconcept consensual context 
actual context instantiates consensual context external entities instantiate conceptual entities 
sign representations mapped internal representations

assumptions cases modeled contexts jointly contribute shared set conceptual entities 
triadic fca provides mechanisms formalize general cases conceptual entities fca objects sign representations fca attributes contexts fca conditions 
simpler case global context assumed specific language time cultural group 
assumption triads single sign representations sets contexts conceptual entities studied 
set contexts triad list contexts specific sign representation 
way connotation sign represented representation context example offensive words implies certain contexts representation conceptual entities ones denotes polysemy homography 
application commerce ontologies commerce applications software agents supposed fulfill duties traditional sales people 
human agents easily resolve ambiguities arise sales offers order requests business negotiations agents slightly differing terminology 
ambiguity resolution achieved contextual clues asking negotiating partner clarification 
contrast human agents software agents need explicit representations contextual information example provided ai ontologies 
example illustrates problems 
consortium consisting members edinburgh university industrial partners developed high level ontology commercial applications called enterprise ontology 
provides terms definitions relations 
example customer defined union actual customer potential customer actual customer role legal entity agreeing exchange sale price product sale 
companies enterprise ontology high level modeling framework 
practical applications high level ontology combined ontologies detailed respect specific business transactions 
example xml standard cxml developed 
shows cxml representation fictitious transaction 
straightforward merge cxml enterprise ontology 
shows potential mappings terms 
easiest problem solved renaming terms supplier vendor 
significant problem conceptual entities contexts directly mapped 
explicit information ontology implicit 
example cxml explicitly specify customer 
information customer implicitly contained shipto address fields order request 
second conceptual entities subdivided differently ontology 
example cxml differentiates shipto aspect customer probably different large organization separate department responsible billing 
enterprise ontology consider shipto aspects 
third structure organization ontologies different 
top level structure cxml distinction catalog contains information supplier products index order primary activity ontology 
reason cxml created line transactions 
top level structure enterprise ontology hand general activity organization marketing 
obvious contains elements marketing 
noticeable underlying conceptual structures entirely different ontologies 
possible separate general conceptual entities involved sales transactions contextual aspects viewpoint ontology imposes merging straightforward 
surprising ontologies model processes 
terminology conceptual entities tokens identical difference lies sign representations types contexts type hierarchies 
possible construct channel ontologies 
precise formulation channel left research essential step separating conceptual entities sign representations context described example rest section

merging cxml enterprise ontology enterprise ontology considers different types sales actual sale potential sale sale sale offer 
order request sale example credit card validated 
sale sale offer modeled vendor viewpoint means vendor willing agree sale customer unknown potential customer 
choice left potential sale conceptual entity general potential sale potential contrast order request customer certain 
words direct equivalent cxml order request enterprise ontology 
sign representations terms defined ontology conceptual entities formal definitions terms relations entities features constraints information contexts separated follows 
sale enterprise ontology involves fixed set potential conceptual entities customer vendor price product compare 
potential actual depends specific context 
context refer global context english language global time culture specific contexts sale potential currently negotiated successfully performed 
information separately stored lattice contexts represented

lattice shows viewpoint differences ontologies 
enterprise ontology modeled vendor viewpoint cxml modeled customer viewpoint 
lattice demonstrates cxml order request related sale contexts described enterprise ontology 
example demonstrates sign representations need kept separately change depending context misleading 
example contexts order search order request sale customer called actual customer enterprise ontology
