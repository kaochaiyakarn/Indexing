protocol role symmetric parties execute operations 
easy see protocol requires party perform elliptic curve point multiplications evaluations weil pairing 
compare protocol role symmetric 
protocol requires party perform full elliptic curve point multiplications plus half 
evaluating weil pairing costly operation half point multiplication conclude efficient protocol 
requires deployed pki authenticate long term public keys whilst system uses identity system

id key agreement note protocol message flows ak protocol consist elliptic curve point 
bandwidth required protocols 
note efficiency arguments assume similar sized elliptic curve instances 
probably means protocol supersingular elliptic curve field characteristic
