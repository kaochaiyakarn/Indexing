cost function arises naturally context correcting inefficiency scheme multicast routing 
simplest way broadcasting message receivers unicasting message individually sent receiver 
results copies message traversing network links 
waste bandwidth avoided different form routing called multicast routing

vertices act sources downstream receivers 
manner source reach receivers sending multiple copies message link 
traditionally tree containing source possible receivers fixed 
network restricted tree 
message needs broadcast subset receivers multicast routing picks subtree tree 
ignores high connectivity offered today internet 
desirable receiver set varies message subtree certain subset receivers may arbitrarily costly cheapest tree
