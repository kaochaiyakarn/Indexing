overlap type modeling 
distinctive characteristics naturalistic conversation contrast situations presence overlapping speech 
overlapping speech may types affects flow discourse various ways 
overlap may help floor speaker interruptions encourage speaker continue back channels 
overlaps may accidental part joint action group tries help speaker recall person name mid sentence 
addition different speakers may differ amount kinds overlap engage speaker style 
explore types overlaps physical parameters including prosodic aspects 
language modeling 
meetings especially challenging language model tend comprise diverse range topics styles matched training data hard come initial phase project 
expect meeting recognition necessitate investigation novel language model adaptation robustness techniques 
prosodic modeling 
plan study potential contribution prosodic temporal intonational features automatic processing meeting data 
project just underway constructing database prosodic features meeting data extending earlier 
goals include prosody combined language model information help segment speech coherent semantic units classify dialog acts aid speaker segmentation
