continued existence large technical analysis departments international finance houses consistent hypothesis technical analysis proven empirically useful 
potential application evolutionary automatic programming noted iba iba number reasons suppose evolutionary automatic programming eap approach prove fruitful financial prediction domain 
eap conduct efficient exploration search space uncover dependencies input variables leading selection subset inclusion final model 
additionally eap facilitates utilisation complex fitness functions including discontinuous non differentiable functions 
particular importance financial domain fitness criterion may complex usually requiring balancing return risk 
eap example basic neural net approaches financial prediction require ex ante determination optimal model inputs related transformations 
useful feature eap produces human readable rules potential enhance understanding problem domain

attempting uncover useful technical trading rules index raw current historical price information information initially pre processed technical indicators

initial study ftse dataset neill included moving average indicator 
study includes momentum trading range volatility indicators 
moving average indicators simplest moving average systems compare current share price index value moving average share price index value lagged period determine far current price moved underlying price trend 
smooth daily price fluctuations moving averages visibility underlying trend 
variation simple moving average systems moving average convergence divergence oscillator 
calculated difference short run long run moving average 
recursive fashion complex combinations moving averages values calculated oscillator generate trading rules 
example day moving average oscillator plotted raw value indicator 
trading signal may generated plotted moving averages cross 
moving average indicators trend devices best markets 
slow response changes trends markets missing move 
tend unstable sideways moving markets generating repeated buy sell signals leading unprofitable trading 
trading systems moving averages trade volatility risk loss due sensitivity 
objective select lag period sensitive generate useful early trading signal insensitive random noise 
momentum momentum security ratio time lagged price current price price price 
belief underlying indicator strongly shares tend continue move direction period time investors buy sell share 
evidence momentum trading strategies particularly investing smaller firms hong lim stein 
technical analysts consider price momentum price turning point momentum tend peak price peaks 
trading range breakout systems systems signal usually generated price breaks defined range 
simple example trading rule buy share exceeds previous high weeks conversely sell share falls previous week low 
complex approach plot envelope standard deviations moving average
