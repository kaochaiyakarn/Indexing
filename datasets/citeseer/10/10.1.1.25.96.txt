reasons fingerspelling chosen task digital human model 

hand model modeling asl handshapes poses unique challenges 
applications example grasping hand largely open position 
contrast asl handshapes require fingers close proximity palm 
handshapes hand compact position

taken great care hand appearance movement natural bent position 
human hand complex articulated system consisting bones 
user referred lands accurate descriptions 
hand simplifies anatomy see details 
scripting facility available commercial animation package built set slider controls enable user readily generate handshapes 
movement finger controlled fundamental motions identified asl linguists brent 

fingerspelling aim produce animations asl appear natural quickly reliably recognized members deaf community 
hand controls easily generate handshapes 
create fingerspelling animations handshapes set key frames interpolating rotations joints 
hand complex inverse kinematics control yielded unpredictable unnatural movement 
na interpolation spelling word mad unfortunately pairs letters straightforward interpolation leads collisions fingers 
particularly troublesome letters handshape tight entangled position 
example letters hand closed fist thumb underneath fingers 
see 
na interpolation letters passes thumb fingers 
see 
handshape index middle fingers crossed interpolating letter 
see 
collisions catastrophic involving collisions fingertips pairs cause collisions 
possible conventional collision avoidance algorithm protect fingers 
produce minimal solutions necessarily natural ones 
hand complicated controlling motion resulting constraints accounted general algorithm 
asl entirely dependent relatively small set handshapes chosen data driven solution 
colliding pair handshapes designed interpolation handshapes mimic natural intermediate positions human hand fingerspelling 
data driven approach capitalizes restricted set possible collisions 
represent letters alphabet need handshapes 
letters repeat handshape change palm orientation add simple movement moving transitions handshapes symmetric fortunate situation pairs consider 
interpolation intermediate handshape 
initial cost data entry avoid computational overhead associated general solution 
obtain realistic movement fingers 
example human hand transitions tight handshapes inactive fingers naturally open slightly minimal solution leaves fixed

user testing goal produce animations readily understood members deaf population 
evaluate effectiveness conducted user tests fingerspelling animations preliminary test deaf students local area high school thorough test attendees national exhibition deaf community david 
participants varying levels asl fluency 
students novice asl signers typical attendee proficient asl expert signers 
participant asked identify images alphabetic handshapes sequence fingerspelling animations shown varying speeds 
feedback received included exception word coke animations recognized participants attempt 
participants preferred view animations high rate speed letters second 
obtained useful feedback appearance hand formation handshapes 
images letters confused undoubtedly contributed low rate recognition animation word coke fundamental difficulty asl 
conducted studies participants viewed videotapes asl noted handshapes letters confused 
participants universally enthusiastic project

interestingly participants success identifying animations images handshapes leads believe motion important factor comprehension asl 
pleasantly surprised visitors website asl cs depaul edu able understand words stored small pixels animated gifs 

high recognition rate deaf users gives confidence approach effective 
fine tune system address user feedback having alter fundamental design 
addition making improvements begun sentence generator capable generating animations complete asl sentences 
attached hand exaggerated proportion body 
handshapes essential concerned context respect body 
fact manipulating body allows address issue raised user testing letters confused 
suspect due large part straight angle presentation letters similar appearance 
attached hand body rotation wrist allow hand adjust natural angle view handshapes 
hand required manipulation vast majority joints needed create asl sentences working body introduces challenging issues 
contrast small set handshapes asl general signs involve arbitrary configurations movements arms head torso 
accomplish need general method collision avoidance 
second issue concerns facial expressions 
asl facial expressions modify mood 
essential example expressing interrogative imperative sentences 
challenge movements face subtle rotating limbs need easily understood deaf audience
