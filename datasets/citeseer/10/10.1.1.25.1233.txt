show authentication public key certificates needs include binding key certification owner trust relationships users 
develop simple algebra elements describe compute measures authenticity 
distribution public keys open networks conceivable single global authority trusted key generation distribution different administrative domains typically conflicting economical political interests 
situation agent decide agents wants trust key distribution determine legitimacy received certificates authenticity keys 
propose simple algebra trust determine authenticity received keys 
algebra builds authenticity metric described 
previously proposed metrics algebras authentication discussed 
technically seen humans sign cryptographic certificates keys 
usually assumed human agents cryptographic keys tool certificates practically speaking humans sign certificates 
assumption correct essential explicitly express trust binding key certification owner failing authentication scheme relation appears proceedings ndss network distributed systems security symposium internet society san diego 
ship humans turn scheme authentication keys 
key owner binding objectively assessed necessarily subjective measure meaning individuals different opinions particular binding 
established binding key owner accepting certificates produced example key owner deliberately certifies flawed keys 
essential element algebra consider trustworthiness certifying agents purpose recommending keys certification 
binding recommendation trustworthiness subjective measure meaning agent trusted trusted 
argued trust simply human belief involving subject trusting party object trusted party 
trust key owner binding example expressed believing key authentic trust certifier believe certify keys considers authentic 
added security system objectively universally assessed 
done individuals may qualified purpose rest simply believe 
sense trust system subjective measure system security trust key subjective measure authenticity 
claim measure security authenticity subjective trust 
trust model trust model general model expressing beliefs precisely expressing relatively uncertain beliefs truth statements 
statements crisp assumed true false 
way modelling uncertainty exact opposite fuzzy set theory fuzzy statement example tall person defines fuzzy set tall persons crisp measure example height person mea foot cm combined membership function determines person degree membership fuzzy set 
trust fuzzy concept see fuzzy set theory model trust crisp reliable measure associated trust 
model focus crisp statements describe particular types trust 
statement key authentic assumed true false crisp binary statement 
said statement agent cooperate interaction interpret belief statements trust 
attempt crisp measures assert validity statements 
imperfect knowledge reality fact impossible know certainty statements true false opinion translates degrees belief disbelief uncertainty fills void absence belief disbelief 
express mathematically fb ug designate belief disbelief uncertainty respectively :10.1.1.44.6276
definition opinion fb ug triplet satisfying second third component correspond belief disbelief uncertainty respectively 
called opinion 
eq defines triangle fig opinion uniquely described point fb ug triangle 
example opinion represented point triangle 
disbelief belief uncertainty opinion triangle horizontal bottom line belief disbelief fig represents situations uncertainty equivalent traditional probability model 
uncertainty caused lack evidence support belief disbelief 
order illustrate interpretation uncertainty component example cited 
suppose confront urns containing red black balls ball drawn random 
bet red mean choose draw urn receive prize say draw red ball smaller amount say draw black 
information urn contains red black balls ratio entirely unknown may red balls 
urn ii confirm exactly red black balls 
urn ii people agree probability drawing red ball chances winning loosing bet red ii equal 
urn obvious 
forced bet red people agree chances equal probability drawing red ball case 
example illustrates extreme cases probability totally certain totally uncertain interestingly 
real situations probability estimate absolutely certain single valued probability estimate inadequate expressing observer subjective belief regarding real situation 
opinions degree un certainty easily expressed opinions red red ii ii respectively 
opinions defined def fact dimensional measures consisting probability dimension uncertainty dimension 
hiding uncertainty dimension opinions binary statements projected dimensional probability space produce probability expectation value fb ug opinions strictly ordered ordering opinions probability expectation subsequently ordering probability expectation certainty

ii ii ii certain subjective logic algebra determining trust certification chains framework artificial reasoning called sub modified comparison original expression appearing ndss proceedings logic described 
subjective logic defines various logical operators combining opinions 
opinion interpreted uncertain probability measure subjective logic called calculus uncertain probabilities 
subjective logic contains equivalent traditional logical operators conjunction disjunction negation non traditional operators recommendation consensus 
certification algebra described section operators conjunction recommendation consensus needed 
simplicity operators defined 
symbol denote trust 
subject object duality trust addition superscripts indicate subject subscripts indicate believed statement fb represents agent belief example key authentic meaning believes key authentic degree expressed belief disbelief uncertainty components respectively 
opinions input output parameter operators defined 
definition conjunction fb fb agent opinions distinct binary statements conjunction representing opinion true defined fb conjunction opinions commutative associative requires independent arguments conjunction opinion meaningless 
applied opinions zero uncertainty serial multiplication probabilities 
applied opinions absolute belief disbelief produces truth table logical binary 
definition recommendation agents fb opinion recommendations binary statement fb opinion expressed recommendation opinion result recommendation defined ab fb ab ab ab ab ab ab recommendation interpreted recommends necessarily real opinion 
obvious totally different example defects 
recommendation operator justified assumed recommendation transitive precisely agents recommendation chain change behaviour recommend function entities interact 
pointed assumed defection motivated example certain agents 
definition consensus fb fb opinions respectively held agents binary statement consensus opinion held imaginary agent representing defined fb consensus commutative associative requires independent opinion arguments consensus opinion meaningless 
effect consensus operator reduce uncertainty 
opinions containing zero uncertainty combined practice consensus normally mixed recommendation operator agent receiving absolutely certain conflicting recommendations introduce uncertainty opinions recommenders account making consensus 
agents hold conflicting opinions able reach common consensus opinions contain uncertainty 
problem dependence possible recommendation chains produce opinions statement 
condition opinion independence opinions combined consensus rule produce single opinion target statement 
example mixed consensus recommendation illustrated fig

left sides represent graph fig correctly 
explained differently ways analysing graph method trust paths recommendation course goes opposite direction analysed separately combined consensus 
method corresponds right sides 
second method sub graph containing nodes reduced single node mixing recommendation consensus

trust legend network trust completely analysed authentication certification open networks certification algebra public keys exchanged manually electronically 
manual distribution agent example meet agent physically give diskette containing public key ka give public key ka return 
keys considered authenticated persons mutual physical recognition establishing secure communication certification keys 
electronic key distribution keys need recommended certified recipient trusts recommending certifying keys authenticated public key recipient possesses 
example possesses public key ka possesses public key ka send public key certified private key reception verify certificate correct know received public key authentic establish secure communication

course considerations cryptographic algorithm broken assumed conditions met 
introduce conjunctive recommendation term rt ka ka give short notation rt ka ka environment electronic message exchange agent trusted degree rt ka trusted 
conjunctive recommendation term represents normal interpersonal environment recommendation trustworthiness
