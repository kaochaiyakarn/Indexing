exponential increase amount data available 
number pages available web added day 
enormous amount data addition interactive content rich nature web web popular 
pages vary great extent information content quality 
organization pages allow easy search 
difficult person find document wants related particular information searching 
efficient accurate method classifying huge amount data essential web exploited full potential 
felt long time approaches taken solve problem 
earlier domain experts classification manually 
soon classification done semi automatically automatically 
approaches text categorization statistical machine learning algorithms nearest neighbor approach probabilistic models inductive rule learning support vector mechanics neural networks decision trees 
learning methods exploit hierarchical structure effort classify web content hierarchical structure classification 
text content web page images video multimedia content structure document provide lot information aiding classification page 
existing classification algorithms rely solely text content classification exploiting features 
human mind categorizes pages broad categories sight knowing exact content page 
uses features structure page images links contained page placement come innovative idea automatic web page classification approach 
organized follows

web page classification algorithms attempts categorize web pages varying degree success 
major classifications classified broad categories 
manual classification domain specific experts 

clustering approaches 

meta tags server purpose document indexing 

combination document content meta tags 

solely document content 

link content analysis 
manual classification traditional manual approach classification involve analysis contents web page number domain experts classification textual content yahoo 
sheer volume data web rules approach 
classification subjective open question 
resulted efforts automate entire classification process 
number positive negative training sets number domain experts required 
clustering approaches clustering algorithms widely clusters formed directly background information 
clustering algorithms means require number clusters specified advance 
meta tags classification techniques solely rely content attributes meta name keywords meta name description tags 
relying tags give accurate results large extent possibility web page author include keywords don reflect content page just increase hit rate page search engine results 
search engines relied method failed appropriately classify web documents 
fourth fifth approaches text content web page classification 
text approaches database keywords category prepared follows 
frequency occurrence words phrases category computed existing corpus large amount text 
commonly occurring words called words removed list 
remaining words keywords particular category classification 
classify document words removed remaining keywords phrases represented form feature vector 
document classified appropriate category nearest neighbor classification algorithm 
approaches rely number high quality training documents accurate classification 
mentioned earlier contents web pages vary greatly quality quantity 
observed web pages contain distinct words 
average word frequency documents means words web document rarely appear times 
text algorithms relevant features structure document images classification 
traditional method keyword frequency analysis web documents 
link approach automatic web page categorization technique fact web page refers document contain hints content induce read 
hints classify document referred done observe methods far great extent textual information contained page 
approach structure page image multimedia content page 

structure approach structure approach relies fact features apart text content form gamut information web document 
structure approach tends exploit fact 
web pages belonging particular category similarity structure 
similarities web page categorized broad categories 
information pages 

research pages 

personal home pages 
typical information page logo top followed navigation bar linking page important pages 
observed ratio link text amount text links normal text tends relatively high kinds pages 
contrast personal home pages tend common layout 
name address person appear prominently top page 
included photograph person concerned generally 
bottom page person provides links publications useful links favorite destinations web 
presence photograph person detected subjecting images page face detection algorithms 
augmented layout page placement links helps classification page category 
research pages generally contain huge amounts text equations graphs form images presence equations graphs detected processing histogram images 
algorithms detect presence graphs equations image 
number distinctive gray levels color shades images provides cue page type 
example synthetic images contain colors compared natural image contains large number colors 
general structural information page deduced placement links text images including equations graphs 
information easily extracted html document 
far classification concerned see features link text normal text ratio categories documents varying degrees features particular kinds documents 
classification apriori approach assume certain feature contributes classification page particular category say feature contributes classification page category 
apriori values modified semi automatic learning set sample pages 
final values categorize web pages 

specific implementation implemented system uses structure classification approach classify web pages broad categories 
tested program sample space nearly pages belonging various universities pages web gathered different domains 
implementation takes start page domain input spiders web retrieving pages images 
retrieval breadth care taken avoid cyclic search 
pages images stored local machine local processing feature extraction 
categorization carried phases 
phase feature extraction phase second classification phase 
explained detail sub sections 
feature extraction feature extraction phase important phase system classification features extracted phase 
features provide valuable information document time computationally inexpensive 
set features try capture structure page analyzing placement text links images deduce contents page analyzing images page 
small images approximately considered feature extraction usually correspond buttons icons amount text page gives indication type page 
generally information personal home pages sparse text compared research pages 
counted number characters document information grade text sparse moderate high information content time account commonly words 
taken consideration classification pages 
textual information number placement links page provides valuable information broad category page belongs 
computed ratio number characters links total number characters page 
high ratio means probability page information page high 
information pages contain links fo brief description document referred link 
cases ratio turns low page generally tends information page 
placement links tends important parameter 
image information images page give indication page content 
generally information pages colorful research home pages number distinct colors case information pages 
extracted features give indication 
histogram images distinguish 
number distinct colours images computed 
need account colour shades true colour image considered higher order bits colour shade give total colours 
mentioned earlier information pages colours personal home pages turn colours research pages 
research pages usually contain binary images information extracted 
histogram synthetic images generally tends concentrate bands colour shades 
contrast histogram natural images spread larger area 
fact differentiate natural synthetic images 
information pages usually contain natural images research pages contain number synthetic images representing graphs mathematical equations mathematical equations generally research pages 
standard implementation detect presence mathematical equations graphs image 
information approach suggested includes classification video multimedia content current implementation take kind information consideration

example case home page weight assigned feature presence image human face weight research page 
presence photograph increases chance classified personal home page time decreases chance classified research page information page 
initially assigned different weights features different categories 
assumptions heuristics modified reflect values implementation runs sample pages 
example presence mathematical equations information page assigned negative weight category 
similarly high ratio links assigned negative weight research page
