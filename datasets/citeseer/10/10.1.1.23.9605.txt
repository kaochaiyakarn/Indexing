locality compatibility giunchiglia context defined subset complete state individual reasoning goal 
intuition reasoning local involves small subset agent knows subset determines context reasoning 
intuition mapped idea context partial approximate theory world encodes agent perspective 
partial theory represent information agent world small portion 
approximate theory portion represented level detail 
examples context facts agent knows specific domain money agent beliefs italian cuisine 
facts agent uses solve problem particular occasion facts agent uses interpret agent utterance 
context money example partial money italian cuisine approximate example guha relationship ob ject cost represented different levels detail binary predicate costs costs naive money theory ternary predicate costs general transaction theory may different kinds costs associated object 
view logic context logic possible relations partial approximate theories 
idea ffl side take seriously idea context theory partial approximate expressiveness said denotation truth logical consequence conceived local context 
call principle locality ffl side fact agent complete knowledge represented collection contexts suggests different kinds relations exist different contexts 
call principle compatibility 
consequence locality different contexts may different ontologies intuitively represents different portion agent knowledge 
instance ontology context describing john beliefs world calvin hobbs include children tigers cars schools friendship ontology context describing john beliefs mechanics include different categories objects 
second consequence contexts require local notion denotation truth

local models semantics giunchiglia ghidini provides intuitive semantics mc systems called local models semantics lms

core intuitions mainly show locality compatibility captured lms 
sake simplicity discuss case contexts 
generalization enumerable set contexts straightforward 
consider 
order languages think languages associated contexts 
circles labelled bottom class order models languages taken isolation 
called local model basic idea lms may exist constraints local models language language embedded mc system 
constraints called compatibility relations semantical counterpart bridge rules 
syntactically bridge rule allows derive contexts formulae derive local inference rules 
semantically means set admissible local models smaller bridge rule 
semantical effect bridge rule cut away local models language 
context semantical point view thought set local models satisfy set local axioms omega definition set constraints depend relations local models languages 
grey areas circles labelled respectively represents contexts result restricting sets models languages taken isolation set models survived constraints 
formally sets local models pair hm called compatibility pair 
compatibility relation set compatibility pairs theta model mc system non empty compatibility relation pair belong relation technical reasons need discuss

proof theoretically locality captured application rules delta associated context compatibility captured application bridge rules 
locality captured fact notion satisfiability local satisfiability labelled formula terms local satisfiability formula respect context structures consider test local satisfiability local contexts generally different domains interpretation sets relations sets functions compatibility captured idea forcing relations set local models defining context sense force local models agree certain extent

intuition complete list implicit assumptions context general context new assumption taken account 
problem approaches respect principle locality dinsmore reduces truth assertion space truth complex assertion space space base mccarthy logic context form formalized buvac mason introduces modal formulae truth value context depends truth value formula different context clear notion local satisfiability 
worth noting mc systems allow simulate hierarchical structure mccarthy logic 
define mc system bridge rules reflection rules form ist intuitive meaning index formula ist derivable iff formula derivable main difference hierarchy embedded contexts hardwired mccarthy logic framework just possible architecture represents special case compatibility involving infinite chain contexts context sort metatheory context far know mc systems formal framework explicitly allows multiple distinct languages 
dinsmore guha mccarthy buvac introduce examples require feature 
turn examples formal systems things different 
dinsmore logic pr buvac logic context explicitly start single language set formed formulae space context 
guha logic exception distinction grammaticality meaningfulness results definition language starting single vocabulary quite cumbersome 
localization expressiveness conceptual advantage having multiple languages problem defining different meanings symbol different contexts single language approach just specify relations interpretation symbols belonging language different contexts 
words fact formulae belonging languages different contexts happen syntactic form mean principle meaning related way 
relation exists state explicitly adding suitable bridge rule axiom system 
mc systems context framework allows different logics different contexts

john reasons assume mary modus ponens rule included inference rules context mary context john simulates mary reasoning process 
opinion essential feature framework mental representation 
compatibility allows model examples lifting proposed guha mccarthy group examples partitioned reasoning proposed dinsmore 
stress fact compatibility conceptually different lifting defined guha mccarthy 
mc systems notion saying thing different contexts 
interesting notice notion intuitions guha mccarthy describe complete knowledge context
