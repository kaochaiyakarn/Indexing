adopting plan approach key advantages 
maintaining explicit representation agent plans easily reason possible outcomes essential modeling emotions hope fear involve expectations 
explicit representations allow recognize plans actions agent facilitate hinder goals essential modeling emotions anger reproach typically involve multiple actors

building elliott theory mile characterizes emotional impact external events set knowledge structures called frames 
frames created certain syntactic features recognized agent internal state 
example agent adopts new goal informed goal agent frames created track status goal 
frame describes situation terms number specific features virtual village cluding point view appraisal formed desirability situation situation come pass possibility situation merits praise blame 
features derived domainindependent rules examine state plan memory advance prior approaches utilize large numbers domain specific rules form assessment

emotion behavior people exhibit wide repertoire nonverbal behaviors consistent emotional state facial expressions gestures body posture behaviors intentionally communicative suggest considerable information person emotional arousal attitudes attending 
observers reliably infer person emotions attitudes nonverbal behaviors ekman potentially respond variety ways 
creating virtual humans maintain convey internal emotional state ensure agent performance suggests corresponding emotional state observer run risk creating confusion disbelief

model address particular concerns 
particular concern agent characters design provide convincing humans facing difficult dangerous problems 
emotionally revealing nonverbal behaviors expressions consistent deeply evocative disturbing situations 
behaviors change concert emotional state characters obviously people express differently sad happy angry 
behaviors unique individual exhibits behaviors way 
key concern agent mix nonverbal behavior time appear emotionally consistent 
consider severe depression 
ways convey severe depression may effective agent appear withdrawn 
supposedly depressed agent various open communicative gestures beats mcneill expressing agent performance may read correctly 
behavior may appear consistent depression 
especially agent previously exhibiting behaviors consistent depression 
fact mix gestures agent coherent avoid unintended interpretations 
example people don tend deictic gesture simultaneously gaze due mild feelings anger guilt 
behavior may look unnatural inconsistent may convey different shade meaning depending context 
say mix behaviors monolithic 
people say thing expressing 
mix nonverbal behaviors shade meaning said communicated

discussion project early stages initial prototype completed september 
research perspective biggest limitation lack evaluation 
mre viable learning environment 
addition emotional models increase realism scenario 
people find character reactions plausible 
emotional models impact learning experience 
plan formal evaluations coming year conjunction research groups psychology communications departments university southern california 
anecdotal feedback encouraging 
demonstrated system number military personal served bosnia strongly affected experience 
army colonel began relating related incident seeing demo quite emotional concluded saying system people feel need playing role lieutenant mother character began wouldn respond anger exceeds threshold 
encouraging number problems addressed exercise mre system potential learning environment evaluate effectiveness 
prototype interactive 
system uses speech recognition recognition grammar quite limited 
furthermore variability order events occur scenario essentially linear narrative branch point lieutenant sends reinforce platoon 
scenario exercise flexibility emotional models provides little evidence emotional responses appear appropriate wider range interactions 
performing rigorous evaluation need allow student exercise flexibility adding domain knowledge cover possible decisions 
steve reasoning capabilities augmented steve designed teach single correct procedure repair engine range possible alternatives 
lack alternatives difficult model impact emotional state decision making naturally encoded preference alternative courses action 
limitation current reliance motion capture data motions gestures animated characters 
motion capture generates fluid realistic motion suited real time interactions 
solution hub spoke model short motion capture segments allowed express dynamics mother emotional state substitute procedural control 
solution propose integrate badler emote system chi 
emote procedurally morph motion capture date number dimensions making gesture energy gestures directed inward outward advocated physical focus model 
number limitations system infers emotional state need adjustment re thinking light application 
key issue notion responsibility 
example mother blame accident 
troops 

sense shared sense responsibility sense change dynamically influenced emotional state subsequent actions troops 
currently simply steve responsibility constraints assign blame 
treatment anger simplistic 
anger influenced extent decide intended offending action extent show attempt 
suspect explicit plans assist forming assessments sorting 
limitations integration plan appraisal emotional state model physical focus provides great deal architectural support emotional modeling
