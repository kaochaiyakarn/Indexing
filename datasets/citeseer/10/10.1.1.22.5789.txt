chronicle recognition problem problem want solve recognize complex scenarios called chronicles set temporally constrained events 
problem divided subproblems 
problem find representation model chronicles consisting temporally related events situated context 
second problem develop inference mechanism takes stream timestamped events recognize chronicle scenario instance completed 
currently ixtet chronicle recognition system developed laas toulouse france ghallab modeling recognition 
ixtet temporal constraint networks represent time linearly ordered set discrete events 
capable representing constraints equal disjunctions numerical constraints time points form intervals corresponding lower upper bounds temporal distance time points disjunctions problem come np complete :10.1.1.40.1018
chronicle recognized generate events fed back system allow chains events triggered 
ixtet chronicle recognition system recognize scenarios happened keeps track possible developments ghallab calls prediction 
reasons want study chronicle recognition guide planning execution plans witas uav 
purpose guidance improve quality plans efficiency plan execution 
reason reduce amount data sent operator uav sending endless stream data car position hx zi moving direction operator tell uav monitor driving vehicles passing certain location building activities certain vehicle 
applications chronicle recognition surveillance dynamic systems example success monitor gas telecommunication networks 
similar approaches ixtet proposed 
example fontaine tries match temporal constraint networks satisfying constructing graph chronicle recognized observed events called session trying match 
approach close text pattern recognition techniques finite state automaton transitions correspond observed events levy 
approach efficient recognizing sequential chronicles structures impair performance 
related research area plan recognition infer plan agent executing observing agents interactions world maintaining model mental states agents general concept chronicle scenario 
pynadath wellman difference general pattern recognition count chronicle recognition plan recognition plans rational agent mental state improve matching 
chronicle recognition take actual events account agent causing events

chronicle recognition architecture chronicle recognition system needs types inputs job 
needs know recognize chronicles match primitive events arrive 
second needs time stamped observations primitive events actual recognition 
shows setup current witas architecture 
subsystems shown picture reactive procedural system responsible controlling uav active vision system 
responsible turning chronicles recognized 
vision system responsible input cameras extract primitive information cars seen properties position direction velocity 
information accurate problem anchoring image data received vision system actual vehicle objects knowledge base 
dor dynamic object repository responsible storing dynamic data uav 
contains information extracted vision system information uav position velocity heading 
gis geographical information system responsible keeping track static geographic data needed uav making geographic calculations calculating line sight possible paths road network 
front responsible gathering currently interesting pieces data dor gis combine primitive events chronicle recognition system uses 
examples primitive events car road road car moving move car car 
chronicle recognition engine responsible recognizing chronicles tells recognize 
primitive events generated front recognized chronicles inputs 
recognized chronicles reported 
dor front gis chronicle recognition engine vision request geographic updates information primitive events recognized primitive events dynamic information recognized chronicles chronicles request 
data flow witas chronicle recognition system 
prototype chronicle recognition engine subsystem implemented working 
original ixtet implementation new implementation christophe france telecom called crs 
main reason designed embedded applications ixtet 
currently working integrating rest witas architecture depicted 
chronicle recognition system fully integrated witas architecture intend extensive tests see problems exists needs done order system useful able refine chronicles see situations recognize 
known problems current system explicit support vagueness event descriptions reason explicitly certainty events depend completeness event detections relevant changes events detected completeness chronicle recognition 
problems solved writing specialized chronicles explicitly takes missing observations account easy forget special cases real time properties chronicle recogni tion system dependent number chronicles recognized reduce usefulness 
top priority extend modeling reasoning capabilities take uncertainty account 
different types uncertainty needs accounted example false noisy missing observations noisy incomplete domain models 
longer perspective possible directions extend temporal done temporal constraint networks 
learning construct chronicles statistical data domain modeled 
extend representation general plan recognition 
include constructs handling agents observed mental state 
probably needed want model scenarios car heading car trying escape scenarios involves intention drivers vehicles 

summary discussed chronicle recognition problem way modeling recognizing situations scenarios called chronicles temporally related events 
described chronicle recognition system called ixtet implementation called crs witas uav project detect chronicles vehicles overtaking passing vehicles 
discussed known problems current system possible directions research 
experience current prototype positive results expected system developed tested 
aim project able handle uncertainty incomplete observations retaining efficiency current system
