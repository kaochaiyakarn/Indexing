mediated faces judith donath mit media lab 
incorporating faces mediated discussions complex design problem 
face conveys social personal identity reports changes emotion cumulative effects repeated expressions 
face expresses shows person wishes convey 
highly attuned recognizing interpreting faces interpretations subjective 
incorporating faces mediated environments quite desirable helps participants gain stronger sense community potentially provide finely nuanced expression 
significant disadvantages difficulties 
immediate identifying markers revealed face race gender age necessarily initial information wants ideal society 
lost path user thought input device output rendering 
essay discusses key social cognitive technical issues involved incorporating faces mediated communication 
face essential real world social interactions read character expression face recognize people face face indicates attention lies 
face absent online interactions part people find cyberspace pale substitute real world contact 
today fast graphics cards high bandwidth connections eliminated technical barriers making virtual world fully real world 
problem goes geometric models facial structure complex social cognitive aspects face communication directly mediated environment 
furthermore desirability faces assumed interfaces online communities absence faces immediate revelation race gender age identity 
bringing face interface requires radically reinventing notion personal appearance remaining grounded cognitive cultural meanings familiar face 
requires analyzing applications understand aspect face need convey personal identity 
level 
emotional expression 
finding intuitive ways input express information 
cases best interface realistic possible face may best served synthetically rendered image selectively conveys social information 
faces ways computer interfaces representing people machines 
focuses role face computer mediated human interactions face represents particular individual communicating people real time online discussion 
research computer mediated communication assume ultimate goal recreate reality faithfully possible 
computer possible go create environments features abilities possible ordinary everyday world 
create environments face shows expression reveal user identity create worlds traces user history actions sketched lines face 
introducing faces mediated communication system done carefully face replete social cues subtle signals poorly designed facial interface sends unintended inaccurate messages doing harm 
faces mediated human human communication 
reasons uses faces mediated communication 
face cognitively rich holds great 
newborn babies hours old gaze longer face image random array 
environment filled faces endlessly interesting observe 
people watching favorite scan surrounding scene familiar faces imagine identity individual stranger 
online environment populated people faces may sociable friendly intriguing textual purely space 
faces convey important social information thinking 
cognitively wired recognize remember faces individual identity uniquely represented face 
face conveys social identity features indicate basic categories age gender associated particular personality types 
face conveys emotional state intent displaying wide range expressions terror delight 
faces helps moderate conversations 
gaze indicate direct remarks individual hold yield floor 
facial expressions soften words expressing humor regret face important conveying responses show understanding agreement people behave socially greater restraint interacting face 
sproull people responded quite differently questions posed computers text facial displays 
instance asked questions text answered little queried facial display attempted best possible light 
reasons faces mediated communication advantages certain circumstances 
social responses sproull detected friendly discussion forum sociable may detrimental times 
isaacs tang noted non facial interfaces efficient participants attended problems hand time consuming rituals greetings small talk ordinary requires sproull kiesler hierarchical distinctions flattened text discussions plausible untested distinctions regain prominence mediated environment populated visible faces desirability maintaining flattening distinctions context dependent 
face allows characterize people glance 
real world things learns social categories age gender race cues categories embodied face 
ideal world necessarily impression 
online world touted place identified words ideas free stereotypes imposed categorization online spaces face visible afford freedom 
simple metric measuring desirability conveying information numerous factors purpose forum background participants affecting evaluation 
understand fully social cues face convey knowledge help determine facial display appropriate 
including faces interface difficult 
large extent due fact face expressive subtle filled meaning 
ascribe character read emotion face especially realistically rendered 
truly neutral face 
face interface replete social messages poorly designed send unintended ones 
real world social situations constantly adjusting face appropriate thing hide show feelings gaze proper direction 
expect mediated faces elide particular social protocol read unintended message absence required expression accidental invoking inappropriate 
making right expression extremely complex single motion precisely timed choreography multiple movements smile flashes briefly conveys different message smile 
goals better understand fundamental limits mediated faces 
problems mediated faces sending unintended messages ameliorated better input sensors better renderings 
aspects face social role transferred mediated world 
address questions looking closely social information face conveys examining technologies bring features mediated world 
face convey 
aspect face provides sort social cue adept perceiving minute details configuration knowing act expect fundamental social interaction knowledge depends able distinguish men women expressions anger joy children adults friends strangers information read face 
societal structures developed assumption face conveyed information available context interaction 
face conveys information structure dynamics decorations 
structural qualities include head shape size placement eyes features lines texture skin color quantity scalp facial hair 
viewers assess personality classifications race gender age 
dynamic qualities include gaze direction pupil dilation smiling 
viewers read emotional expression attention 
decorations include viewers read cultural cues ranging large scale group membership subtleties class distinctions membership 
considerable interplay qualities convey social cues 
affect assessment age cultural modify production interpretation emotional expressions gender determination structural cues impacts cultural interpretation fabricated elements short hair 
recognition primarily structural times recognize acquaintance grown beard shown photograph expression 
face conveys major types social information individual identity social identity expression gaze 
inclusive list important functions fall outside scope lip reader knows displaying words saying 
types may unbalanced social identity broad sorts information gender genetics gaze really means faces conveys information conversational turn openings attention 
division useful thinking mediated interactions addressing communicative functions independently brings great deal flexibility creative possibilities design interface 
individual identity adept recognizing people 
recognize distance various viewpoints different expressions change age 
find familiar face crowd remarkable speed especially considering complex task mental construct sought face compared visible faces quite similar structure seen different angles range lighting conditions feature different expression 
strong evidence specific neurological bases recognizing faces 
example injury particular area brain section ability distinguish minute differences faces acute chernoff proposed advantage ability multivariate statistical visualization faces graphical representation chernoff faces map data facial features nose length eye tilt head shape 
resulting faces may look happy sad surprised underlying data independent interpreted social meaning face 
central visual system leaves people vision intact nearly unable recognize faces condition known 
notion personal identity recognition people face 
oxford english dictionary anonymous identity today online text worlds norm extent participants identified left anonymous design feature various environments 
anonymous named forums exist produces different tone suited different purpose 
anonymous pseudonymous spaces provide arena exploring alternate safe haven discussing highly sensitive subjects endless exchange flames spam 
named forums bring weight real world reputation online world general people behave real life 
online forums participants real faces featured example videoconference essentially named environments 
discussion desirability video medium focuses issues bandwidth requirements common gaze problem discussed 
fact forum public sphere seen known needs kept mind deep effect space 
social identity character recognize people individuals types 
cues see face quickly categorize people gender ethnicity age judgements character personality 
classifications tell act behaviors expect interpret words actions 
languages difficult construct grammatically culturally correct sentence knowing age gender relative social status 
distinctions basis prejudice significant biases people consciously race gender stereotypes 
subtle pervasive biases character judgements basis facial structure person baby ish facial structure large eyes small nose large forehead small chin judged child nature trusting naive kind weak 
character judgements face derive generalization effects 
strong responses cues important attributes health age anger strong get generalized people faces merely resemble attribute emotion 
cyberspace text version touted ideal realm visual absence cues means people known judged words gender race attractiveness 
simply matter text face classification bad 
cues gather face basic established social interactions people find need put face name go certain level familiarity comfort 
furthermore simply eliminating face eliminate underlying cultural differences 
distinction structural dynamic decorative facial features especially useful thinking mediated faces features serve different social purposes may electively separately implemented 
instance decorative features glasses makeup reflect choices circumstances 
re created decoration online self representations graphical muds games popular call feature avatars appearance derives player taste today wish appear purple role registered may choose yellow green smiley face 
simplistic decorations far subtle social messages communicate personal decorations real world potential certainly exists online decorations increasingly sophisticated mediated world evolves 
dynamic features separable motion capture facial animation programs track dynamic facial movements live actor animate synthetic face 
synthesized face original actor technique achieve low bit rate transmission facial expressions appropriately modelled face 
techniques primarily convey expression independently features important note information social identity may imparted way think people detect cues age gender dynamics face demonstrated point light experiments key points face marked dots rest invisible observers see moving dots 
structural features problematic terms 
genetically determined features bone structure skin color assess personality morality intelligence raises biggest concerns unfair bias facial features 
cyberspace text version touted ideal world prejudice eliminated initial cues stereotypes invisible 
viewpoint interface brings real face cyberspace destroys utopia mundane world bias inducing cues 
practice situation complex 
instance gender differences language men women imperatives quite differently 
hiding gender online requires simply declaring oneself gender adapt entire tone wording subtle 
gender hidden online uncovered writing style albeit slowly identification face face world 
furthermore lack cues social identity lead people thinking ciphers categorization occurs high likelihood error error consequences 
instance mistakenly assume man woman uses locutions ordinary spoken woman coming man passive accommodating see man particular type man timid sensitive 
see removing face interface remove immediate social cate cues eliminate categorization entirely ambiguity ensues introduces new social problems 
expression important controversial communicative aspects face ability convey emotion 
see smiling know happy see know angry 
smile forced deliberate attempt appear happy feeling quite opposite indicates deep concentration anger 
surrounded expressive faces considerable controversy communicate really reveal 
debate surrounds questions face reveals emotions primarily source intentional communication 
debate surrounds questions interpretation emotions revealed face innate cross cultural learned subject cultural variation 
debate exists emotions exist non scientific construct disparate features ranging physiological state intent 
prevalent conceptualization relationship face emotions russell fern ndez call facial expression program roots darwin writings face elucidated izard ekman 
key ideas model number basic universal emotions cited number anger disgust fear happiness sadness surprise face reveals internal emotional state may attempt hide distort expressive view observers face generally able correctly read underlying emotion facial expression 
ekman quite influential computer graphics field conceptualization relationship emotions facial expression underlies research facial animation 
context designing face interfaces mediated communication systems debate emotional expression vs communication intent especially relevant 
ekman emphasizes expressive subconscious side facial expressions major branch research study deception involuntary cues facial expression gesture reveal lying 
perspective advantage face receiver may gain sense intent involuntary cues revealed face gesture tone voice deliberately controlled words 
model rejected claims face communicative functions advantage face owner expression revealed information advantage receiver disadvantage owner evolutionarily untenable 
design problem issue control facial display controlled deliberately user driven measurements user affective state 
display user actual face video question moot face may displaying affective state intentionality system change 
expressions facial display driven decision important 
take extremes deliberate facial expression model implemented face controlled pressing button mood command opens cascading menu select facial expression avatar 
alternatively change mood avatar pressing function keys listed cascading menu mood buttons toolbar opposed face expression driven affective data gathered sensors measuring blood pressure heart rate breathing rate skin response bodily reactions provide cues affective state 
universal vs subjective interpretation facial expression controversial 
smile universally recognized agreed expressions quite differently different cultures 
appropriate smile long culturally dependent 
meaning read expression minute timings motions smile 
context essential understanding facial expression 
fern ndez carroll caution studies facial expression carried context consideration referring just broad cultural contexts ubiquitous immediate context interaction 
point facial expressions carry multiple meanings observer uses contextual information interpret 
important feature keep mind understanding mediated faces mediated discussions occur complex settings participant simultaneously immediate mediated context 
smile perceive may directed may triggered event space am 
mixing contexts occurs real life thoughts surroundings constitute context smiling oh just remembering mediated situation multiple contexts observation expressions triggered intended contexts may common occurrence 
gaze gaze looking important channel social information 
quite adept perceiving gaze direction aided strong contrast eye white cornea colored iris contextual information infer people state mind 
gaze conversation determine turning floor thinking say 
gaze disambiguate language talking re welcome 
gaze input output look interested interest revealed visible direction gaze 
rules govern gaze communication complex culturally dependent 
studies gaze conversation see instance show intricate ballet words gestures eye movements taken negotiate turn establish social control reflect levels intimacy indicate understanding attention 
research gaze focuses role indicator attention 
social communication gaze functions eyes may indication attention 
typical conversation speaker looks listeners monitor level agreement understanding direct utterance particular individuals command attention persuade 
speaker may look away listeners order concentrate complex cognitive task thinking say embarrassment discomfort typically speakers look listeners time 
listeners look speaker time gaze directed speaker may signal agreement attempt gain turn 
listener gaze may indicate close concentration complete lack attention 
furthermore length time socially comfortable people look depends relationship strangers look briefly frequently acquaintances prolonged mutual gaze sign romance intimacy 
numerous attempts bring gaze computer mediated conversations 
problem show person looking deceptively simple remains imperfectly solved 
interfaces avatar graphical chats current multi party videoconferencing systems simply ignore problem leaving avatars gaze random directions videoconference participants appear separate windows appearing look spot just viewer shoulder 
interfaces take simplistic approach gaze broadly indicate attention ignoring myriad social cues gaze provides 
interfaces attempt recreate meaningful gaze mediated environment quickly immense baroque systems hydra relatively simple system requires cameras monitors number participants describes immersive approach uses numerous cameras fast processors bandwidth available high speed research hubs facilitate casual conversation quite real time 
bringing gaze mediated world difficult gaze bridges space people people mediated conversation space 
addressing problems requires developing means participants signal meaningful gaze patterns creating common virtual space gaze 
addressing problem means finding way create common virtual space finding way participants control gaze algorithmically detecting looking 
videoconferencing basic problem common space shared participants 
person system camera function stand conversational partner looks camera appear looking person 
camera appropriately located ideally coincident video image eyes challenges generated opacity video screens mobility people heads 
participants problem far difficult single camera stand person 
avatar systems problem user convey avatar depicted gazing 
act indicating gaze separated process looking challenge motivate user provide attention indicating information 
face highly expressive informative quantitative graph 
conveys somewhat ambiguous subjective open range interpretations strongly colored observer context

design decisions impact technological requirements complexity system significantly changes social dynamics interface 
bringing face interface difficult problem today systems steps achieving ultimate goal steps go 
researchers ultimate goal achieve mediated encounter experience place possible 
video conferencing shares goal especially research computationally sophisticated approaches tele immersion multiple distant participants interact common virtual space 
problems domain today poor image quality lag solved increased bandwidth computational power 
immense challenges particular need create common virtual space interaction simultaneously depicting subtle expressive shifts participants 
goal 
hollan stornetta termed reproducing reality urged designers go develop new forms mediated interaction enable people communicate unprecedented ways aim better reality 
example may wish interface uses expressive face gaze provide sense immediacy presence floor control get real life reveal user identity 
may wish faces change expression response user deliberate commands conversely direct response user affective state analyzed various sensors 
may wish faces function visualization interaction history online hopefully benign version wilde picture gray 
faces start blank ciphers slowly reveal identity cues acquaintances grow closer 
possible interfaces relatively simple implement difficult attempting 
design challenge know universe possible designs useful intriguing intuitive designs 
video quest video technology possible transmit image network displayed distant location 
video advantage letting natural face mediated face 
slight smile raised brows expressive nuances transmitted directly 
video reveals personal social identity appear recognizable self

video reveals identity 
studies indicate face identity cues transmitted video lost process 
rocco observed people need initial face face meeting establish trust needed communicate online text video 
may primarily due poor quality today video channel loses distorts social cues introducing delays rendering gaze axis 
instance limited bandwidth known limited bandwidth reducing audio lag important eliminating motion lag important reproducing spatial detail social cues subtle expressions may lost detail 
timing delays exist give distorted sense responsiveness interest delays may measurably slight perceptually significant potentially creating quite misleading generally terribly impression impression interpreted awkward unfriendly purely artefact technology 
video improve social interactions compared audio conferencing 
isaacs tang research comparing collaboration videoconferencing audio conferencing face face meetings interesting observations social role mediated face 
greatest advantage video making interactions subtle natural easier 
point may group people task quickly sort metric measure usefulness video channel provides important channel social messages 
instance helps convey level understanding agreement people nod heads indicate argument may lift eyebrows show doubt tilt heads indicate skepticism indicate confusion 
video useful managing pauses see person struggling find right phrase interrupted activity 
video said adds improves ability show understanding forecast responses give non verbal information enhance verbal descriptions manage pauses express attitudes 
simply put video interactions markedly richer subtler easier telephone interactions video inherent drawbacks 
isaacs tang enumerated number videoconferencing weaknesses noting difficult impossible participants manage turn control floor body position eye gaze notice motion peripheral vision side conversations point things space manipulate real world objects drawbacks arise participants share common space 
isaac tang problems person 
key problem gaze awareness look image am looking camera image see appears gazing 
addressed clever half mirrors integrated camera gaze match real world expectations 
close may worse awareness camera lost attribute gaze behavior intent technology 
problems exacerbated participants 
people theoretically possible camera transmit approximately correct point view cameras 
number experimental designs address problem 
fall categories multiple cameras displays extend videoconference model hydra combination modelling head tracking gear create video driven synthetic space tele immersion 
approach multiple cameras displays placed space 
participant seen individual monitor setup replicated site 
instance camera monitor setup placed seat conference table camera facing live person room 
video camera associated image node needs sent shows person correct angle looking seat 
implemented correctly method allows multiple participants indicate attention looking share common space extent physical environment replicated site 
approach requires multiple installations cameras monitors 
provides little flexibility leave seat chat quietly person 
reduced case participants indistinguishable video conferencing shares aforementioned advantages disadvantages 
approach attempts create environment seamlessly blends local remote common virtual space 
multiple video cameras capture actions participant location information various sensors considerable amount computational power participant mapped common virtual world

way 
systems early stages development 
commonly avatar programs primitive style expressive input output expression buttons keyboard shortcuts user change avatar face sport smile 
systems simple argue simplicity problem complexity desirable 
key balance information provided message sent 
minimal information provided minimal message sent 
problem face interfaces sending complex message receipt little data 
face highly expressive adept reading reading level detail rendering provoke interpretation various social messages messages unintentional face arguably hindering communication helping 
solution stick simple faces 
ubiquitous typed symbols resemble sideways faces smile extremely simple function quite helping communicate expressive information clarifies sender intention 
mail notorious generating anger due miscommunication irony sympathy clear statement meant writer incident reporting 
essentially new forms spread quickly intuitive needed 
familiar iconic facial expression immediately accessible readers creating avatar somewhat reminiscent human brings play numerous requirements behavior 
instance plain circle user representation see example move circles screen sliding movement perfectly reasonable 
decide human representation create avatar legs sliding screen awkward avatar appears passive inert 
legs want walk may user render step automatic walking algorithm 
hand rendered far expressively communicative puts onerous burden user expend attention getting avatar put foot front little time left communicating 
avatar automated walking algorithms 
simple interface ask user destination take care getting avatar 
behavior walking social information read moods gait characteristics ranging sexual attractiveness providing avatar legs require walk walking inherently expressive 
user indicated endpoint avatar communicated 
cultural differences occur 
japanese differ western ones 
instance japan women supposed show teeth smiling depicted female smile 
second popular icon cold clear western equivalent true face 
representational avatar requires behaviors behaviors expressive introducing big question expressing person wishes express 
interesting example provided cassell 
humanoid avatars chat environment provided automated social actions 
user indicates system social actions perform avatar performs series visible actions communicate intention 
instance indicate desire break away conversation user puts sentence avatar accompanies words diverted gaze 
person responds similarly prefixed sentence conversation ends mutual conversation continues parties produce leave sentences 
developers addressed body problem avatar physical behavior approach issues raises considered primarily realm face 
key issue highlights communicative competence 
social signals send greet take leave simply informative actions displays communicative competence 
compare input output situation 
real world decide conversation am bored am late appointment sense person needs go don want combination 
cases gestures indicate leave may quite different may look distraction may glance watch may look directly person take leave 
conveys different message expresses different level competence 
am leaving sense impatience impression convey quite different look shoes goodbye flee graciously shake hands say pleasant go 
actions leave modified immediate motivations underlying social knowledge style 
participant conversation gather lot information leave behaviors bit intends leave 
get sense leave taker reasons leaving level concern feelings social sophistication system user conveys bit forward slash says intend leave 
systems expands complex performance designed draw social knowledge performance receiver interprets sender intent 
problem performance sender intends 
better unintentional cues 
answer depends context design decision 
cassell state research goals include pushing limits autonomous avatar behavior see far take autonomous behavior user longer feels control 
understanding limits important contribution understanding integrate face mediated communications 
numerous approaches creating mediated faces 
input user writing speech derive expression drive animation 
body chat systems introduce unintentional expressivity translation systems transforming input model user inner state intentionality representing state animation 
neal stephenson suggests novel expressivity come choice autonomous behavior avatar modules express clothing today 
systems video images measurements face animate facial models interesting translation 
rendered face may completely fictional photorealistic systems run gamut anonymous identified expressions deliberate subconscious derived directly user face facial expressions re implicit state 
key problem bringing face mediated environment balance input output 
real world face millions inputs controlling highly nuanced features genes determine basic facial structure nerves muscles control lips eyes eyebrows 
virtual world control structure coarser 
understand communicative ability system create match face
