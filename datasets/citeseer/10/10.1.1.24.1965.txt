problem word levied alternative words imposed believed requested correlated alternatives similar meaning problem word 
problem represent problem word choice choice choice represent alternatives 
pmi ir algorithm assigns score choice score choice selects choice maximizes score 
pmi ir algorithm lsa occurrence 
core idea word characterized keeps 
different measures degree words occur 
pmi ir uses pointwise mutual information pmi follows score choice log problem choice problem choice problem choice probability problem choice occur :10.1.1.14.5547
problem choice statistically independent probability cooccur product problem choice 
independent tendency occur problem choice greater lecture notes computer science problem 
ratio problem problem measure degree statistical dependence problem log ratio amount information acquire presence problem observe equation symmetrical amount information acquire presence choice observe problem explains term mutual information 
looking maximum score drop log monotonically increasing problem value choices problem word 
simplifies score problem words choice simply scored conditional probability problem word choice word problem choice 
pmi ir uses information retrieval ir calculate probabilities 
evaluate different versions pmi ir different kinds queries 
description different methods calculating uses altavista advanced search query syntax 
hits query number hits number documents retrieved query query altavista 
scores order increasing sophistication 
seen increasingly refined interpretations means words occur increasingly refined interpretations equation 
score simplest case say words occur appear document score choice hits problem choice hits choice ask altavista documents contain problem choice ask documents contain choice 
ratio numbers score choice score asking documents contain problem choice ask documents contain words close score choice hits problem near choice hits choice altavista near operator constrains search documents contain problem choice words order 
score scores tend score antonyms highly synonyms 
example big small may get score big large 
score tends reduce effect resulting lower scores antonyms explanation term pointwise mutual information see 
score choice lecture notes computer science hits problem near choice problem choice near hits choice choice near score fourth score takes context account 
context toefl questions esl questions involve context 
example year early spring farmers tap maple syrup trees drain boil knock rap problem word tap context best match choice words knock rap context maple syrup drain better match tap 
general addition problem word problem alternatives choice choice choice may context words context context context 
score includes context word score choice hits problem near choice context problem choice near hits choice context choice near equation easily generalizes multiple context words additional context word narrows sample size score sensitive noise reduce sample size zero 
address issue chose context word esl question 
esl question automatically selected context word eliminating problem word tap alternatives drain boil knock rap words 
remaining words year early spring farmers maple syrup trees context words 
problem context calculated score context evaluate context word 
example syrup highest score maple second highest maple syrup highest semantic similarity tap score syrup selected context word context calculating score choice

statistical approaches synonym recognition occurrence 
manning sch tze distinguish occurrence association collocation collocation refers grammatically bound elements occur particular order occurrence association refer general phenomenon words context 
order matter synonyms say occur saying collocated 
pointwise mutual information pmi primarily applied analysis collocation applications occurrence analysis

analyzing document collection scratch specifically cooccurrence information take advantage huge document collections indexed modern web search engines 
various measures semantic similarity word pairs proposed statistical unsupervised learning text techniques lexical databases hand built hybrid approaches combining statistics lexical information 
statistical techniques typically suffer sparse data problem perform poorly words relatively rare due scarcity data 
hybrid approaches attempt address problem supplementing sparse data information lexical database

landauer dumais claim mutual information analysis obtain score toefl questions source text chunk size lsa footnote 
appears tested conjecture plausible pmi ir achieves high performance brute force sheer size corpus text indexed altavista 
interesting test hypothesis

possibility 
strength lsa achieve relatively performance relatively little text 
expect smoothing compression produced svd 
access huge volumes data need smoothing 
interesting toefl performance score approximately performance lsa table 
difference performance lsa pmi ir comes near operator operator 
suggests difference lsa pmi ir due smaller chunk size pmi ir scores score 
test hypothesis lsa experiment toefl repeated source text encyclopedia smaller chunk size 
possibility 
latent semantic indexing lsi applies lsa information retrieval 
hope lsi improve performance ir essence automatically expanding query synonyms 
search say cars may able return document contains automobiles cars 
positive results lsi ir results trec trec text retrieval conferences show advantage lsi leading ir techniques 
conjectured trec queries unusually long detailed little room improvement lsi 
results reported pmi ir suggest alternative hypothesis 
trec systems technique called query expansion 
technique involves searching original query extracting terms top retrieved documents adding terms original query repeating search new expanded query 
hypothesize query expansion achieves essentially effect lsi apparent advantage lsi compared ir system uses query expansion 
lecture notes computer science say cars automobiles high semantic similarity expect automobiles cars relatively high see equation 
query cars retrieve document containing word automobiles 
means chance query expansion expand query cars new query contains automobiles 
testing hypothesis area 
hypothesis implies lsi tend perform better ir system query expansion significant difference ir system lsi ir system query expansion assuming factors equal 
applications limitation pmi ir network access time querying large web search engine may prohibitive certain applications high speed high priority access search engine 
possible pmi ir may achieve results significantly smaller document collection 
possibility hybrid system uses small local search engine high frequency words resorts large distant search engine rare words 
pmi ir may suitable tool aid construction lexical databases 
useful improving ir systems 
example ir system query expansion score screen candidate terms expanding query 
candidates extracted top retrieved documents current query expansion techniques 
current query expansion techniques may suggest suboptimal expansion terms top retrieved documents constitute relatively small noisy sample 
benefit validating suggested expansions pmi ir draw larger sample sizes 
am particularly interested applying pmi ir automatic keyword extraction 
helpful clues word phrase keyword document frequency word 
authors synonyms order avoid boring reader repetition 
courteous human readers complicates automatic keyword extraction 
am hoping pmi ir help cluster synonyms aggregate frequency counts resulting better keyword extraction 
introduced simple unsupervised learning algorithm recognizing synonyms 
algorithm uses known measure semantic similarity pmi 
new contribution observation pmi exploit huge document collections indexed modern web search engines
