memory glasses project attempt build wearable proactive context aware memory aid wearable sensors 
primary goal project produce ective short term memory aid reminder system requires minimum user attention 
secondary goals include development ective wearable computing interfaces development general framework building context aware wearable ubiquitous computing applications 
function system deliver reminders user timely situation appropriate way requiring intervention part user initial request reminded 
words system behaves reliable human secretary remembers reminder requests delivers appropriate circumstances 
system qualitatively di erent passive reminder system organizer records structures reminder requests act acquire user attention 
categorizing proactive reminder systems proactive situation appropriate reminder systems categorized complexity factors context taken account triggering reminder delivery 
factors include order increasing complexity time location user environment interaction user actions speci cally directed interacting reminder system 
time reminders simplest type proactive reminder system essentially alarm clock acting acquire user attention delivering reminders previously speci ed times 
electronic organizers alarm clock feature reminders may scheduled delivery speci ed times 
appointed time arrives general audible vibration alert produced attract user attention user acknowledge alert receive speci cs reminder 
time proactive reminder systems simple reliable limited 
reminders conditioned location actions user 
tasks location action xed matter reminders classic example bed side alarm clock works reliably alert user known location bed action sleeping time get 
user may choose ignore reminder course reschedule interacting button 
location time reminders location time reminder systems technically complex requiring additional channel information user location 
information acquired reliable di ers implementation implementation consequences reliability scope reminders delivered 
examples way location context may acquired include gps receivers outdoors tagged environments portable sensors wearable tags smart environments computer vision combinations types sensors 
techniques speci strengths weaknesses important degree infrastructure dependence 
able condition reminders location powerful addition proactive reminder system enabling location conditions time grocery store remind buy milk sophisticated location time conditions varying lead time reminder go meeting depending current location time probable time transit 
location context broadly useful important clue user activity 
example di erent activities take place home supermarket oce little point reminding user go meeting go grocery shopping user engaged activities indicated user current location 
location context di erentiate multiple activities take place space 
instance commotion location proactive reminder message delivery system developed chris schmandt uses gps determine location 
di erential gps location measurement high degree accuracy outdoors indoors 
commotion system identify location building level di erentiate part building vs 
means reminders ectively targeted activities segregated location building level grocery shopping vs working instance room level eating oce cafeteria vs meeting conference room 
likewise style active ir tag system possible comparatively ne grained location determination indoors amount location accuracy di erentiate di erent events occur location 
instance determining authors sitting oce workstation di erentiate writing thesis playing networked quake ii capture ag 
knowing user working resting conversation person obvious implications reminder delivery activities may take place unpredictable times cluttered oce 
activity location time reminders activity time reminder system able take account user activity state independent time location 
allows reminders triggered activity speaking remind calm allows system balance demands user attention 
instance system follow rule reminders delivered user engaged high attention task talking phone high risk task crossing street 
diculty recognizing user actions environmental conditions generally requires high bandwidth sensing sophisticated analysis 
computer vision techniques shown ective identifying user location action possible type sensing analysis easily portable wearable package independent outside infrastructure reasonable battery life performance 
goal memory glasses project produce activity location time proactive reminder system powerful recognize wide variety user activities environmental conditions exible trained recognize new user activities conditions easily minimum user intervention ergonomic worn engaged wide variety daily activities reliable trusted best possible user time attention
