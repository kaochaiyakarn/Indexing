get idea relative merits approaches placing precision recall space legend method improvement technique high precision frames keywords tfidf keywords recall deductive retrieval enumerated vocabulary semantic networks imprecise matching state art service retrieval 
high recall extent search engine retrieves items interested avoiding false negatives precision extent tool retrieves items interested avoiding false positives 
search engines look items web pages contain keywords query 
sophisticated variants technique known tfidf look items searched keywords common usual increasing precision 
typically manual effort needed list items search engines queries specified needing know specialized query language 
keyword approaches notoriously prone low precision imperfect recall 
completely irrelevant items may include keywords query leading low precision 
possible query keywords semantically equivalent syntactically different words searched items leading reduced recall 
imagine example searching service offer loan cover house addition 
entering keywords loan house google com keyword search service example returns documents 
results promising loan calculator mortgage calculator somewhat connected loan granting organization third hit points report campaign arms trade fourth shows junior high school calculate 
enter query altavista com uses tfidf get hits 
hits talk loans provide loan service 
point classes discuss loan calculation techniques provide sort mortgage calculator 
course somewhat misleading web search engines assess performance keyword service retrieval engine 
web contains services 
documents loan calculation classes mentioned provision services 
take poor precision queries indicator happen system relies solely techniques retrieving services 
mortgage calculator useful instrument 
provide service analysis loan provision 
assume systems techniques show low precision 
techniques developed address problems 
require items queries described pre enumerated vocabulary 
increases probability terms query desired items increasing recall 
approach semantic nets wordnet capture semantic relationships words synonym antonym hypernym hyponym increase breadth query increase recall potentially reduce precision result suboptimal recall networks focus purely linguistic relationships 
search engines google com prioritize retrieved documents linked documents contain searched keywords way increasing precision 
text search engines allow imprecise matching retrieving items contain query keywords potentially increasing recall cost reduced precision 
see keyword approaches achieve fairly high recall cost low precision 
key underlying problem keywords poor way capture semantics query item 
semantics captured accurately precision increase 
frame approaches emerged way doing 
frame consists attribute value pairs describing properties item 
example shows frame integer averaging service items queries described frames matches represent items textual property values match query 
commercial service search technologies aware jini salutation uddi frame approach typically partially pre enumerated vocabulary service types properties 
sophisticated search tools emerging research community larks limited semantic nets returning match input type service equal generalization input type specified query 
frame approaches increase precision fairly modest cost requiring services modeled frames 
description service find average list integers input integers output real execution time number inputs msec frame description integer sorting service 
frame approach taken step deductive retrieval approach service properties inputs outputs function performance expressed formally logic name set insert syntax set insert elem old new input types elem old set output types semantics new set precond member elem old member elem new member old member new member new member old elem service description deductive retrieval retrieval consists finding items proved achieve functionality described query 
assume non redundant pre enumerated vocabulary logical predicates complete formalization relevant service query properties deductive retrieval theory achieve perfect precision perfect recall 
approach faces serious practical difficulties 
prohibitively difficult model semantics non trivial queries services formal logic 
simple set insert function shown non trivial formalize correctly imagine trying formally model behavior microsoft word accounting package 
second difficulty proof process implicit kind search high computational complexity making extremely slow 
belief limitations especially deductive retrieval unrealistic scalable general purpose service search approach 
approaches exist apply specialized applications 
retrieval software components selected comparing actual behavior desired behavior 
approach suitable contexts observing selected samples behavior sufficient prune service set 
approach exploiting process ontologies challenge seen framed able capture service query semantics substantively increase precision reducing recall making unrealistically difficult people express semantics 
central claim goals achieved sophisticated process ontologies 
capturing function service process model 
service model indexed facilitate subsequent retrieval placing components subtasks appropriate sections ontology 
queries expressed partial process models 
matching algorithm finds services process models match query semantic relationships encoded process ontology 
approach viewed having functional architecture index service define process ontology find matches define query functional architecture proposed service retrieval technology 
consider element functional architecture sections 
define process ontology approach differs previous efforts highly expressive process models arranged fully typed process ontology 
key concepts underlying ontology extension developed mit process handbook project 
handbook process knowledge repository development center coordination science ccs past years 
handbook active development highly distributed group scientists teachers students sponsors diverse purposes adding new process descriptions teaching classes business process re design 
believe current handbook process ontology represents excellent starting point indexing line services focused business processes high proportion line services address 
handbook takes advantage simple powerful concepts capture organize process knowledge attributes ports decomposition dependencies exceptions specialization 
process attributes process modeling techniques handbook allows processes annotated attributes capture information textual description typical performance values long process takes execute pre post conditions 
decomposition process modeling techniques handbook uses notion decomposition process modeled collection activities turn broken decomposed 
ports ports describe behavior activity 
describe types resources activity uses produces result important assessing match service specification query 
dependencies key concept coordination viewed management dependencies activities 
dependency include associated coordination mechanism simply process manages resource flow coordinates activities connected dependency 
task inputs outputs represented ports tasks 
key advantage representing processes concepts allow highlight core activities process away details coordinate allowing compact service descriptions sacrificing significant content 
exceptions processes typically characteristic ways fail cases associated schemes anticipating avoiding detecting resolving 
captured approach annotating processes characteristic exceptions mapping exceptions processes describing exceptions handled 
specialization final key concept processes key elements ports resources attributes exceptions appear type taxonomies generic classes extreme increasingly specialized ones process models fully typed 
taxonomies place items similar semantics processes similar purposes close way books similar subjects appear close library processes vary identifiable dimension grouped bundles processes appear bundle 
bundles subsume notion faceted classification known software component retrieval community bundles facets include ontology branch opposed simply flat set keywords allowing varying abstraction levels synonyms 
shown activity defined specifying decomposition activities contains interface defined ports contains dependencies sub activities attributes defined entities shown 
activity linked kinds exceptions face exceptions linked turn processes handle anticipate avoid detect resolve 
legend relation relation contains specializes contains specializes coordinated process dependency port contains raises handled exception connects contains contains specializes partial meta model process ontology attributes shown 
type entity specialization hierarchy placed making fully typed process description approach 
specialization hierarchy processes resources exceptions 
sell loan process example specialization general sell financial service process 
furthermore specializes specific processes sell reserve credit sell credit card sell mortgage sell financial service specialization activity sell loan sell savings investment service sell management service sell account access services sell reserve credit sell credit card sell loan sell letter credit sell mortgage sell credit line sell account sell certificate deposit sell retirement plan sell mutual funds sell payroll management sell account management services sell foreign exchange services sell merchant credit card services sell atm access sell telephone sell online computer access sell night deposit specialization hierarchy loan sell escrow management sell management elements sell loan process member specialization hierarchy 
analyze credit example specialization general perform financial analysis specializes specific processes analyze scoring analyze pe ratio process representation equal greater formal expressiveness full fledged process modeling languages idef pif psl greater expressiveness frame languages previous service retrieval efforts virtue adding important concepts full typing resource dependencies ports task decompositions exceptions 
growing handbook database currently includes process descriptions ranging specific university purchasing department generic resource allocation multi criteria decision making 
subset database containing representative selection process models exception related information accessible web ccs mit edu index services services indexed process ontology may retrieved readily 
indexing service approach comes placing associated process model components attributes ports dependencies subtasks exceptions appropriate place ontology 
fact substantial process ontology exists process handbook means parties wishing index service construct service specification existing elements ontology customizing necessary 
imagine example want index service sells 
handbook ontology includes general sell loan process amount customer information loan analyze establish loan conditions obtain commitments default loan payment execute loan contract loan selling service process model 
legend loan activity connector port exception exception sell loan process model includes requisite elements including key analyzing establishing loan conditions obtaining commitments executing loan contract 
includes ports describing process inputs size loan amount collateral provided loan information customer outputs loan 
mortgage provider need create specialization sell loan process changes specific mortgage loans specifying types customer information wishes type analysis performed elements defined specializing existing elements process ontology 
simplify example omitted dependencies exceptions 
amount description real estate customer information mortgage analyze value establish mortgage conditions obtain commitments default mortgage payment execute mortgage contract mortgage selling service process model 
legend loan activity connector port exception exception handbook project developed sophisticated windows tools process indexing define specialization principle refined nearly years daily 
tools process models indexed matter minutes 
note modeling service needs theory account possible uses service may put 
users may side effect service may key attribute 
pick example dog walking service may desired way provide dog exercise simply way sure dog cared owner 
suggest process model needs indexed specializations representing possible uses difficult best 
shall see define query algorithms query mutation operators potentially retrieve processes explicitly indexed serving purpose reducing service indexing burden 
take manual indexing approach described important step 
key criterion successful service retrieval approach minimizing manual effort involved listing new services search engine 
ideally services classified automatically 
automatic classification predicated having similarity metric place process class similar 
previous efforts automatic service classification similarity metrics automatically calculated word frequency statistics natural language documentation service manually developed frame models service approach scalable manual effort needed approach results higher retrieval precision frame models seen better capture service semantics 
ontology approach improve approaches developing tools semi automated classification process models 
process models form flowcharts example typically created part standard programming practice cases services want index process models defined 
models may cases classified kind process ontology 
greater expressiveness process models compared standard frame service models process models include task decomposition information example frame models means define similarity metrics accurate previously 
metrics word frequency statistics augmented semantic networks compute similarity natural language elements combined taxonomic reasoning graph theoretic similarity measures assess structural type similarities 
believe technique greatly speed manual service indexing providing human user short list possible locations service 
ideally allow human user taken loop entirely 
fully automated indexing turns feasible imagine online services indexed internet worms analogous currently keyword search tools 
define queries course possible query definition entirely services indexed process ontology 
theory simply browse ontology find services interested 
experience process handbook suggests browsing slow difficult experienced human users size process ontology 
problem exacerbated online services space services large dynamic 
address challenge begun define query language called pql process query language designed specifically retrieving full fledged process models process ontology 
process models straightforwardly viewed entity relationship diagrams entities tasks connected relationships subtask 
pql queries built combinations types clauses check entities relationships entity entity isa entity type test predicate relationship source entity relationship type target entity test predicate clause type matches entity type 
second primitive matches relationship type entities 
bracketed item replaced variable format string bound matching entity passed subsequent query clauses 
predicates pruning constitutes match 
consider simple examples 
imagine searching loan service accepts real estate collateral includes follows entity proc isa sell loan finds specialization sell loan relationship proc port port looks port accepts real entity port isa input port estate collateral relationship port propagates resource res entity res isa real estate entity port attribute attr entity attr isa name relationship attr value val test val collateral relationship proc port port looks port produces entity port isa output port money relationship port propagates resource res entity res isa money query query mortgage services 
type query capabilities frame query languages especially enhanced semantic network wordnet type service 
existing linguistically oriented semantic networks include service oriented process taxonomy incorporated handbook expect recall optimal approach 
go substantially ontology approach 
query example retrieves financing solution internet step entity proc isa sell loan finds specialization sell loan relationship proc subtask sub sub process internet entity sub isa internet process relationship proc port port looks port accepts real entity port isa input port estate collateral relationship port propagates resource res entity res isa real estate entity port attribute attr entity attr isa name relationship attr value val test val collateral relationship proc port port looks port produces entity port isa output port money relationship port propagates resource res entity res isa money query query internet financing services 
useful capability searching services achieve purpose achieved frame languages capture process decompositions 
novel powerful feature ontology approach ability search service handles exceptions 
query refined example adding clause searches loan processes provide insurance handling payment defaults entity proc isa sell loan relationship proc exception exc entity exc isa payment default relationship exc handled proc entity proc isa insurance process query query refinement searches payment default insurance 
searching services exception handling processes supported techniques 
see short ontology approach offers substantively greater query expressiveness keyword frame approaches virtue having substantive process taxonomy able represent process decompositions exception handling 
pql query language fairly verbose requires users familiar syntax 
intuitive interfaces suitable human users possible 
approach exploits process ontology 
straightforward translate process model pql query looks service function 
users handbook process modeling tools express query combination refinement existing elements process ontology way new services indexed 
advantage specifying query way elements process ontology give user additional ideas concerning look 
looking mortgage service example initially think check service provides mortgage insurance 
define query specialization generic sell loan process may note process possible payment default exception result inspired search mortgage services handle exception way user prefers 
possibilities exist 
reduce query definition burden allowing users enter queries restricted subset english approach applied successfully traditional database access 
substantial progress defining graphical metaphors query definition see 
approaches course combined example simple natural language query returns candidates classes selected refined define final complete query 
find matches algorithm retrieving matches pql query straightforward 
clauses pql query tried order clause executed variable binding environment accumulated previous clauses 
sets bindings survive represent matching services 
key problem accounted call modeling differences 
cases service may modeled way semantically equivalent syntactically match pql query 
service model may example include subtask levels process decomposition query subtask may just level 
service model may express resource flows captured query single resource flow 
service model may simply missing type resource flow information tested query 
problem exacerbated possibility multiple service ontologies 
pointed expect increasing prevalence line ontologies structure kinds knowledge including service descriptions certainly partially mapped ontologies opposed single universally adopted 
increase potential modeling differences queries services defined different ontologies 
order avoid false negatives provide retrieval scheme tolerant modeling differences 
explore purpose semantics preserving query mutation operators 
imagine library operators syntactically mutate pql query way largely preserves semantics 
examples operators include allow type specification general allow subtask number levels task decomposition hierarchy allow siblings cousins task constitute match relax constraints parameter value remove subtask mutation operators broaden search allow discovery novel alternatives 
example apply mutation operator query searches sell processes just sell loan processes 
result additional hits sell real estate service sell property raise money sell real estate lease lease property generate funds 
assuming want raise money extension additional options desirable property sold 
second option 
key point mutation operation broadened search way semantically motivated avoiding decline precision typical imprecise matching techniques 
second important potential mutation operators address incomplete indexing issue described section 
case user may searching processes serve purpose represented single element process ontology 
example may searching ways raise money different options may share single generalization 
address issue mutation operators define query searches processes similar substeps regardless part process ontology indexed 
example search processes offer money kind collateral 
return options services getting mortgage raising money stock market 
contributions described set ideas exploit process model representations service semantics plus process ontologies improve service retrieval 
ideas offer potential important benefits increased precision approach differs previous efforts models service semantics fully keyword frame approaches imposing unrealistic modeling burden implied deductive retrieval approaches 
translates greater retrieval precision 
increased recall modeling differences queries service descriptions reduce recall addressed novel way query mutation operators 
query definition service indexing process models potentially burdensome simply entering keywords believe existing define process modeling techniques developed handbook project coupled proposed advances search algorithms automated process model classification result acceptable increase query definition service indexing burden traded increase retrieval precision recall 
date developed initial version pql interpreter small set semantics preserving query mutation operators demonstrated viability query process model concept 
evaluated pql performance detail clear primitive query elements low computational complexity 
query performance addition increased known techniques query clause re ordering 
efforts involve comparing precision recall approach search engines refining query definition mutation schemes implementing evaluating automated process classification techniques
