advantage desired properties decomposition scheme re components intuitively simple 
proposed scheme morphological shape decomposition uses sequence structuring elements sequence set transformations 
obtained decomposition called generalized morphological segmentation 
special case decomposition obtained identity set transformation called generalized reduced morphological skeleton 
authors proven decomposition optimal class invertible morphological decompositions 
optimal sense minimizing probability error reconstruction presence noise 
concluding remarks decades resulted enormous amount related shape analysis
