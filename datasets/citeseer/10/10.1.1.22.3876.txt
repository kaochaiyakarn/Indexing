past years large number robotic agents physical systems capable sensori motor control built order investigate bottom approach artificial intelligence see overview :10.1.1.38.7186
important results achieved particularly behavior oriented architectures learning methods neural networks genetic algorithms 
largely open question robots may reach sufficient complexity order qualify cognitive agents 
experiments focused low level tasks obstacle avoidance navigation difficult preclude cognitive tasks 
approach pushing ahead taken example cog project increase complexity robots adding sensory channels degrees freedom 
approach exploring hypothesis communication full fledged language necessary stepping stone cognitive intelligence

adaptive language games heart approach notion language game 
language game involves agents speaker hearer context consists agents objects situations 
different kinds language games played depending goals participating agents want achieve 
game pursued experiments reported speaker identify object certain context linguistic means 
call game naming game 
initially extra linguistic means pointing bootstrap language 
language games allow speaker get hearer perform certain action ask hearer information basic scenario play naming game participants follow specific scenario consists steps 
making contact agents contact 
assumes role speaker hearer 
agents physically close automatically shared context 

topic identification agent perceives surrounding environment sensors identifies set objects constitute context 
speaking agent chooses object context topic conversation 
draws attention topic extra linguistic means example pointing 
hearer identifies topic 

perception agent sensory experience different objects terms features identifies distinctive feature set distinguishes topic objects context 
case distinctive feature set appropriate 

encoding speaker chooses distinctive feature set example smallest encodes expression 
encoding means smallest set words expresses features distinctive feature set searched lexicon 

decoding hearer decodes expression means looks words lexicon feature set covering words 
words ambiguous lexicon word may different meanings typically possible feature set resulting decoding process 

feedback hearer compares decoded feature sets distinctive feature sets expecting 
distinctive feature sets equal decoded feature set language games ends success hearer gives positive feedback 
game ends failure hearer signals failure 
scenario assumes agents perceptual apparatus categorising sensory experiences identifying distinctive feature sets lexicon associates features feature sets words vice versa 
precisely interested problem may originate 
initially agents repertoire perceptual distinctions lexicon 
build side activity language game methods described subsections 
originating distinctions agent series sensory motor channels direct output sensors result automatic low level sensory processes dynamically evolving contents internal states left right motor command streams 
sensory motor channels hardware low level routines 
channel discrimination tree divides output channel distinct regions 
assumed discrimination trees binary 
node tree constitutes feature 
feature denoted string agent channel region subregion refers feature associated channel agent 
initially discrimination trees 
part perception phase agent engages discrimination game 
sensorimotor states object discrimination trees 
result set features channel contains active data object 
different sets find possible distinctive feature sets distinguish feature set topic feature sets objects 
fails distinctive feature set built existing discrimination trees new distinction created subdivision nodes discrimination tree active categorisation process 
choice nodes expanded arbitrary 
agent keeps track features success discrimination 
forgetting process eliminates nodes turn useful 
approach generator diversity separate process maintains eliminates features feature population 
earlier software experiments shown method stabilises successful repertoire discriminations 
new objects new sensori motor channels new agents may time enter causing discrimination trees expanded adapted need arises 
note agent builds discrimination trees 
similarities due fact agents operate environment guarantee complete coherence 
coherence reached feature additional criterion survival discussed detail 
originating lexicon lexicon consists set word meaning pairs meaning consists feature set 
agent lexicon agent directly inspect lexicon 
agent maintains word meaning pair successful 
encoding speaker prefer word meaning pairs succesful 
discrimination game results series possible distinctive feature sets chosen speaker 
feature set encoded speaker decoded hearer 
things go wrong process failure results appropriate actions 
speaker word certain feature set 
case speaker allowed construct new word formed random combination drawn prior alphabet associate lexicon feature set 
happens low probability word may exist population feature set 

hearer may lack word speaker 
case hearer infer possible feature sets meant word distinctive feature sets expecting 
simplest situation feature necessary distinguish topic objects meaning unequivocally known 
words known 
meaning missing words reconstructed remaining unknowns 
may distinctive feature set inevitable ambiguity lexicon hearer 
ambiguities success determine word meaning pairs common 

feature sets decoded hearer match expected distinctive feature sets 
means word meaning pairs shared agents 
successful word meaning pairs success incremented incremented diminishes 

feature set decoded hearer match expected distinctive feature sets 
case hearer extends lexicon procedure situation 
note approach 
agents create infer word meaning pairs 
pairs survive depends success determined agents adopted word meaning pairs 
typically see phase transition word starts dominate expression particular meaning 
phase transition due positive feedback loop inherent system word success 
software simulations reported shown group agents converges common lexicon sufficient number adaptive naming games 
new agents may enter time due adaptive nature discrimination games new features may enter repertoire possible meanings 
results turn challenge implementing algorithms physically embodied robots 
physical implementation known software simulations guarantee methods real world settings 
problems encountered physical implementation language games enormous
