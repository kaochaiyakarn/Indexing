aim maximise effectiveness visual communication framing talking subject appropriately effectively attempting emulate automatically skills camera operator 
framing subject 
typical fixed camera setup allow movement subject resulting unsatisfying wide angle view 
alternatively automatic framing altogether compelling view maintained 
core task camera control 
pan tilt zoom controlled physically case fixed cameras web cameras mapping image subwindow controlled 
maintaining lock moving subject relatively uncontrolled environment notoriously difficult advances needed live system capable running reliably tens minutes time 
promising approach active contours uses probabilistic modelling particle filtering non gaussian monte carlo inference deal visual clutter 
alternative approach extends affine correlation matching optic flow image exemplars stabilisation 
microphones case telephony compelling try stereo microphones help determine activity position speakers jointly analysis video images 
stereo sound vision complementary ways sound rapidly alert computer system approximate whereabouts speaker vision expensive locating talking head precisely

audiovisual fusion research progress audiovisual fusion key features 
stereo sound processing audio setup consists simply pair microphones placed symmetrically camera speaking subject 
generalised cross correlation applied determine values delay left right signals 
observation likelihood model cross correlation values transformed probabilistic likelihoods modelling aural clutter arising reverberation uniformly distributed space imposing mutual exclusivity data associations 
approach requires background noise calibrated learning statistical distribution audio responses absence speech 
state space model audio source modelled object threedimensional space sharing common state space image processing essential fusion 
microphone pair calibrated geometrically order possible predict audio delay 
data fusion presence clutter audio video domains appropriate particle filtering fuse modalities proves effective 
results obtained ping pong sequence summarised key frames 
case visual measurements particles remain focussed subject initialised regardless subject speaking 
hand sound measurements focus processing jumps back forth subjects take turns conversation 
suitable behaviour teleconferencing system determine focus attention steerable camera 
interframe stabilisation exemplars approach tracking motion discrete features highly effective 

study follows substantial line research tracking interframe matching affine transformations 
key ingredient background modelling image differencing 
trade static models interframe models matching 
seek find synthesis best modality 
static models suffer difficulty capturing range variability including shape illumination variations 
interframe models exploit highly dependable constraint changes successive frames great 
interframe matching effective short timescales typically seconds 
vision system intended indefinite live operation opposed processing short video clips suffer accumulation incremental errors procedure numerical integration 
requires form error stabilisation occasional reduction error static properties object tracked
