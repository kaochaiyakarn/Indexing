take database approach information retrieval gf vb vw tie retrieval model physical data structure specify retrieval model declarative way 
information need user represented ir query natural language consists set keywords entered user 
system keyword set modeled unary database relation parameter database query expression represents actual retrieval request

choices form basis approach 
firstly interested top queries common form ir queries adopt precision note system limits relations query terms soon possible 
evaluating remaining relations completely limitation slows responsiveness due large size data dealing 
note term top query database designation basis quality notion 
precise average precision metric includes positional information just certain fraction top relevant 
don recall quality metric dependent note recall increased choosing large secondly choose terms highest document frequencies part neglect query processing just random subset data 
terms considered discriminative provide numerically significant term contribution score document score function 
means terms usually significant impact final ranking arbitrary document 
furthermore terms take space tf relation ignoring terms delivers largest cost reduction 
precise model uses fraction terms lower document frequencies terms ignored main steering variable
