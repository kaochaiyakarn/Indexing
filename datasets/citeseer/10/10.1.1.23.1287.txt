demonstrate perceptual interaction changes pitch loudness perceived asymmetries directional change 
experiments show changes loudness influence judgments pitch change changes pitch influence loudness change increases loudness judged change equivalent decreases

auditory variables loudness pitch timbre represent data variables 
data variables represented changing auditory parameters auditory stream 
potential problem approach orthogonality changes variable may influence perception changes variable 
example numerous studies shown auditory dimensions pitch loudness timbre interact perceptually 
changes dimensions influence perception changes 
variables represent data values distorted perception underlying data potential result 
complicating issue evidence suggesting changes single auditory dimension perceived differently direction duration change 
example shown perceptual asymmetries rising falling intensity changes equal magnitude 
despite evidence directional asymmetries perceived stimulus change dimensional interaction perceptual dimensions little examined phenomena remain perceptual dimensions mapped quantitative dimensions interest display 
example may untrained listeners great difficulty giving accurate estimates change somewhat unfamiliar dimensions frequency intensity spectral content perform tasks easily accurately perceptual dimensions mapped familiar concrete variables 
perceptual level interaction auditory dimensions thought stem context created dimension pitch dimension loudness perceived 
example loud sound perceived differently context created high pitch context created lower pitch 
mechanisms processes perceptual dimensions interact matter debate 
applied perspective importance accurately mapping data variables acoustic variables suggests greater understanding perceptual interaction pursued 
understanding facilitate effective sonification techniques particularly situations precision critical

discussion current results demonstrate perceptual interaction pitch loudness change implications sonification techniques 
frequency intensity changed direction perceived amount total stimulus change greater dimensions changed opposite directions despite equal amount physical change conditions 
suggests situations precision critical great care taken minimize effect dimensional interaction perceived changes variables 
significant effect direction changes intensity 
directions frequency change sounds got louder perceived change sounds got softer 
perceptual asymmetry demonstrated physically equivalent signals suggests lower level acoustic dimensions frequency intensity pose potential problem representing data simple acoustic attributes 
addition simple psychoacoustic findings perceived asymmetries stimulus change experiment implications sonification applications sonification design theory 
experiments listeners realistic task data variables represented changes pitch intensity 
experiments shown perceptual dimensions interact knowledge study show perceptual dimensions mapped quantitative dimensions interest interaction persists 
experiments significant influence dimension interest perceived stock price simultaneously changing dimension trading volume 
significant differences perceived change cases physical change identical 
positive implication results findings effect congruent acoustic changes salient incongruent changes acoustic change single dimension 
situations changes state variable particularly critical duplicate mapping frequency intensity variable provide improved performance 
findings limited simulated changes trading volume stock prices 
true market conditions produce price volume interactions regular stimuli 
results experiment suggest perceptual interaction persists stimuli exhibit complexities durations far exceed typically traditional psychoacoustic experiments 
current results limited dimensional interaction auditory domain interactions clearly occur visual domain considered design visual displays 
evidence suggest cross modal associations congruency effects exist audition modalities 
multi modal displays variety different environments
