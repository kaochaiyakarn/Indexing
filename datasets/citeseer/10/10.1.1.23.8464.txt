section overview agent information food chain 
agents information food chain overview representing information web requires joint representation language data web building wrappers longer necessary 
current situation xml 
xml suitable task current hype xml suggest semantics common xml languages just parse tree documents useful html parse tree 
general xml creation wrappers necessary 
specific language necessary formal agent communication 
data exchange web necessary specification terminology particular domain data 
raw data available web explanation semantics useless tag carrier website mean starting time flight landing time 
ontologies fridman noy means knowledge sharing reuse capture semantics domain interest 
ontologies consensual formal specifications vocabularies describe specific domain facilitate information interchange information systems 
ontology available describing possible data need multiple ontologies different application domains dtds biztalk www biztalk com regarded limited kind ontology 
dtds describe grammar structure document content 
ontologies just formal data web needs exchanged

webpage annotation process creates set annotated webpages available automated agent achieve tasks 
course annotation process social component effort generating annotation webpage order magnitude lower creation webpage incentive spend extra effort 
incentive creation annotation metadata webpage visibility web community web portal presents community interest distributed web outside word concise manner 
data collected annotated webpages simplifies task maintaining community web portal drastically changes incorporated automatically manual required 
automated agent needs sub components important task agent integration data distributed information sources 
need describe relationships data declarative way new agent programmed new task agent needs inference engine evaluation rules queries see example 
inference engine coupled metadata repository memory agent retrieved information cached 
furthermore automated agent browses web usually encounter data formulated unknown ontologies

overview agents information food chain describe essential parts greater detail section 
information food chain components agents ontology construction tool ontologies engineering artifacts constructing ontology involves human interaction 
means necessary keep costs ontology creation low possible 
ontology construction tool necessary provide means construct ontologies cost effective manner 
ontologies evolve change time knowledge needs capabilities change reducing acquisition maintenance cost ontologies important task 
examples ontology editors prot framework customized knowledge base system construction grosso webonto framework domingue 
webonto aiming distributed development ontologies 
webonto supports collaborative browsing creation editing ontologies providing direct manipulation interface displays ontological expressions 
tool creating ontologies web agent applications 
webpage annotation tool creating formal data web costly process 
important goal information food chain reduce cost ontology data creation possible 
annotation process requires tools support user creation kind data 
biggest source information web today html pages 
creation explicit ontology data metadata html pages requires effort done naively 
html pages find web created visual html editor annotators know tools 
html editors focus presentation information need support creation ontology metadata describe content information 
information food chain needs practical easy ontology semantic annotation tool html pages 
basic tool created project ontobroker decker fensel benjamins 
extension java html editor allows normal browsing editing html page supports annotation html page ontology metadata 
annotator select portion text webpage choose add semantic annotation inserted html source 
significant annotation tasks basic annotation tool sufficient 
takes long time annotate large pages significant improvement reported compared manual task 
practical tool exploit information extraction techniques semi automatic metadata creation 
precision linguistic processing technology far perfect reasonably exact automatic annotation possible 
exists currently linguistic processing technology highly appropriate help users annotation tasks alembic day neumann 
sufficient give user choice annotate phrase ontological expressions 
resources wordnet fellbaum results obtained scalable knowledge composition skc project mitra provide highlevel background knowledge guide annotation support 
collection similar pages semantically annotated 
document templates built annotations simplify creation collections annotated documents considerably 
document templates enable reuse annotations document template created 
benefit intensive ongoing efforts extended mark language xml developments 
xml promotes creation semantic markup 
definition mapping concepts ontology erdmann xml documents treated formal information sources ontology articulation toolkit order solve task involves consulting multiple information sources separate ontologies automated agent needs bridge semantic gap ontologies finds web 
scalable knowledge composition project skc mitra developed tools support expert process defining rules link different ontologies ontologies different sources differ terminology semantic relationships 
rules define new articulation ontology serve application translates terms involved intersection source domain 
typical disjoint source domains important articulation logistics example air cargo 
information produced source domain response task reported application inverse process 
results translated consistent terminology application produce integrated result 
major advantage skc approach terms source ontologies aligned globally consistent 
aligning just ontologies completely requires major effort practical application ongoing maintenance 
instance united airlines british want agree fully common ontology logistics expert easily link terms matching semantics define rules resolve partial match problems 
partial matches occur terms differ scope say airline includes definition cargo 
partial match dealt having rules articulation indicate portions partially matching concepts belonging different ontologies semantically similar combined 
articulation provides scalability 
hundreds domains just logistics area different applications need various combinations global consistency approach require domains interact time consistent 
single application take responsibility government mandate national semantic consistency french try 
automated agent come new domain ontology prior knowledge 
customer needs information extracted new domain 
hard problem agent possess prior information semantics terms relationships new information source 
address problem methods generation dynamic articulations necessary needed basis 
allow creation working articulation ontologies linkages source ontologies 
enduser expertise perform articulation specialist expert understands linkages domains needed 
instance frequent traveler today deal domain differences airlines 
agents inference system combining information different source enables new applications exploits available information possible 
requires inference techniques enable ontology language relate different pieces information 
agents inference system provides means effective efficient reasoning agents 
expect technology enable agents reason distributed available knowledge 
metadata web usually distributed added value generated combining metadata metadata offerings example transport

combining pieces information agents inference system deduce connection available washington dc frankfurt explicitly stated 
please note simple rules evaluable commercial databases inability perform recursion simple prolog systems potential infinite looping 
fundamental type system usable task 
inference engines reduce metadata creation maintenance cost 
having state single assertion metadata explicitly leads large metadata creation maintenance overhead 
tools techniques necessary help reduce amount stated metadata implicit metadata decker 
implicit metadata derived known metadata general background knowledge stated ontologies 
exploit axioms defined ontologies available metadata automated agent needs reasoning capabilities 
properties reasoning capabilities carefully chosen 
reasoning mechanism powerful intractable computational properties limited approach enable full potential inference 
deductive database techniques proven compromise tradeoffs
