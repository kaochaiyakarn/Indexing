orbit collaboration environment section explore implications framework basis systems design discussion design orbit 
orbit open toolkit environment support collaborative activities built concepts locales framework 
central concept orbit group zone representation virtual locale network 
users may group zones tailored furnished particular group social world 
illustrates base orbit layer architecture artifacts layer layer contains objects tools stored variety repositories manipulated orbit 
examples repositories include file systems cvs repositories databases web 
group zones layer group zones called locales earlier papers gather artifacts tools events people form ongoing context particular group 
views layer user participates simultaneously group zones 
users different intensities view zone 
example keeping group activities objects clearly focus high intensity view keeping eye group activities 
orbit architecture objects lower intensity views 
intensity user controlled measure view zone 
high intensity view usually includes objects awareness users doing audio video presence 
lower intensity views usually selectively exclude parts information 
screen dump composite orbit user interface 
users employ navigator panel provide access group zones awareness information control group zones views 
workspace panel tile objects 
composite orbit user interface view group zones time 
colour chips relate artifacts zones 
windows displayed video panels audio panels various awareness widgets 
user mixture views group zones including video view zone mixture objects view zones user belongs 
ubiquitous scalable underlying event service provides extensive awareness information turn projected user awareness widgets assuming user selected view information visible 
current implementation orbit focuses exclusively foundations individual view mutuality aspects framework 
locales manifest group zones 
crucial distinction locale reflects site means general locale broader simply computer place including example physical extension 
group zone furnished objects drawn underlying repositories mechanisms controlling access membership supports individual view view manipulation mechanisms mutuality variety awareness presence indicators widgets
