dirty dozen team consists player agents online coach 
players low level skills world model publicly available code cmu team 
team behavior speci ed new strategy formalization language sfl extension standard coach language 
allows modify behavior easily team online developed di erent teams 
introduce main concepts sfl possible system modules interprete run sfl speci cations 
give outline online coach 
specifying behavior agents multi agent systems possible domain experts 
proposes new method specifying team strategy way adjustments human designer online coach easy 
strategy formalization language sfl extension standard coach language clang enables players di erent teams communicate 
sfl extends clang terms expressibility low level high level concepts 
dirty dozen team implemented sfl system described 
strategy formalization language system order easily handle coach messages sfl completely subsumes clang retains syntactical structure 
main message types focus info advice messages 
syntactically just semantics di er info messages contain knowledge behavior teams advice messages contain directives behave certain situations 
syntax messages token token tokens condit ion direct iv direct iv direct iv en denotes time live token valid 
condition denotes situation directives denote directives set players 
basically tokens production rules 
sfl extensions condition directive tokens described 
language concepts clang sucient implement behavior team 
concepts general sfl contains concepts important implementing teams 
clang advices may uttered online coach elegant concise 
due extendibility clang sfl created adding new concept primitives clear semantics 
introduces abstractions constant uniform numbers clang denote players variables symbols situation speci player denotation closestplayertoball 
extend practical expressibility clang possible concisely express mark 
list possible 
sfl opponent ball mark 
lot complicated clang advices refer di erent players certain situations closest player ball 
concept distances clang advice simulate distance increasing circles ball 
sfl short statement primitive symbol closestplayertoball constant uniform numbers 
sfl concepts extend set situation speci cation primitives making conditions depend stamina agent ball velocity fact ball 
set actions extended new features parameters existing actions velocities positioning actions modes passing 
clang continually extended concepts sfl relative positions included publishing 
complete syntax sfl see nal documentation 
implementation actual implementation team just possible implementation handle sfl speci cation 
strategy formalization language system works follows 
behavior team speci ed set advice tokens rules condition ects 
cycle module called matcher evaluates conditions rules world model agent 
rules conditions true actual cycle contain directives agent labeled active 
time rules active 
module called selector decide rule executed 
basic idea rules heuristically evaluated clang levels actions directives conditions assigned tness values summed 
certain actions promising higher tness marking action level 
directives refer di erent sets players speci player set higher directive tness directives level 
tness directive refers team tness subset tness situation speci player symbol 
rules speci ed team implementation xed done manually automated assignment straight forward 
third level conditions basically way save world knowledge rules incorporate selector 
necessary specify rule agent mark opponent teammate 
certain common sense heuristics level assign tness value rule 
implemented sfl rules team contain certain amounts common sense knowledge explicitly 
selector execute rule highest tness rules contains force ag denotes rule executed condition true 
action handed ector module encapsulates strategic actions executes appropriate low level skills 
case pass action example ector take care agent gets close ball turned proper direction 
coach advices added rulebase arrive communication channel evaluated cycles rules 
assigned tness high xed 
possible team designer specify rules overwritten coach advices assigning higher tness coach advice tness 
online coach main concerns designing dirty dozen online coach compatible foreign teams 
possible clang robocup rst time 
coach contribute ways opponent team modelling advising agents change behaviour appropriately facilitating coordination coach central role communication global noiseless information receives 
coach looks patterns opponent player positions goalie information sent agents position strategically 
unfortunately requires lot inference agents side rely team designers having incorporated mechanism players 
promising way send information explicit advice behave certain situations 
encapsulates inference tactics formations team level coach 
coach assigns tasks agent mark opponent defense situations 
coach know priori players defenders model teams order identify opponent forwards team defenders 
assignment defenders forwards spatial distribution eld player assigned opponent tends defensive situations 
experiments showed wise change parts tactics teams tuned tactics coach able detect rst place 
marking assignment coach advices new formation positions defenders position assigned opponent players 
defensive formation tuned marking assignments 
note hard achieve distributed way agent decide player mark agents incomplete noisy visual information communicate order avoid marking opponents twice 
considering small set primitive features clang sfl playing soccer successfully having best concepts domain knowledge regarding handle existing concepts situations 
elaborate selector module choose rules dynamically 
lead better integration coach advices handled xed tness values 
typically formulated sfl detailed speci clang express rule selection needs 
players handle explicit advices coach ignore opponent modelling information 
inference mechanism uses information infer behave certain information opponent tactics useful implementing coach 
additionally coach contest showed coach needs observe messages uence team behavior react appropriately 
opponent modelling supported modelling team 
year kept sending messages game obvious information confused foreign coached team 
online coach standard coach language new concepts robocup domain need experiments evaluation
