ontology changes exists tight evolving ontologies semantic document annotation 
realistic application scenario incoming information annotated require annotating continuous adaptation new semantic terminology relationships 
heflin hendler heflin hendler elaborated great detail ontology may influence semantic annotations 
sketch example revision effects existing class definition refined maintainer semantic annotations may explore objects belong class

similar lines cases ontology revisions treated

recognition tasks provide mechanisms local setting document management system annotated documents metadata stored 
ontoannotate uses uri detect previously annotated documents highlights annotations old document user
