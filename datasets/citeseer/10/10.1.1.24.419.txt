customize query interface semantic knowledge retrieval 
develop additional reasoning services top knowledge model steps performed system authoring experts quality document relationship model depends crucially quality ontology says possible express 
authors focus usability reusability 
reusable ontology includes potential aspects arise considering aspects submitting new document document structure easily discourage system users 
usable ontology side includes highly relevant aspects easy understand 
ontology expressed ocml operational knowledge modeling language language rest steps 
constructing ontologies special web tool webonto 
fourth step construction model ontology document structure performed casual users distributed way 
submitting new document author uses environment enabling define relations documents aspects modeled world 
form environment called knote dynamically generated actual ontology 
fifth step querying database performed lois interface knowledge retrieval created automatically key classes knowledge model specified 
methodology summarized domains enriching news stories supporting scholarly debate knowledge management medical guidelines 
news server planet uses ontology events classes people organizations stories projects technologies 
addition enriching searching stories designed implemented intelligent agent 
gather data popular news item solicit potentially popular stories identifying gaps knowledge base 
enable personalized service finding new stories user profile 
digital library server enables ideas relation literature 
ontology consists contribution elements relationships divided argumentation non argumentation links 
ontology designed support scholars making claims asserting relationships concepts 
scholars may support raise issue refute claims 
document enrichment support organizational learning 
project enrich tries support discussions structured documents concepts learning 
fact learning efficient acquired knowledge immediately applied 
documents domain concepts incrementally enriched users supports group learning 
educational systems computer educational tutoring systems allow users take lesson time place teacher availability constraints 
traditional computer aided instruction tools provide just set static pages text better cases simulators usable specific purpose 
courses delivered systems adapted personalized usually teacher editor course 
tools teaching strategies encoded directly taught content user presses button go screen 
obvious practically impossible reuse knowledge encoded system 
necessary content knowledge separated system teaching strategies 
intelligent tutoring systems called knowledge tutors computer instructional systems separate data bases knowledge bases instructional content specifying teach teaching strategies specifying teach attempt inferences student mastery topics dynamically adapt instruction 
adaptation teaching materials particular student usually artificial intelligence techniques

systems usually built scratch date reusing knowledge parts tutoring systems 
today attempts overcome establishing common methodology frameworks enable knowledge reuse speed development systems development easier 
establish common ontologies best way order achieve goal 
advantages discussed

authoring tools enable store tutoring materials separate better reusable form 
editing network topic storing course content necessary define ontology network particular course area

ontologies common previously mentioned special ontologies top level ontologies derived 
survey follows ontologies fundamentally change way systems constructed 
today knowledge bases built little sharing reuse starts blank slate 
intelligent systems developers libraries ontologies 
building scratch assemble knowledge bases components drawn libraries 
greatly decrease development time improving robustness reliability resulting knowledge bases 
proposed new field knowledge engineering called ontology engineering 
field concerned theoretical practical aspects ontologies ontology development maintenance reuse discussed areas interest discipline 
ontology viewed possibilities topmost part knowledge base

ontologies help express commonly accepted conceptualization domains 
worlds domains described various ways languages conform ontology easily possible provide translation different descriptions 
ontology helps interlingua serves common language translations construct translators pair language translators language common interlingua provide translation 
facilitates sharing knowledge reuse knowledge various systems exactly internal representation world 
area tightly related knowledge sharing reuse communication multi agent systems 
agents communicate commonly agreed understood syntax semantic messages

ontology plays role conceptual dictionary

application needs explicit conceptualization sophisticated search document large database world wide web
