aodv aodv shares dsr demand characteristics discovers routes needed basis similar route discovery process :10.1.1.132.7416
aodv adopts different mechanism maintain routing information 
uses traditional routing tables entry destination

source routing aodv relies routing table entries propagate rrep back source subsequently route data packets destination 
aodv uses sequence numbers maintained destination determine freshness routing information prevent routing loops 
sequence numbers carried routing packets

route error propagation aodv visualized conceptually tree root node point failure sources failed link leaves 
specification aodv includes optimization technique control rreq flood route discovery process 
uses expanding ring search initially discover routes unknown destination

critique dsr aodv demand protocols share certain salient characteristics 
particular discover routes data packets lack route destination 
route discovery protocol query reply cycles route information stored intermediate nodes route form route table entries aodv route caches dsr 
important differences dynamics protocols may give rise significant performance differentials 
virtue source routing dsr access significantly greater amount routing information aodv 
example dsr single request reply cycle source learn routes intermediate node route addition intended destination 
intermediate node learn routes node route 
promiscuous listening data packet transmissions give dsr access significant amount routing information 
particular learn routes node source route data packet 
absence source routing promiscuous listening aodv gather limited amount routing information 
particular route learning limited source routing packets forwarded 
usually causes aodv rely route discovery flood may carry significant network overhead 
second route caching aggressively dsr replies requests reaching destination single request cycle 
source learns alternate routes destination useful case primary shortest route fails 
having access alternate routes saves route discovery floods performance bottleneck 
may possibility route reply flood 
aodv hand destination replies request arriving ignores rest 
routing table maintains entry destination 
third current specification dsr contain explicit mechanism expire stale routes cache prefer routes faced multiple choices 
noted stale routes may start polluting caches 
stale entries deleted route error packets 
promiscuous listening node mobility possible caches polluted stale entries removed error packets

routing table entry entry expired
