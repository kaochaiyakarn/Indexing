consequently question arises knowledge comes process knowledge acquisition supported building textual cbr system 
give overview main ideas textual cbr compare information retrieval techniques section

section briefly preliminary results obtained projects performed discuss related 
textual cbr versus information retrieval basic ideas information retrieval trying recall relevant textual documents problem situation technique traditionally applied information retrieval ir 
quite number successful ir systems exist market including search engines www 
systems characteristics nearly implement basic models vector space model encodes elements index vocabulary means large vector 
document represented vector th position represents weight th index term determined calculated frequencies term set documents similarity documents determined comparing vectors representing document calculating cosine measure 
alternatively inference network model documents represented certain nodes graph contains nodes index terms query terms nodes connected arcs weighted observed probabilities document collection 
ignoring differences models heavily rely assumptions 
index vocabulary determined document collection applying statistic heuristic techniques 
example terms occur considered useless terms occur seldom 

weight index terms counting frequencies document collection term frequency inverse document frequency measures 
consequently similarity documents frequencies 
terms knowledge container model mentioned section means fact document collection may contain meaningful knowledge index vocabulary similarity measure fixed document set 
principles allow application ir system virtually domain textual documents available number problems arise domain specific knowledge integrated ir system improve problem solving behavior 
sketched models support information considered represented non textual form additional structured information diagrams attempting specific domain knowledge struggle problems ambiguity problem sets keywords compared documents may highly similar actual meaning documents may differ significantly 
paraphrase problem natural language meaning may expressed completely different expressions 
textual cbr vs ir contrast textual cbr promising approach long application limited specific domain system built particular domain mind specific knowledge ir textual cbr representation documents sets index terms obtained statistic evaluations sets features established knowledge acquisition similarity measure term frequency weighting domain theory application new domains easy requires knowledge acquisition domain knowledge considered required non textual information integrated evaluation designed addressed sufficiently table comparison ir textual cbr may considered selection index vocabulary definition meaningful similarity measure ffl performing careful knowledge acquisition features important domain identified keywords terms expressions term dictionary constructed limited statistic evaluations 
features may cover single keyword example expression customer administration module represents certain functionality project applications 
ffl textual cbr system domain specific ambiguity problem avoided great extend 
ffl carefully analyzing domain consideration similarity measure constructed goes term frequency weighting considering domainspecific thesaurus ontologies domain point important recognize difference ir systems thesauri easier domain specific knowledge utilized 
terms describe objects specific application domain names devices processes normally occur general purpose thesauri available format 
table summarizes major properties paradigms 
obvious major advantage textual cbr ability domain specific expertise order go pure keyword matching improve problem solving behavior 
benefit free designed knowledge acquisition process required order encode existing knowledge available cbr system 
information environments dealt artificial intelligence approaches handling textual data novel requires additional effort 
sketched section particular knowledge containers indexing vocabulary similarity measure filled 
precisely knowledge acquisition ffl case format defined including features case obtained textual description ffl measure constructed measures similarity cases documents feature descriptions 
section show supported techniques ai areas 
knowledge acquisition textual cbr order obtain cases reason document collection required map texts case features find appropriate index vocabulary 
obviously step keywords specific domain allow rough estimation content documents 
wants obtain meaningful representation texts natural language processing nlp techniques promising candidates 
sophisticated vs shallow nlp techniques projects experimented couple nlp techniques obtain sophisticated representation textual documents 
unfortunately nlp techniques number shortcomings comes real world texts ffl computationally expensive performance systems larger text collections permit integration systems 
ffl small dictionaries worse robust unknown terms encountered 
shortcomings experienced sophisticated nlp limited situations documents form short notes remarks properly structured sentences correct grammar 
open problem representation text delivered sophisticated nlp system utilized determine semantic similarity documents 
comparison textual documents shifted comparison nlp tools deliver graphs parse trees case probably ease task 
paraphrase problem addressed 
consequently concentrated called shallow nlp techniques part speech tagging 
efficient robust 
attempt build highly structured representation texts merely tag word probable class noun verb additional information word stem 
shallow nlp defining index vocabulary reasons discussed decided apply part speech tagging documents analyze result process 
treetagger tool developed institute natural language processing ims stuttgart university see www ims uni stuttgart de tools html 
particular objective obtain lists relevant resp 
non relevant keywords stemming information 
precisely applied procedure 
nlp tool tag example document collection 

normalize texts document collection replacing particular words corresponding stems 

obtain index terms grouping words common stems 

automatically classify index terms documents useful resp 
useless heuristics mark term useless determiner auxiliary modal verb preposition 
mark term useful adverb adjective full verb noun contained dictionary nlp tool 
mark term potentially useful 

useful potentially useful terms determine document collection discard appear seldom interest twice 

investigate useful potentially useful terms manually particular terms dictionary determine special terms domain spelling errors step requires manual effort limited relatively small set terms 
domain customer support example manually investigate index term list entries manageable hours 
concerning procedure issues highly important 
index term selection performed solely basis statistics keyword counting semantic information 

index term classified usefulness assigned special tag indicating represents domain specific general purpose term 
doing development index vocabulary various domains incremental general purpose terms obtained analysis domain utilized effort domain 
shallow nlp information extraction major parts contents documents plain text structured information may included documents 
particular technical domains text contains expressions volt cpu 
obviously better representation kind information attribute value pairs obtained texts automatically 
applied techniques originate area information extraction cf 
overview 
precisely defined number triggers indicate piece text contain expression suitable attribute value representation 
example consider phrase cpu constructed volt 
obviously cpu volt considered features case containing sentence 
ir systems split strings handle separately 
obtain features physical units volt names cpu defined triggers 
additional information provided triggers constraints example voltage numerical value usually written front volt string 
trigger observed complex sentence analysis starts objective extract information associated trigger 
result information extraction process case contain index terms corresponding documents structured information form attribute value pairs 
shallow nlp similarity assessment obviously similarity documents indicate similarity contents documents 
paraphrase problem clear similar contents may expressed various ways 
consequently thesaurus relating synonymous terms highly useful 
tool available english texts wordnet www cogsci princeton edu wn provides information similar words antonyms solid linguistic ground 
unfortunately tool wordnet available german 
english course cover general purpose terms domain specific expressions related wordnet 
fortunately german texts words composed shorter words 
particular true nouns
