number challenging issues remain unresolved ace research area vii parallel experiments real computational agents 
chief need parallel experiments truly parallel comparisons meaningful lead robust insights 
major hurdle need ensure salient aspects experimental design perceived human participants captured initial conditions specified computational agents 
experience suggests hard achieve perceptions human participants regarding design purpose experiment differ systematically perceptions investigator 
major hurdle experiments run human participants generally kept short prevent boredom participants keep constraints investigators 
means shadow past strongly affecting experimental outcomes individual human participants ways understood controlled investigators 
example participants come experiment idiosyncratic preconceptions regarding reliability generosity strangers 
contrast experiments computational agents run generations diminish dependence initial conditions 
important question type horizon short run long run provides best approximation real world economic processes 
real world economic agents essentially move new economic situation having chance settle long run behavior 
agents participate repeatedly economic situations similarity able long run learned inherited behaviors deal effectively situations 
basic issue ace area viii building ace computational laboratories need construct computational laboratories cls permit rigorous study complex distributed multi agent systems controlled experimentation 
separate cl constructed application researchers strive general multi purpose platforms 
experimental findings effectively communicated researchers means descriptive statistics graphical visualizations information overload 
findings validated comparisons data obtained sources 
particularly important unresolved issue area viii need ensure findings ace experiments reflect fundamental aspects considered application problem simply peculiarities particular hardware software implement experiments 
clearly issue equally relevant alife researchers 
portable cross platform language java helps ensure independence hardware platform independence specific software implementation features 
address issue possible approach model docking alignment different computational models enable model application problem 
possible approach independently programmed versions computational model java version run cross program replication experiments different hardware platforms personal computer unix workstation 
cross platform replication require example encapsulation pseudo random number generators saving pseudo random number seed values programming practice case

general question addressed constitutes suitable scale analysis ace modeling

useful ace modeling addressing issues internet enabled experiments potentially lower organizational costs associated running experiments 
detailed contributing factor cost running human subject experiments participants typically receive monetary payments proportional experimentally determined net profit earnings ensure incentives mimic incentives face corresponding real world economic situations
