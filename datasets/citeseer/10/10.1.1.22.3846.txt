insertion dataspace datum independent existence explicitly withdrawn consumer 
setting interesting features play important role data shared large number clients entity producing information necessarily coincide user 
conjunction aspects leads unwanted ect accumulations outdated unwanted information 
useless information grow inde nitely compromising performance system 
possible solution consists leaving process responsibility take care data produces explicitely free resources longer needed 
rst drawback approach failure producer may cause resources data freed 
approach clashes basic principle generative communication independency datum process produced 
setting unusual lifetime datum longer lifetime producer making management datum producer impossible 
commonly adopted solution problem see jini leasing mechanism notion temporary data storing datum explicitely consumed lifetime datum decided producer 
time expired existence datum longer granted 
example temporary data consider newsgroup application dataspace hold posted messages 
posting message user may know period time message longer important 
example relevance conference call strongly decreases submission deadline may remain interest 
case user speci es time left submission deadline required duration message 
time expires message cancelled example provide space new messages 
study ects temporary data expressiveness shared dataspace coordination language 
start introducing traditional linda process calculus slight variation calculus permanent data data remain available dataspace explicitly consumed process 
moving temporary data intermediate step introduce simpler model ephemeral data data may disappear moment insertion space 
ephemeral data represent situation decision data remove completely left dataspace manager takes decision independently content data 
useful model data tha lost system crashes 
deal realistic model data equipped lifetime information 
output operation performed process speci es time datum required remain available dataspace 
speci ed time expired datum removed dataspace 
interesting aspect model related technique removal expired data 
consider approaches called local global removal respectively 
global approach expired data simultaneously removed 
corresponds invoked frees space occupied expired data 
hand local case expired datum disappears disregarding expired data 
case frees portion space occupied expired data amount space strictly needed store incoming data 
compare approaches described expressiveness viewpoint 
precisely investigate decidability properties existence terminating divergent computation ability provide encoding random access machine preserves properties 
regarding permanent data recall deterministic encoding rams proposed preserves existence terminating divergent computations 
calculus ephemeral data turns weaker model 
show possible decide existence divergent computation reduction decidable property place transition nets reset arcs 
contrary existence terminating computations remains undecidable possible provide nondeterministic encoding rams preserves existence terminating computations 
removal policy uences expressive power calculus temporary data 
local removal technique temporary data equivalent ephemeral data global removal increases expressive power 
fact global case provide nondeterministic encoding rams preserves existence divergent computations 
termination preserving encoding calculus ephemeral data works case 
termination divergence undecidable temporary data global removal wonder calculus global removal equivalent permanent data 
prove weaker showing impossibility providing deterministic encoding ram preserves divergence termination calculus global removal 
result achieved reducing divergence problem superclass deterministic processes processes computations nite nite divergence problem place transition nets reset arcs
