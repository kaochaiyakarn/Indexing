discussion clear important innovations human computer interaction benefited research corporate research labs universities funded government 
conventional style graphical user interfaces windows icons menus mouse phase standardization standard technology just making minute incremental changes 
important university corporate government supported research continue develop science technology needed user interfaces 
brief history hci important argument favor hci research universities computer science students need know user interface issues 
user interfaces main value added competitive advantages hardware basic software commodities 
students know user interfaces serve industry needs 
computer science hci research disseminate products 
furthermore appropriate levels funding academic hci research fewer phd graduates hci perform research corporate labs fewer top notch graduates area interested professors needed user interface courses offered 
computers get faster processing power devoted user interface 
interfaces gesture recognition speech recognition generation intelligent agents adaptive interfaces video technologies investigated research groups universities corporate labs 
imperative research continue supported
