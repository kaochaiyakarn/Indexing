operation planning imacs section describes techniques imacs uses generate evaluate operation plans 
subsection discusses steps 
step finding machining features part final component created executing set machining operations piece stock example shows design socket call shows stock produced 
annotations tolerance specifications tell variation nominal geometry allowable physical realization input imacs takes solid models tolerance specifications operation plan sequence machining operations capable creating workpiece intermediate object produced starting performing zero machining operations 
machining feature portion workpiece affected machining operation 
machining operations imacs currently considers milling side milling face milling drilling 
primary feature machining feature intersection stock large possible intersection space outside stock small possible 
shows examples primary non primary features detailed definition reader referred 
design socket stock created 
stock part primary short primary long primary example non primary primary drilling features part stock set primary features socket milling features drilling features 
described reason interested primary features operation plan interest considering machining operation create primary feature truncation primary feature 
primary features derive machining operation imacs want consider 
set primary features imacs generates automatically solid models algorithm described 
example primary features socket shown 
features overlap needed order create example need machine order create step generating feature model fbm irredundant subset features produced removing features example socket composed features fbm fs fbm fs described operation plan interest corresponds fbm sense machining operation create feature truncation feature fbm subset generated set covering techniques 
usually want generate 
part stock exponentially example primary features shown form socket general lead operation plans 
described imacs avoids enumerating doing depth branchand bound search shown generated time pruned appear unpromising 
example imacs generates socket step generating operation plans fbm lead operation plans better 
generate operation plans fbm imacs depth branch bound search 
search procedure incorporates steps ffl find precedence constraints 
due various types interactions accessibility setup features fbm features machined arbitrary order 
interactions introduce precedence constraints requiring features machined features 
example hole machined slot order achieve reasonable machining tolerances avoid tool breakage 
ffl generate total orderings 
precedence constraints contradict total ordering consistent consider 
imacs generates total orderings consistent precedence constraints 
ffl truncate features 
total ordering require different set modifications features machining operations spend lot time trying remove metal removed previous machining operations 
example features shown produced truncating corresponding features fbm 
ffl identify unpromising 
features truncated imacs discard fbm contains features dimensions tolerances appear unreasonable 
examples include hole drilling operation having large length diameter ratio boring operation having large ratio outer diameter inner diameter concentric hole drilling operations tight tolerance opposite approach directions 
ffl analyze 
imacs analysis detailed manner order discard unpromising elementary pruning assumption setup setup setup features machined ordering constraints setup setup setup process details feature feature tool diam feed number pass length name type mm mm min passes mm milling milling milling milling drilling drilling drilling drilling drilling drilling drilling milling milling operation plan derived fbm 
plan costly making socket table estimated production time operation plan 
operation time min operation time min drill mill drill mill drill mill drill mill drill mill drill mill drill setups total time minutes flat jaw vise available device 
currently developing sophisticated analysis techniques imacs described forthcoming 
ffl relax redundant constraints 
truncated features produced resulting may identical features different precedence constraints 
occurs precedence constraints differ removed translating total orders partial orders 
example shows partial order fbm 
ffl incorporate finishing operations 
faces tight surface finishes tolerances imacs adds finishing operations precedence constraints finishing operation comes corresponding operation 
currently finishing operation face allowed 
ffl determine setups 
axis vertical machining center features machined setup approach direction 
partial ordering constraints determine features machined setup shown 
ffl determine process details 
select cutting parameters machining operations imacs uses recommendations data center handbook 
maximum recommended cutting parameters attempting select optimal cutting parameters imacs estimates involve considerable approximation 
step operation plan evaluation designers give design tolerance specifications specify far design vary nominal geometry 
verify operation plan satisfy design tolerances imacs estimate tolerances operations achieve 
typical approaches computer aided tolerance charting computationally intensive consider limited types tolerances imacs evaluates aspects wide variety tolerances getting optimization aspects approach described 
example operation plan shown satisfies tolerances shown 
acceptable operation plan making total time machining operation consists components cutting time tool engaged machining non cutting time including tool change time setup time

machining features correspond machining operations create feature extraction thought finding subgoals achieve 
ai planners subgoals normally arise plan construction specified task decompositions occur preconditions planning operators 
set primary features imacs corresponds subgoals care consider imacs finds subgoals feature extraction step tries construct plan 
ffl alternative sets subgoals 
corresponds set possible subgoals occur planning fbm corresponds collection subgoals sufficient produce final goal 
principle possible combine features goal formula classical ai planners formula disjunct conjuncts form fbm taken represent conjunctive goal creating features exponential number representing goal formula explicitly require exponential time space worst case 
constructing formula explicitly imacs uses branch approach generate time pruning unpromising ones fully generated 
ffl resolving goal interactions 
feature fbm corresponds machining operation entire fbm corresponds partially ordered plan 
interactions features resolved creating precedence constraints imacs discards plan 
point adding additional operators plan operators just create redundant features 
ffl subgoal modification

truncating features corresponds modifying subgoals manner ultimate goal achieved usually occur traditional ai planners 
ffl finding optimal plans 
ai planning systems soon plan achieves goal imacs looks costly plan capable producing design 
imacs uses branch bound search continue generating evaluating plans evident remaining plans better best seen far 
order efficiently imacs prunes plan various cost computations evident plan unpromising

simplifies task resolving goal interactions manner 
fbm set subgoals achievement sufficient achieve goal contains goal interaction resolved introducing precedence constraints point introducing new operators plan 
promising plan exists achieving goal 
imacs resolve goal interactions fbm introducing precedence constraints discards fbm tries 
point approach useful producing operation plans machined parts manufacturing domains
