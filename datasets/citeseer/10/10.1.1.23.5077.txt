historically multilevel problems analysed moving attributes single level interest aggregation disaggregation 
aggregation means carrying analysis region level example means individual level attribute region place individual level data 
disaggregation means moving region level attribute values descriptors regions descriptors individual 
strategies create different sets problems 
groupings exist drivers country members family properties entities wish include modeling individual instances may independently identically distributed iid 
heterogeneity relationships hierarchical data held databases frequently statistical models full iid assumptions explain heterogeneity sufficiently 
fact independence assumption violated estimates standard errors conventional statistical tests small resulting deceptive statistically significant results 
lack independence observations groups expressed intra class correlation 
population estimate variance explained grouping structure 
states group information account total variation data 
aggregating higher group level information lost analysis begun 
disaggregation lead apparent statistically significant relationships reality questionable 
problems associated analysing data solely level drawing relationships level 
robinson robinson shows aggregate level relationships group means individual level attributes estimates corresponding individual level relationships 
known robinson effect ecological fallacy 
robinson showed drawing inferences higher level analysis lower level just misleading

multilevel models goldstein attempt realistically model situations clustering individuals groups attributes measured different grouping levels hierarchy 
models assumption independence individuals dropped relationships data longer assumed fixed groups allowed differ 
multilevel models number goals mind firstly determine direct relationships individual group level explanatory attributes age region type single measure attribute cost insurance claim 
secondly determine explanatory attributes group level regional country attributes serve moderators individual level relationships 
moderators exist show statistical interactions explanatory attributes different levels 
occur example varying regional road assessment score affected relationship yearly mileage claim cost individual level 
moderator interaction relationships allow explain variation cost insurance claims groups 
possible statistical techniques 
example stark difference individual level cost claims certain regions may possible explain difference multilevel model region level attributes region city county 
thirdly improve prediction cost claims individual units goldstein especially minority groupings pooling similar individuals different groups 
fourthly partition variance components levels group variation claim costs put differences drivers different regions group components variation due differences drivers region
