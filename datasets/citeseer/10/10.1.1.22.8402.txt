knowledge bases shows instance tab prot 
contain complex structures need viewed various levels abstraction different contexts truly understood 
underlying model knowledge base just interpretation knowledge modeled may reflect individual organization perception information space 
consequently knowledge acquisition cognitively challenging task user clear understanding ontology manage detailed information 
prot users expressed need tools provide visualizations coarser grained structures knowledge base provide mechanisms easily efficiently navigate information 
knowledge base tools including prot provide primitive restrictive visualization capabilities 
tend domain task specific views difficult customize scale large complex knowledge bases 
early visualization tool called semnet promising adopted general community 
semnet proprietary tool required time fairly advanced hardware produce interactive views 
problems reported prot users include disorientation navigate large complex ontologies 
unwieldy screen clutter occurs due separate window frames opened

shrimp views shrimp simple hierarchical multi perspective visualization technique designed enhance people browse explore model interact complex information spaces 
shrimp uses nested graph view information hierarchically structured 
introduces concept nested interchangeable views allow user explore multiple perspectives information different levels abstraction 
shrimp combines hypertext metaphor animated panning zooming motions nested graph provide continuous orientation contextual cues user 
features result environment user interact directly information space enhancing understanding information structures promoting exploration 
shrimp visualization technique originally designed enhance programmers understand programs 
context software visualization shrimp presents interactive nested graph view software architecture 
program source code documentation embedding marked text fragments nodes nested graph 
finer connections fragments represented network navigated hypertext link metaphor 
shrimp employs fully zoomable user interface exploring information 
interface supports zooming approaches geometric semantic fisheye zooming 
user browsing information space may combine approaches magnify nodes interest 
geometric zooming simplest type zooming 
part nested view simply scaled specific point view 
geometric zooming causes information hidden view 
fisheye zooming allows user zoom particular piece information preserving contextual information 
information interest appears larger information reduced size accordingly 
shrimp provides semantic zooming method 
magnified selected node display particular view javadoc classes visualizing java program shrimp 
source code package integrating shrimp prot shows alternatives displaying hierarchy 
view left shows kind tree view typically shown prot display class hierarchies 
view right nested view featured shrimp 
depending task hand 
example shrimp visualize java program zooming node representing java package cause node display children packages classes interfaces 
alternatively zooming action may reveal javadoc file exists 
possible views may include annotation information code editors graphical displays 
node representing class interface may display children attributes operations may display corresponding source code 
shrimp determines view show action initiated zoom action 
example user clicks link source code view shrimp zoom appropriate destination node display source code node 
shows shrimp interchangeable nested views allow different views java domain 
shrimp primarily software visualization date shrimp tool language independent browsing editing information space

instances represented nodes graph instance relationship represented nesting instance nodes corresponding class node 
instance nodes class nodes distinguished different colours 
slot dependencies classes instances knowledge base represented graph directed arcs nodes 
example instance slot value referring instance arc drawn instances 
template slots relating classes represented directed arcs classes

shows tab prot 
user navigate knowledge base tab ways 
user selects class instance leftmost columns shrimp view zooms animated zooming technique selected class instance node 
alternatively user interact directly shrimp view zooming nodes nested graph 
forms instance class nodes embedded directly inside node 
user interact forms edit fashion available prot 
addition user zoom bring focus class instance nodes double clicking slot values forms 
previously prot double clicking slot value form referring instance class open separate window containing class instance form 
actions invariably result complex displays 
shrimp view contains browser buttons go back forward search nodes 
features greatly assist navigation

knowledge acquisition section briefly discuss may useful tasks required ontology authoring knowledge acquisition 
consider provided visualizations may address typical concerns faced user adding new knowledge existing knowledge base 
knowledge base consists ontology set instances 
noy mcguinness developing knowledge base scratch includes steps define classes ontology identify main concepts ontology arrange classes subclass superclass hierarchy define slots properties classes define allowable values slots define restrictions slots add instances fill values slots instances extending maintaining existing knowledge base may involve additional steps browse understand existing class hierarchy ontology browse understand instances slot values restrictions knowledge base restructure ontology instances blythe identified typical concerns users may adding new knowledge intelligent system 
concerns follows user know start go users know adding right things users get lost takes steps add new knowledge consider tasks concerns perspective user maintaining wine food knowledge base 
fig 
leftmost column view indicates class hierarchy quite complex 
difficult get impression width depth class hierarchy traditional prot tree view 
furthermore difficult ascertain multiple inheritance class hierarchy 
shrimp view snapshot attempts provide additional insight class hierarchy 
user filtered temporarily hidden instance nodes slot dependencies classes 
furthermore nesting subclasses superclasses user decided directed arcs reflect subclass relationship nesting nodes optional 
user issues tree layout algorithm class nodes subclass arcs 
resulting view provides user snapshot view width depth hierarchy revealing levels deep multiple inheritance class hierarchy 
view right shows class nodes nesting instance nodes slot relationships instances turned filtered 
snapshot gives quick approximate overview number instances knowledge base reflects general nature slot dependencies instances 
user brush move mouse individual arcs see slot types dominate dependencies instances 
mouse moves arc small tooltip window briefly displays name slot 
user brushes node name node shown tooltip

final section discusses application shrimp knowledge acquisition describes steps research 
discussion described integration shrimp visualization tool prot tool 
shrimp primarily software visualization 
section explore techniques software visualization applicable general knowledge domains 
software engineering subset knowledge engineering clearly similarities differences 
similarities include software engineers shown different authoring comprehension strategies writing maintaining software 
case knowledge engineers authoring maintaining ontologies 
domains visualizations customizable extensible user 
applications visualizations available need task benefit visualization realized support particular task evolution software knowledge base 
substantial user feedback required test proposed visualizations provide support set identified tasks 
domains face substantial challenges respect scale complexity information modeled 
mechanisms filter information required applications 
navigation management multiple views bridging different levels abstraction likewise needed domains 
despite similarities differences mentioned metadata instance data typically visually separated software visualization tools 
software schema hidden user implicit information 
shrimp ability distinguish ontology instances currently inadequate 
includes extending shrimp address shortcoming 
ontologies explored shrimp complex typical schemas software tools 
sophisticated visualization mechanisms required 
explore parts lifecycle knowledge base benefit techniques 
beneficial knowledge engineers trying understand unfamiliar knowledge base helpful knowledge engineer modeling new knowledge base 
visualizations provided shrimp help detect inconsistent ambiguous features knowledge base
