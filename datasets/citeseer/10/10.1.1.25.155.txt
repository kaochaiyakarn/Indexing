national statistical institutes need merge administrative files variety sources unique identifiers available facilitate matching 
agencies need connect data sources different countries sources verify confidentiality microdata 
merging administrative lists agencies need fast software cleaning standardizing lists merging lists 
bureau census software name standardization address standardization matching considered state art 
standardization software breaks names addresses components easily compared 
matching software accounts typographical error automatically estimates matching parameters optimizes sets assignments large groups pairs records 
keywords matching standardization organizations need identify duplicates large databases 
population register individual entities persons enterprises may listed registry numbers 
identify duplicates name address date birth information may needed 
names uniquely identify address date birth information needed 
names addresses date births contain typographical errors identification duplicates difficult 
duplicates arise variety situations 
duplicates arise large database updated external source registry numbers available error 
duplicates happen databases combined order obtain varying data economic demographic analyses 
record linkage methodology bringing corresponding records files finding duplicates files 
term record linkage originated public health area 
refers records files individual patients brought linked name date birth information 
years advances yielded computer systems incorporate sophisticated ideas computer science statistics operations research 
ideas modern record linkage originated howard newcombe newcombe see introduced odds ratios frequencies decision rules delineating matches nonmatches 
newcombe ideas implemented software epidemiological applications 
newcombe methods rely frequencies computed priori large national health files 
fellegi sunter provided formal mathematical foundations record linkage 
theory demonstrated optimality decision rules newcombe introduced variety ways estimating crucial matching probabilities parameters directly files matched

cleaning standardizing files matching dependent identifiers having errors inconsistencies 
matching uses names addresses difficult put comparable formats 
types matching name full date birth 
types variables income cost housing size business number employees 
different matching metrics needed comparing different types fields surname family name house number year birth age income 
record linkage deal lack unique identifiers matching fields errors identifiers

matching methodology product space files match pair represents business entity pair represents different entities 
single list duplicate record represents business entity record list 
regard pairs may necessary consider pairs agree certain identifiers blocking criteria 
blocking criteria called pockets sort keys 
instance making detailed comparisons pairs lists records representing businesses state may sufficient consider set pairs agree postal zip code 
missed matches false nonmatches agree set blocking criteria 
record linkage decision rule rule designates pair link possible link 
possible links pairs identifying information sufficient determine pair match 
typically clerks review possible links decide match status 
record linkage software uses formal mathematical model fellegi sunter 
decision rules fellegi sunter model optimal sense fixed upper bounds rate false matches false nonmatches decision rules minimize size clerical review region 
accurate matching crucial get accurate estimates agreement probabilities individual fields agree field match agree field 
situations involving files individuals em algorithm estimate agreement probabilities winkler yield reasonably optimal decision rules 
due higher rates varying representations names addresses em algorithm yield reasonably estimates files businesses 
matching decision rules estimated agreement probabilities obtain likelihood ratio score matching weight 
situations matching weights obtained adding specific agreement weights associated individual fields 
illustrates real matching situation true matching status known 
left curve having lower matching weights associated nonmatches 
right curve having higher matching weights associated matches 
region lower cutoff upper cutoff clerical review

situations including situation method belin rubin automatically estimate false match rates 
alternative methods estimating error rates described winkler larsen rubin 
table illustrates pairs brought matching process 
true matches having severe typographical variations name address typically get low matching weight 
types variations occur frequently lists enterprises lists individuals

software deal general situations occurred repeatedly 
individuals need recognize patterns data 
record linkage straightforward learn easy look sets pairs decreasing matching weight 
unusual situations occur special steps may needed 
pairs matched may low matching weight 
low matching weight due name address standardization failure extra pre processing files may needed
