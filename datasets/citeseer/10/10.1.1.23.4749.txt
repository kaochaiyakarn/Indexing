grouping strategy section grouping strategy aims finding planar patterns related planar homologies 
strategy consists principal steps step detecting repetitions look patches repeat image small neighbourhoods interest remain invariant changing viewpoint illumination 
step detecting regularity matches neighbourhoods repeated patterns input cascaded hough transform yields fixed structure candidates particular candidate lines fixed points vertices pencils fixed lines 
step finding groupings having identified fixed structure candidates hypothesize homology test validity finding extent area image mapped similar area homology 
step combining groupings valid groupings single image analyze find interrelation obtain deeper insight scene structure 
sections describe steps somewhat detail mainly refer earlier 

finding repetitions regions interest searched image 
purpose affinely invariant neighbourhoods proposed tuytelaars 
invariant changing viewpoint affine transformations change shape image order cover identical physical parts surfaces 
fact affine transformations considered point may contradict aim dealing perspective distortions 
restriction acceptable practice neighbourhoods small 
nonlocal steps deal full perspective effects 
different types neighbourhoods combination 
patches corners organized local extrema intensity 
variety different neighbourhood types ensures sufficient number neighbourhoods get grouping process started 
features general lines line intersections fixed sized patches schaffalitzky zisserman 
kinds features specific image predefined user 
neighbourhoods come feature vectors invariant affine geometric changes scalings offsets different colour bands 
precisely feature vector consists geometric photometric moment invariants 
invariant description find similar repeated neighbourhoods image 
add neighbourhood types cover patches constant colour 
case moment invariants characterization 
simply colour ratios case sensitive changes intensity 
situation feature space space colour ratios 
matching repeating neighbourhoods neighbourhoods brought correspondence relative affine deformation scaling offset colour bands affine deformation local linear approximation actual homology 
avoid combinatorics stage exploiting invariant feature vectors 
allows apply combinatorics free detection repetitions 
type invariant neighbourhood different feature space constructed 
neighbourhoods cover repeating patterns similar feature vectors similarity quantified mahalanobis distance 
analysis starts locations feature space high density 
clusters correspond neighbourhoods repeated times image typically periodic structures 
having removed high density clusters look pairwise neighbourhood correspondences typical mirror symmetries hashing technique selecting pairs neighbourhoods predefined mahalanobis distance 
pairwise matches clusters far matching candidates 
validate checking normalized cross correlation compensating affine skew 
step limited small number candidates amount combinatorics involved limited 
finding regularities mentioned earlier assume regular repetition image pattern characterized planar homology 
corresponding projectivity leaves line fixed points pencil fixed lines unaffected 
hypothesize extract fixed structure candidates

finding fixed structure candidates cascaded hough transform candidate lines fixed points pencils fixed lines detected cascaded hough transform cht 
cht iterated application hough transform straight lines parameterized ax brings projective duality points lines explicitly perfect symmetry image coordinates line coordinates 
cht maps pair edge point coordinates line parameter space 
similarly point coordinates hough space corresponds line space image

center points invariant neighbourhoods belonging cluster input level cht 
collinear arrangements detected way 
second application cht peaks output yields intersections straight neighbourhood alignments candidate vertices pencils fixed lines 
final third hough applied peaks output second yields collinear line intersections candidate lines fixed points 
pairwise matches low density areas feature space joins connecting centers matching neighbourhoods direct input second hough 
adding lines helps detecting pencils fixed lines cases limited number repetitions mirror symmetries 
adding lines pair neighbourhood centers run counter aim avoiding combinatorial steps 
measure restricted neighbourhoods near feature space belong low density parts feature space 
ensures relatively lines constructed 
similarly add intersections corresponding lines pairwise neighbourhood matches low density parts feature space directly second hough space third hough intersections corresponding sides parallelogram shaped neighbourhoods 
helps detecting lines fixed points
