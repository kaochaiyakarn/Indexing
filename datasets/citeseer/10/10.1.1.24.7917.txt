accidental recordings part courts damage done social implications far outweigh legal ones circumstances 
helpful kind announcement system radio traffic announcement system car interrupt playing cd tape important traffic announcement comes 
analogies robots txt file world wide web servers allows web robots check house rules excessively traversing site known emergency frequencies radio communications reserved constantly monitored emergency communications 
examples common notion wellknown mechanism known location publication information 
clients interested particular information need spend time energy searching readily access information available know known location publishing 
depending type device different announcement mechanisms need 
constant radio broadcasts example rapidly drain battery small mobile devices perfectly acceptable rooms buildings announce information 
rfid tags passively announce data collection batteries 
restricted storage size labels enhanced outsourcing information publicly available web site linking merely placing uri label 
format announcement similar initiative internet privacy covered lot ground area platform privacy preferences project short developed world wide web consortium working group representatives industry privacy advocate groups universities 
allows web sites describe data collection practices machine readable way read displayed enabled browser software 
users configure browsers accept reject certain types policies reject privacy policy uses home address marketing purposes automate nowadays tedious process judging acceptability sites practices 
obviously power consumption connectivity problems field ubiquitous computing difficult directly reuse results internet research projects 
main merit lies carefully crafted privacy policy vocabulary xml encoding format dozen elements allow web sites accurately describe data collect purpose doing recipients data retention dispute mechanisms place order deal customer complaints 
difficulties coming consensus vocabulary acceptable privacy advocates industrial marketers alike probably accounts years project taken 
currently final phase number web sites software developers begun incorporating protocol systems 
declaration format announcing known mechanisms form bottom line privacy aware ubiquitous system 
depending actual setup system single announcement cover multitude devices 
example office building announcement devices installed inside enters front doors 
rooms building repeatedly main declaration sensors devices room equipped 
wearable system hand represented single declaration owner cell phone 
single autonomous devices operated independently central services require announcement capabilities 
example coffee cup sophisticated memo function need able announce data collection practices absence central unit holder wear long cup collect data central unit 
single device need identified announcement 
goal exhaustively enumerate types data collected individual devices doing 
really matter sensors record audio data certain room fact audio recording done important information 
possible actual data collection perfectly legal 
office building collectively declare audio recording done room sensors equipped 
owner device system decide best interest 
course certain practices legal countries place severe restrictions surveillance video recording see limitation section 
choice consent enactment eu directive refined extended known fair information practices anymore simply announce declare data collection requires collectors receive explicit consent data subject 
directive effectively prohibits collection usage personal information certain legal procedures law enforcement public health explicitly individual 
common form explicit consent nowadays written contract 
showing signature data subject corresponding piece text collectors cases effectively demonstrate received explicit consent subject 
world electronic transactions explicit consent easy come 
digital signatures public key cryptography established concept actual usage signatures infancy 
far public key infrastructure pki achieved widespread usage actual verification signatures revocation difficult 
question authenticity digital signatures hard requirement explicitness certain statement may signed secret key certain individual individual knowledge signing particular statement personal software agent handled task background user knowledge 
electronic commerce explicit consent achieved requiring press button initiate data transfer 
ubiquitous computing setting press button physically impossible devices support tactile interface unusable hundreds devices multitude collectors constantly querying information walk busy street pressing ok button cell phone time want authorize transfer surely annoy patient person 
overlooked problem notion consent poses system design requirement choices option available getting consent comes dangerously close 
imagine order enter public building agree completely unacceptable practices 
certainly walk away deal really 
argue different supermarkets today feature comprehensive video surveillance system 
legal systems surveillance possible restrictive guidelines place restrictions purpose retention video feeds 
order consent viable option take leave dualism offered 
office buildings offer track position building order offer customized navigational services 
choose decline possible selectively disable tracking functionality shutting system visitors entering building 
advancements audio video processing choices available selective recordings requiring participants meeting consent comprehensive audio video recording system track agree recording voices muted picture videos anonymized 
simple solution similar lines classroom project georgia tech classroom recordings focus teacher replies voices faces students deliberately low quality 
anonymity pseudonymity difficulties asserting explicit consent electronic communications viable alternative personal data collection notions anonymity pseudonymity 
important option offering clients number choices wish remain anonymous remain allow legal collection certain types data requiring user consent 
anonymity defined state identifiable set subjects 
larger set subjects stronger anonymity 
large number free commercial anonymity services widespread world wide web 
anonymizing proxies example popular www anonymizer com sophisticated mixes freedom software product canadian software zero knowledge internet users today hide ip address web site hosting accessed page 
technology services established methods feasible ubiquitous computing environment 
communications small ubiquitous devices happen dynamic environment long chains communication mixes long devices constantly enter leave scene 
direct communications hand disclose real identity wireless protocols adapted time addresses fixed hardware mac address done bluetooth standard 
sensing hardware different network cards real world appearance cyberspace disguised easily video camera get clear shot pointed face 
anonymity disadvantages application point view 
anonymous prevents application requires authentication offers form personalization 
pseudonymity alternative allows fine grained control anonymity circumstances assigning certain id certain individual person repeatedly identified changes different id pseudonym allows holder personalize service establish reputation offering possibility step role wishes 
anonymous pseudonymous data traced back individual unlinkable collection usage data poses threat individuals privacy 
consequently legal frameworks eu directive lay restriction collection anonymous pseudonymous data 
determining certain type information linked back person subject debate 
example randomly generated pseudonyms linkable certain circumstances case pseudonym conjunction certain fact easy identify sufficiently small set linking trivial 
active badge programmed change id minutes fact tracking system able exactly pinpoint location change obvious linkable logs 
data mining technology allows remote coincidences assembled single coherent picture greatly increasing potential type information linking 
german privacy argued placing severe restrictions data mining applications call realistic 
proximity locality observations regarding feasibility certain desirable aspects privacy aware ubiquitous system clear notices explicit consent unlinkable pseudonymity prove difficult efficient reliable implementation 
possibility face technological reality preserving desirable state protection means form sociological adjustment principles proximity locality 
idea proximity basically practical solution notice consent hard 
announcing data collection care get required consent handle frequent cases various people give consent imagine society legal system accept fact personal coffee smart clothing record conversations behaviors owner 
just people forget thing witnessed 
note mean people suddenly omniscient memory prosthesis coffee gift indefinite recollection currently legal systems treat recording explicit consent parties surveillance allowed law enforcement certain court ordered situations 
case owner accidentally leave device witness conversation meeting people absence sensory equipment turned owner presence detected 
detection mechanism simple 
course advanced sensors check cup owner holding 
presence certain ids clothing owner trigger certain predefined signal emitted owner wearable computer sensors operational 
problem simplified cup data storage outsourced holder wearable computer case sufficient simply check presence type outsourcing facility effect acting collection device anybody holding cup sitting 
alleviate number technical problems recording conversation behavior just chatting friends suddenly memory 
storage allows friends playing information people unknown effectively witness events part 
comfortable idea friends having recollection past discussions certainly comfortable friends playing recordings group strangers entertainment value 
similar lines idea proximity aims notion locality 
working complicated authentication protocols govern distribution collected information compliance recipient information previously announced information simply tied places collected 
table room ground floor allowed ask hallway outside contact light fixtures staircase information soda machine rd floor currently acquiring 
printer tell everybody walking printing moment pass information people meet subway airport data ends side world 
essence require information disseminated indefinitely larger geographic boundary buildings rooms 
information collected building stay building network 
anybody interested information need physically order query 
additional authentication required anymore printer hallway happy tell anybody passing stopping chat documents printed night 
concept resembles privacy protection lack small rural communities everybody knows happy tell 
leaves boundaries village access information inhabitants difficult impossible 
word mouth allows information travel far originating locality information value drastically decreases increasing distance 
scenario observing larger distance impractical 
impossible acquire certain information ultimately requires physical locality source 
wouldn far current status quo law enforcement private investigators routinely interview witnesses version events coffee tables talk 

adequate security surprisingly talking privacy leads security considerations 
discussions significance perceived higher 
idea tempting solve security able achieve authenticity trusted communications privacy product follows inevitably secure environment 
secure communications storage methods quite time security experts constantly refining algorithms keep rapid technological development 
ubiquitous devices introduce new set constraints mainly areas power consumption communication protocols energy power embedded processor say felt pen compute product bit prime numbers 
pair smart shoes probably pass store front seconds barely time go orderly security protocol establishing secure communication 
ghz desktop power security experts question absolute security achieved 
true bit public key encryption probably secure foreseeable 
order prevent misuse keys need encrypted pass phrase invites usual problem choosing nicknames family members friends writing keyboard 
smartcards ultimate personal security device need protected unauthorized fall wrong hands 
biometrics allow fingerprints retinas replace personal passwords key distribution management tens hundreds small miniature personal devices socks door knobs certainly challenge clever user interface 
reduce complexity employing robust security situations highly sensitive data transfer financial transactions transfer medical information 
cases principle proportionality applies cracking bit key feasible proper hardware cracking code mean reward hardly worth effort 
similarly sending temperature data sensor base station need encrypted 
eavesdropper close overhear low power radio communication place sense current temperature 
principle locality relevant start broadcasting innocuous information temperature noise levels certain local context hops physically distant separated places effectively create surveillance devices 
data sent locally transmitted lack encryption concern simplifying implementations reasonable level compromise 
important aspect realize security panacea appears need panacea 
consequently apply principles proximity locality proportionality basic infrastructure function explicit security model adequately respecting privacy needs users 
access recourse trusting system especially system far reaching ubiquitous requires set regulations separate acceptable unacceptable behavior reasonable mechanism detecting violations enforcing penalties set forth rules 
topics belong realm legal practice laws codes conduct need revised newly established order address special requirements typical ubiquitous computing environments 
technology help implementing specific legal requirements limitation access repudiation 
augmenting protocol digital signatures allow non repudiation mechanisms parties prove certain communication took place case dispute 
database technology provide data collectors privacy aware storage technology keep data associated usage practices single unit simplifying process collected data full compliance declared privacy practices 
sophisticated xml linking technology enable data subject direct access recorded information order enable required access rights 
principles collection limitation set forth fair information practices simplify access requirements 
essence require data collectors collect data defined purpose advance storage collect data relevant purpose keep data long necessary purpose anonymization principles save time effort spent order properly collect protect manage large amounts sensitive personal information 
summary outlook lies intersection privacy protection ubiquitous computing easy imagine vision nightmare come true countless smart devices detailed sensing far reaching communication capabilities observe single moment lives unobtrusive invisible won notice 
ron rivest calls reversal defaults private public hard copy trivial duplicate easily forgotten stored forever 
clearly needs done nearly ubiquitous computing points little far accomplished 
principles mentioned readily implementable proper protocols limiting number communication hops message travel enforces locality creating simple proximity behavior personal devices prevents unwanted surveillance devising communication protocols temporary random ids provide base line anonymity 
implementing guidelines require amount finding adequate security settings scenario widely different requirements certain parts system deriving low power transparency protocols expressive compact creating simple mechanism pseudonymity identity management 
achieved porting existing solutions low power environment need re engineered scratch 
large research effort probably required fulfill needed trust requirements implementing digital signatures corresponding public key infrastructure back systems databases access technologies 
important take existing laws codes practices account serve important guidelines creating privacy respecting infrastructures equally important remember laws social technological reality 
certain legal requirements simply enforceable technological procedural solutions need law changed 
time face new technological realities accept fact personal data collection continue advance privacy know today 
new paradigms take place old unrealistic assumptions new forms human interactions evolve society just learned live modern photography warren brandeis years ago
