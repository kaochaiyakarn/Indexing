committee useful deciding classification fixed unknown distribution useful drifting distribution 
algorithm works follows 
committee composed maximum hypotheses hypothesis decision tree 
arbitrary instance committee member decision tree derived training instance seen 
sequence instances committee member voting weight performance record correct correct correct incorrect correct correct 
instances seen joining apple banana

seen committee member denoted committee members introduced different times trained different number preceding instances depending appeared 
example say current instance committee member appeared decision tree representing trained contains instance course computational cost retraining committee member time new instance arrives 
incremental algorithms exist inducing decision trees algorithm operate incrementally training decision tree committee single new instance time new instance arrives 
id example incremental decision tree induction algorithm utgoff committee initially empty 
instances arrive form 
new instance arrives committee maximum hypotheses single new committee member added 
new member started training instances containing current instance 
instance single committee member joins committee trained new committee member joins committee trained trained committee reaches maximum size new members longer added member forced retire 
test committee members member allowed vote testing instances derived distribution target concept current instance

mature committee members clearly rule correct hypothesis 
suddenly fortunate young customer graduates college career cs teaching assistant

respected members get incorrect
