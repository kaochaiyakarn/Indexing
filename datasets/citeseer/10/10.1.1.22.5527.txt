background chinese room important part scientific background today embodied cognition general adaptive cognitive epigenetic robotics particular searle chinese room argument cra 
critique predominantly ai research time searle distinguished positions weak cautious ai sees computer powerful tool study mind position agreed strong ai hold appropriately programmed computer really mind sense computers right programs literally said understand cognitive states 
searle famous cra position strong ai goes approximately suppose knowing chinese locked room 
door passed chinese writing 
room instructions english allow manipulate return chinese symbols purely syntactic fashion 
crucial question understand chinese sense know symbols mean 
obvious answer searle argued 
chinese speaking observers outside room consider symbols sent room questions assuming english instructions returned symbols correct answers 
searle point outside room considered understand obviously everybody knows goes inside room realizes just manipulating uninterpreted formal symbols 
furthermore searle concluded inside room simply instantiation computer program computer purely formally defined program said understand processes understand chinese 
reason lack understanding computer case searle elaborated due fact causal connections internal symbols external world supposed represent purely computational ai systems lack intentionality 
words capacity relate internal processes representations external world 
searle argued main reason failure strong traditional ai concerned computer programs tell machines searle physical systems situated causally connected environments 
fact accused ai dualism belief disembodied body computer programs intelligent 
ai research focusing purely formally defined computer programs working physical machines equipped causal powers living brains organisms including perception action learning 
fact approximately modern ai particular adaptive cognitive epigenetic robotics

physically embodied systems perceive act learn artificial means interaction environment situated argued develop observer independent representations intentionality

different notions embodiment noted previous section somewhat surprisingly discussions notions embodied cognition pay relatively little attention nature role body involved 
wilson sixth view line cognition explicitly mentions body playing central role

worth pointing groups closely related notions single defined positions 

embodiment structural coupling probably broadest notion embodiment systems embodied structurally coupled environment 
note necessarily require body 
franklin example argued software systems body usual physical sense intelligent 
embodied situated sense autonomous agents structurally coupled environment 
concept structural coupling originates maturana varela biology cognition discussed detail section 
inspired concept quick dautenhahn attempted provide precise definition embodiment system embodied environment channels exist 
see quick 

means embodied time exist subset possible states respect capacity perturb state subset possible states respect capacity perturb state 
argued definition quick dautenhahn referred minimal limited cognitive science due fact particularly restrictive 
press example argued attempt clarify notion embodiment important step time insufficient characterization due fact system sense structurally coupled environment 
means definition embodiment distinction cognitive non cognitive systems illustrated quick dautenhahn example antarctic 
persistently perturbed wind turn perturbs air currents flow 
embodied system definition certainly cognitive scientists consider example embodied cognition 

historical embodiment researchers emphasized cognitive systems structurally coupled environment embodiment fact result reflection history interaction 
varela 
example argued depends world inseparable bodies language social history short embodiment 
ziemke pointed natural embodiment living systems reflects embodies history structural coupling mutual specification agent environment course body constructed 
similarly press includes agent adaptation environment definition embodiment system embodied gained competence environment developed

particularly restrictive includes quick dautenhahn 
worth pointing historical embodiment physical embodiment considered special cases structural coupling notions includes excludes

section exclude domains physical domain particular programs may embodied result self organization explicit design 
similarly living systems examples physically embodied systems historically embodied physical systems 
somewhat restrictive version notion physical embodiment view embodied systems connected environment just physical forces sensors motors

worth pointing living artificial considered physically embodied necessarily historically embodied cf

robot reduced amount internal processing required respond selectively certain sound frequencies 
note case bodies cricket wheeled robot fact different crucial detail distance ears 
prominent complex example artificial embodiment humanoid robots famous cog brooks stein brooks argument research ai cognitive robotics order able address investigate human level cognition deal human artefacts 
dreyfus example pointed important ways neural nets differ embodied brains

odds net able generalize overwhelming 
argument closely related wilson sixth view embodied cognition cf 
previous section example aforementioned lakoff johnson bodily metaphorical basis concepts 
lakoff summarized basic idea follows meaningful conceptual structures arise sources structured nature bodily social experience innate capacity project certain structured aspects bodily interactional experience conceptual structures 
example concept grasping idea grounded bodily experience activity grasping physical objects robot gripper arm hand hardly expected able understand concept 
similar argument questioned suitability wheeled robots study behavior cognition organisms completely different means locomotion 
humanoid embodiment considered special case embodiment particular interest cognitive science

maturana varela distinguished organization system structure 
organization similar von notion building plan denotes relations exist components system member specific class maturana varela 
living systems characterized autopoietic organization 
autopoietic system special type homeostatic machine fundamental variable maintained constant organization regular homeostatic machines typically maintain single variables temperature pressure 
system structure hand denotes components relations constitute particular unity organization real maturana varela

organization constituted relations components define unity particular kind

maturana varela living systems machines humans cars robots 
autopoietic machine organization machine terms concatenation processes 
processes processes production components specify machine unity 
components produced processes independent organization machine
