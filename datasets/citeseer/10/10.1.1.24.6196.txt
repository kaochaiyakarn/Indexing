simply put mail place live habitat stated shown whittaker sidner place poorly supports tasks need accomplish 
note mail overloaded usage uses email go far imagined years ago interfaces mail clients kept pace 
ways mail victim success 
previous email literature researchers studying mail quite time 
early social organizational aspects mail summed sproull kiesler

research people mail clients includes studies current studies prototype interfaces 
noted previous section denning note current mail clients little help people received lots mail 
denning proposed solutions problem principles special path people get urgent certified personal messages second paths filtered

years whittaker sidner bellotti published study examined mail usage organizations 
previous studies mail variety tasks 
fact people mail tasks called mail just killer application serial killer writing seriously overloaded opted manage variety tasks originally meant support methodology previous studies mail portray clear trend mail number tasks meant support 
sought existing literature field study determine main activities people need mail clients support 
accomplish goal studied employees methods interviews analysis message archives survey 
structured interviews interviewed individuals part study 
participants included systems engineer television studio engineer encyclopedia editor sales representative administrative assistant game tester project managers training coordinators 
interviews scheduled hour participant office occur period absence computer thing morning meeting new messages waiting 
addition participants asked refrain reading new messages day prior interview 
part interview conducted contextual inquiry manner participants worked mail thinking aloud rest interview conducted traditional manner experimenters asking variety questions participants checked mail folder hierarchies handled message liked disliked mail 
message archives tool collect message archives second part study 
archives collected interview participants technical difficulties prevented collecting archives interviewees archives members authors workgroup 
tool collected information users mail archive including thread structure messages folder hierarchy messages filed messages sent information wasn collected subject lines bodies messages 
survey mail method study web survey 
interview findings developed survey asking variety questions message important unimportant people handle messages arrive people mail task planning tool people file messages people retrieve older messages 
survey sent approximately people general interest discussion lists resulting completed surveys 
majority questions answered point likert scale strongly disagree strongly agree 
participants important note software study participants arguably average comes technical expertise 
time careful include wide variety job roles excluded involved design development mail client 
participants microsoft outlook mail client standard 
mail activities review literature data collection developed conceptual model users activities surrounding email 
identified different activities flow people working tasks want keep flow incoming messages arrive 
triage people away mail period time need catch deal mail accumulated away 
task management people mail remind need help get tasks done 
archive people store mail refer 
retrieve archiving messages people need method retrieving messages 
activities discussed literature attention paid 
remainder section discuss activities depth ways interfaces better support activities 
flow activity stated mail habitat live 
live mail time 
eventually people computers keep track incoming messages arrive activity call keeping flow desire aware message arrival clearly indicated survey responses 
median response statement computer message arrives immediately look agree avg sd 
activities discuss flow activity typically secondary background activity unrelated primary task performed writing document reading web page 
users receive new message series tasks triggered factor mean reply message sole recipient manager line high importance flag project member direct report management chain peer interesting auto preview interesting subject line fewer family member cc line friend important dl line administrator fewer person org important dl cc line unknown sender table factors message importance 
mean responses survey questions form message particularly important revolving evaluating message deciding action take 
unfortunately flow task requires energy 
currently outlook provides methods notified new mail playing sound displaying icon windows task bar briefly changing mouse pointer 
users notified new message re doing switch outlook read message order determine need 
finished remember doing switch back 
context switching painful 
fact interview participants said stressed deeply involved task ignore outlook new message arrived turn new mail notifications shut outlook altogether 
support people involved flow activity need mail clients information decide need re doing deal message just came 
outlook mail notifications don support activity ways information notification help decide arriving email important notification priority importance message notification regardless message notification sensitive email device physical context notification enable ui quick common commands delete open reply decision shown notification 
fortunately solving problem simple displaying just little information new messages users aren forced switch away re doing don need 
microsoft messenger service new hotmail messages similar feature doesn exist outlook 
interestingly prototype unrelated project provided feature outlook distributed data indicated single feature popular features relatively minor part prototype 
course creating mail notifications question information display notification 
hotmail notifications display sender subject line table shows people may benefit seeing additional information decide deal message 
involved approach intelligent agent infer time message important user 
agents information decide incoming mail warrants interruption 
triage activity people spend blocks time going mail deciding messages 
time process unread messages messages read saved action 
call activity triage 
triage triggered events 
nearly survey respondents indicated performed triage activity inbox away form mail 
median response get morning thing check inbox strongly agree avg sd 
median response get back meeting thing check inbox avg sd 
triage may triggered full inbox median avg sd arrival important message median avg sd 
note performing triage single message soon arrives essentially flow activity discussed previous section 
interviews observed dominant strategies approaching triage activity serial interviewed participants prioritized 
participants serial strategy read messages order arrival prioritized strategy skipped picking interesting senders subject lines sorting group messages sender 
dominance prioritized strategy supported survey median response lot mail read skip find important messages avg sd 
believe reasons underlie prioritize strategy 
people greater need keep aware things important potential greater impact life 
second people may able finish triage task attend task people want deal important messages 
key ui challenge triage activity supporting intelligent prioritized browsing pending messages 
includes providing information flexibility ui people identify messages consider important support dealing collections related messages threads effectively greater support reading action threads 
discuss prototype threading messages section 
task management clear people rely heavily mail clients help keep track need 
mackay whittaker sidner bellotti study 
interview participants mail messages lists survey median response keep messages reminders action owe response agree avg sd 
people kept messages needed read median avg sd messages respondent owed reply median avg sd 
problem observed single successful method provided outlook handling tasks 
outlook provides separate task list tool interview participants feature 
furthermore survey asked message needs action right away move outlook task list 
median response disagree avg sd 
addition task list outlook provides low level methods handling messages need action leave inbox mark unread flag follow move specific project folder move calendar 
shown far popular strategy keeping inbox 
strategy prevalent interviews observed thing bellotti people placing non email related tasks inbox sending mail 
course problem keeping inbox inbox quickly swamped messages making difficult needs done 
asked easily tell messages kept reminders median response neutral avg sd 
whittaker sidner problem suggestions improving interface better support activity task management grouping messages thread allowing people flag messages system remind message 
outlook supports suggestion doesn appear widely mean response leave inbox mark unread flag followup list move project folder asked message needs action right away flag follow feature median response disagree avg sd

clearly information content message important median response try keep message easy find may want information contains agree avg sd people tend file messages objects may files file pointers web links 
fact second popular reason keeping message attachments move task list post notes move calendar scrap computer list move general action items folder users task management strategies 
average likert scale ratings various mechanisms turning message task reminder 
may contain 
reported similar findings noting email main method exchanging documents 
explained popularity exchanging documents mail ability message provide context attachment ability attachments elaborate enrich text mail 
attachments unfortunately attachments pose problem today mail clients 
mail systems outlook keep data central server size quotas enforced 
mailbox quotas mb limit reached quickly attachments sent received 
users delete message delete attachment save attachment file system deleting message 
cases users lose exact synergy bellotti emphasize users really value 
ideally solve simply invoking massive increase hard disk capacities year people delete managed client server systems today remains complex problem solve cleanly 
involved solution create mail systems allow users store attachments separately mail maintain links message file file message 
folders common way today mail clients facilitate archiving messages folders 
previous research examined users folder structures 
people archives studied average number folders folders min max 
folders organized hierarchy typical depth levels 
data indicate complexity folder structures increased whittaker sidner study average folders spring cleaners folders frequent folders 
numbers higher numbers reported mackay average number folders 
clearly having folders lead problems including folders having messages useful mail clients enforcing alphabetical ordering folders isn users want having folders longer useful having folders filing requires scrolling long list folders 
fortunately users don problem finding place messages go 
survey asked filing message know exactly go median response agree avg sd 
just people know file message doesn mean message belongs just mean response contents attachment file path folder 
problem programs outlook allow messages stored folder 
problem acute dealing entire threads messages 
analysis message archives message threads spread folders outlook habit automatically placing replies sent items folder guarantees stored separate folder parent message 
aside note outlook allow users associate multiple category labels messages way limitation able store mail folder 
ui attach retrieve messages categories cumbersome median response categories feature outlook disagree avg sd 
rules filtering rules filters methods assisting users activity archiving mail 
methods existed quite provided mail clients today including outlook 
rules popular survey respondents respondents reporting rules filter incoming mail sender discussion list 
fact respondents rules filing discussion list 
unfortunately rule filing common interacts poorly email task management 
task related messages automatically filed away users looked explicitly go check pending tasks people things sight mind clich reported 
solution allow messages exist locations inbox folder project specific folder discussed previous section solution isn provided mail clients 
url mail address reasons filing 
mean responses survey questions form try keep message easy find may want addressees system provides functionality described 
mail filing filing takes time today systems allow messages stored place 
system developed researchers compaq src labs called introduces system solves problems 
notion folders form separate storage buckets messages reside single conceptual store 
users create folders standing queries search commands continuously updated 
creating folder mail project create standing query messages sent distribution list messages containing word subject body 
users collections standing queries represented just folder hierarchy advantages filing required messages exist results standing queries 
similar issues explored document management space dourish 
retrieve activity people archive messages want able recover clearly main activity people need mail clients retrieve older messages 
just archiving messages retrieval common activity asked question access old messages median response strongly disagree 
clearly archiving strategy affects retrieving strategy 
formed folder hierarchy don problems filing mail correct folder survey data previous section indicated retrieving messages easy 
asked need access old message look folders created median response agree 
furthermore people didn problems knowing folder look 
asked need access old message know folder filed message median response agree 
surprising aspect data extent people look messages sent items folder 
asked need access old message look sent items folder median response agree 
consistent strategy interview participant deleted messages soon responded 
figured message important look responded copy sent items folder 
participant admitted felt comfortable strategy group extremely keeping copies important mail ask old message couldn find 
note strategy mean response day week month year older age retrieved items 
mean responses survey questions form frequently need access messages old depending exist archives important documents 
interesting finding survey respect retrieval age messages tended retrieved 
shows survey respondents believed message got older chances needing retrieve message declined 
implication messages screen inbox visual scan suffices search needed 
testing threaded mail client points section noted grouping messages part reply chain help alleviate pain experienced users mail 
section discuss early prototype interface developed facilitate threads results lab study tested interface 
threads help believe providing threaded mail client potential help users main ways 
displaying message replies chain provides better local context help users better understand conversations occur mail 
context somewhat preserved current email programs automatically include text previous messages replies method breaks multiple people reply message creating complex branching reply tree 
second making main unit display thread items displayed time providing greater global context 
noted previous sections users strategies depend messages view inbox 
collecting messages threads sets messages normally displayed lines displayed just line allowing people view items 
third users primarily threads individual messages interface provide valuable global operations 
currently receive messages thread mail browser 
messages replies grouped item displayed left 
clicking items displays messages inside thread right 
messages displayed line preview format right clicking message displays entire message 
left right panes thread tree displayed help user determine structure thread messages relate 
part thread perform sets mouse keyboard actions messages read file delete 
messages grouped perform set mouse keyboard actions 
may small benefit multiplied large number email messages benefit translates significant saving 
analysis user mail archives sd messages occur threads messages may underestimate people delete messages parts threads 
addition higher level operations possible 
instance start receiving messages topic re really interested unsubscribe thread current messages deleted messages topic 
example wanted add conversation having forward person current messages trying find message summary thread subscribe person thread receive past messages 
prototype interface explore benefits threaded mail client built early prototype visual basic 
wanted prototype support just activities discussed section chose triage activity wanted see threaded mail client help people process large amount unread messages 
prototype shown 
prototype panes left pane shows list threads clicking thread displays right pane 
thread list left pane sorted message thread visually grouped day 
entry thread list shows number attributes thread thumbnail thread tree sender subject time message line sender subject unread message 
thread list thread tree thumbnail appears left thread contains messages 
compact visual representation gives users high level sense structure thread parts haven read user 
right pane consists header list messages 
header shows sender message thread sent messages received messages thread title original thread message date message thread 
message list sorted message date oldest newest grouped day 
entry message list shows icon indicating read unread status sender subject different previous words body time 
selected message expanded inline showing sender subject addressees cc addresses complete body 
just left list parallel depiction messages thread tree users see individual messages relate 
design decision note departure messages signify replies 
usenet browsers display messages thread indented tree 
tree display couple flaws deep trees typical shape email conversations result substantial wasting valuable display space newest messages distributed randomly list messages writing mail uncommon refer prior message limited ancestors tree 
tree display destroys temporal order making complete message context difficult reader understand 
chose sort message list right pane date avoiding problems 
addition allows grouping day helping give sense temporal characteristics conversation 
testing prototype test thread interface recruited sixteen participants mail job months received messages typical day 
participants told journalist just returned vacation 
job go mail messages accumulated enter tasks spreadsheet email messages generated experimenters 
participants minutes complete task 
half participants randomly assigned thread interface half interface threading turned left pane interface shown just showed list messages clicking message displayed right pane 
post test questionnaire participants responded number questions point likert scale strongly disagree strongly agree 
question didn email program read messages median response subjects message prototype avg sd median response thread prototype avg sd 
analysis mann whitney test difference significant thread prototype preferred 
users threaded interface commented threads helped perform task better 
participant wrote messages referring idea grouped 
easy read refer back participant wrote easily see resolved spent time concluding remarks identified major activities surrounding people email 
particular highlighted activities keeping flow incoming messages existing messages believe important haven widely covered previous studies 
activity discussed mismatch user expectations current interfaces support problems changed past decade possible solution directions 
quite amazing majority problems remained unchanged unaddressed main new problem dealing attachments 
early prototype thread mail client results lab study evaluation
