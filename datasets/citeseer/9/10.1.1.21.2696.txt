proximal nodes model permits operation fact node belongs final result determined identity text position nodes operands proximal explained 
shows schema possible set operations 
basic extraction operators forming basis querying structure contents operators combine results classified number groups operate considering included elements including elements nearby elements manipulating sets direct structural relationships 
explain detail relevant case single hierarchy includes xml model 
ffl matching sublanguage accesses text content database orthogonal rest language 
matches matching language generates set disjoint segments introduced model belonging special text hierarchy 
text answers generate flat lists 
example computer generates flat set segments letters word appears text 
note matching language allow complex expressions regular expressions 
operations matches applicable subsets text hierarchy transformations segments 
see point previous mechanism generating match queries restrict language sublanguage 
example collapse sets matches merging overlap results 
including elements free positional content basis expr 
match matches basis structure constructor view included elements matches direct structural parent set manipulation composition operations child collapse subtract 
distances possible operations model classified type 
ffl basic structure operators kind leaves query syntax tree refer basic structural components 
name structural component struct queries 
set nodes type 
example chapter retrieves chapters book 
name hierarchy hierarchy queries 
set nodes hierarchy 
effect obtained summing operator node types hierarchy 
ffl included operators select elements operand sense included second 
free inclusion select included element 
set nodes included node example citation table selects citations inside table 
positional inclusion select elements included position 
order define position top level included elements including node considered 
qualifying nodes descend node position left right considered order linearize position node top level nodes disjoint node considered overlap discarded descendants 
language expressing positions values independent 
consider finite unions gamma gammaj gammaj suffice purposes 
range possible values 
example paragraph page retrieves rd th th paragraphs pages 
paragraphs included paragraphs top level ones considered partially included page discarded 
ffl including operators select operand elements including sense elements second 
set nodes include nodes assume 
example section computer selects sections word computer appears times 
ffl direct structure operators select elements operand direct structural criteria direct structure tree corresponding hierarchy 
child set nodes children hierarchy node position considered th children 
assume 
example title child chapter retrieves titles chapters titles sections inside chapters 
parent set nodes parents hierarchy nodes assume 
example chapter parent section selects chapters top level sections 
ffl distance operators select operand elements distance element second operand certain additional conditions 
set nodes segments segment candidate node nearest node considered distance includes select including 
order node considered candidate node minimal node containing exist cases 
example table chapter retrieves nearest tables figures inside chapter 
set nodes segments segment distance text symbols nearest ones 
plays role 
example computer architecture paragraph selects words computer followed architecture distance symbols inside paragraph 
recall distance measured filtered file markup removed 
ffl set manipulation operators manipulate operands sets implementing union difference intersection different criteria 
union example small medium large set size changing commands 
union text segments collapse 
gamma set difference example chapter gamma chapter chapters figures 
subtract text segments resort operations matches 
intersection example section chapter section page selects sections top level sections chapter time third top level section page 
intersect text segments 
set nodes segments segment node example title gets titles say exactly 
clearly inclusion determined text area covered node fact element qualifies depends elements include included 
direct determined identity nodes appropriate information hierarchical relations nodes 
note just information text areas covered discern direct general inclusion 
distance operations carried just considering areas covered examining nearby elements operands 
set manipulation needs identity nodes depend nearby nodes operands 
proximal nodes model suggests implementation index built structure text separated normal index text content 
structural index basically hierarchy tree pointers know parent child sibling node 
addition implicit lists different structural element maintained traverse complete tree subtree nodes type 
query time node query syntax tree converted intermediate result leaves root evaluation orders considered explain clarity 
intermediate results trees subsets hierarchy 
leaves structural elements solved structure index directly correspond pure queries content solved classical index content inverted file translated list text segments match query 
list particular case tree answers 
internal query nodes correspond operations carried operands solved trees nodes 
defined model allowed operations solved synchronized linear traversal operands total time solve query proportional total size intermediate results 
implementing xql operations path expressions sight xql query language looks different query language 
typical xql expressions form chapter section paragraph represents direct inclusion 
expression translated directly proximal nodes query paragraph child section child chapter lowest level elements selected 
despite look navigational operation enter chapters move sections paragraphs regard search operation nodes certain type certain ancestors 
operation basic xql immediately alternative models query structured text positional information query direct 
transitive inclusion expressed double bar translated operation proximal nodes 
navigational looking feature xql ability express absolute paths paths evaluated root structure tree 
simulated adding extra single root node hierarchy adding child queries 
wild cards structural names permitted xql write book section mean sections directly descending descends directly book 
wild card replaced proximal nodes feature permits node name result hierarchy 
xql permits queries type meaning third contained corresponds exactly positional inclusion feature proximal nodes existing model 
models extended arbitrary ranges values indices relative included element 
filters possible express wants top level bottom level nodes 
done filters chapter section paragraph selects chapters contain paragraph contained section 
easily translated chapter paragraph child section similarly express book author john silver condition author element descends book 
translated positional inclusion 
xql permits boolean operations inside filters requires care 
selects elements contain element converted 
hand requires contains converted 
selects elements containing element rewritten gamma proximal nodes permits negated variants containment operations 
xql extension permits say inside condition 
maintains normal semantics requires extra care 
example book author bob requires author field inside book equal bob 
directly expressed proximal nodes converted double negation gamma 
attributes widely feature xql attributes nodes 
deviate significantly simplifying models 
structural node number attributes name value possible restrict matches having attribute attribute property 
example book publisher addison gamma wesley selects books attribute publisher addison wesley 
lot attention attributes 
key observation attribute appears text inside text region node clearly identified name 
hard indexer identify treat just descendant node 
distinguishing feature attributes restriction attribute internal structure 
previous query translated book publisher addison gamma wesley addison wesley content query return text segments string appears publisher return text areas correspond publisher attributes 
intersection yields precisely desired result 
note treated attribute normal field 
sense proximal nodes model general xql need distinctions 
example xql treats different operation query structural elements text value equal constant proximal nodes exactly query just considered 
somewhat special feature permitted xql permit constants content absolute paths 
example book author attribute descends directly root 
contemplated proximal nodes model easily fixed query processing phase detecting cases getting text directly file replacing text constant 
key issue done absolute paths just value 
generalized feature called semijoin supported xql proximal nodes 
semijoin allow selecting chapters title mentioned bibliography section book 
note violates condition proximal nodes model fact book qualifies determined considering text areas titles books needs compare content titles bibliography book 
hard implement efficiently 
methods xql designed embedded perl imports perl functions 
course general expected supported model proximal nodes 
methods supported 
text corresponds textual content node basic method proximal nodes 
second value similar text casted types integer float 
permits putting say numerical conditions content attribute 
despite solved text index proximal nodes model coexist independent context indexes different index able answer questions built numerical values text gracefully coexist rest system 
index receive condition say return text areas containing numbers smaller 
proximal nodes permits conditions aggregate functions selecting elements including directly transitively elements kind 
set operations xql permits set operations directly translated proximal nodes operations 
interesting mention xql requires answer set structural nodes satisfy query 
matches proximal nodes semantics models return top level bottom level elements 
followed despite standard xql permit implementations allow kind followed operation 
unfortunately description clear coincidence 
shown cm semantics followed operation problematic models 
proximal nodes carefully designed element preceding element selected 
possible operate result know say smallest containing followed selected followed loose information selected guarantee smallest contains selected contain corresponding proximal nodes model tries fix problem permitting moment executing operation specify force smallest contains contain totally solve problem 
alternative solution return supernode necessary extension contain node fake fit hierarchy yields consistency problems operations 
models able handle ccb rely strict hierarchy nodes permit overlapping 
models example cope direct inclusion 
shown cm quite difficult find satisfactory consistent definition followed operation hierarchical model
