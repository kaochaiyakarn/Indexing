output set information extraction rules 
extraction process involves examining possible text fragment appropriate size see matches rules 
foil growing rule srv means hill climbing space possible literals step adding literal matches positive examples possible excluding large number previously covered negative examples 
rule deemed covers positive examples specialization judged unproductive positive examples matching removed training set process repeated 
particular domain positive example labeled text fragment sequence tokens training documents negative example unlabeled token sequence having size positive example 
training assess goodness literal negative examples 
representation rule learner attempts express salient characteristics positive examples mainly terms individual tokens contained surrounding 
srv input set features defined individual tokens 
features come varieties simple features map tokens arbitrary discrete typically boolean values relational features map tokens tokens document 
example simple feature capitalized 
example relational feature token token returns token immediately
