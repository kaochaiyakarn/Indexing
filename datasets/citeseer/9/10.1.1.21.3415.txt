framework draws techniques information filtering web searching citation indexing identifies natural scope portion object complete object collection objects behavior observed 
process observations basis identifying information may interest specific users addressed briefly alternative system architectures proposed 
concludes identifying open issues significant implications utility information content models observable behavior 

searchers faced classic problem finding needle haystack haystack growing rapidly continual demand improved search technology 
fundamental approach search changed 
model information needs user typically query profile 
model content information objects counting terms 
technique boolean matching vector space similarity 
match model need models available content 
cases relevance feedback automatic profile learning base model need part model content 
improved models information content directly improve type search cases leveraged improve model user information needs 
examine broad class information content models observation user behavior 
goal provide framework integrates previously seen diverse set techniques coherent basis design 
information systems represent information content object basis feedback provided users object referred recommender systems cacm 
consider observations user behavior form implicit feedback framework propose fits perspective 
recommender systems associated information filtering term describe called push services designed find new information pre specified topics 
representations course called pull services users seek retrieve information existing collections 
information filtering systems classified forms content collaborative oard 
recommender systems typically contrasted called content systems information content represented basis terms contain 
categories mutually exclusive 
focus exclusively representing document content observable behavior

information filtering research example common assemble set training instances hand labeled relevant relevant 
numerous studies shown explicit feedback clearly useful yan garcia molina goldberg 
similar results routinely obtained relevance feedback techniques depend explicit feedback information retrieval experiments 
practice system developers frustrated find users operational systems little relevance feedback mechanisms 
probably results part time effort required provide explicit feedback additional cognitive load may result need decide explicit rating document 
experience suggests explicit feedback unwise 
section review emerging literature implicit feedback context information filtering 
section introduce framework representing information content observable behavior situating research implicit feedback broader context 
section preliminary thoughts information content representations effectively large scale systems 
section concludes comments research directions suggested framework introduced 

implicit feedback lessons information filtering implicit feedback may bear indirect relationship user assessment usefulness individual document 
collected ubiquitously potentially great quantities potential impact implicit feedback ultimately greater explicit feedback 
system filtering internet discussion groups usenet utilized implicit explicit feedback modeling users stevens 
sources implicit evidence message read ignored saved deleted follow message posted 
summarizing study stevens observed implicit feedback effective tracking long term interests operates constantly intrusive 
morita introduced source proposing information filtering technique observations reading time 
conducted user study week period users determine preference usenet messages reflected time spent reading messages 
results showed strong positive correlation reading time explicit feedback provided users 
discovered treating messages user read seconds relevant produced better recall precision information filtering simulation achieved messages explicitly rated user relevant

repeated study natural setting distributing modified software allowed volunteers participate recommender system trial explicit feedback reading time recorded small set usenet discussion groups 
results indicated recommendations reading time nearly accurate recommendations explicit feedback 
suggested additional observable behaviors including printing forwarding replying privately message sources implicit ratings

observing behavior scale complete object provide precise evidence user intentions object scale observations cost somewhat complex data collection effort 
retain category groups behaviors suggest degree intention object

retention category distinguished possibility directly observing evidence negative evaluations 
retention default condition electronic mail systems decision user delete object support inference deleted object valued objects retained 
information access priced item basis purchase decisions offer extremely strong evidence value ascribed object 
similar information available somewhat coarser scope users purchase subscription access certain types content subscription separately priced cable television channel 
retention behavior occur narrower scope 
users print entire documents cost printing provide incentive print important parts longer documents 
somewhat artificial place printing single category framework 
grouped printing retention permanence printed page 
users print documents merely facilitate examination advantages electronic displays 
printing examine retain annotate segment object class minimum scope overlaps category users print document intention forwarding individual printed document object poster 
printing associated desire retention find grouping useful

modeling information content nature appropriate representation information content intimately related way user information need represented available techniques matching

collaborative filtering systems initial user needs profile typically constructed manually selecting set predefined stereotypes 
behavior users respect information objects observed observations predict value information objects users 
shows simple strategies accomplishing inference followed prediction prediction followed inference 
inference prediction strategy inference stage seeks produce ratings similar user explicitly assigned prediction stage uses estimated ratings predict desirability object user 
konstan 
adopted perspective evaluating observed reading time predicted explicit ratings individual articles 
prediction inference strategy contrast uses observations behavior users predict behavior user inference stage seeks estimate value information predicted behavior 
stevens implemented variant strategy predicting examination duration new usenet news article examination durations similar articles past constructed content queries select articles long predicted examination durations 
equates degenerate inference stage desirability assumed increase monotonically examination duration 

alternative strategies making recommendations collaborative filtering systems second strategy flexible participating users draw different inferences observations share common set objectives
