information retrieval ir relationship query document determined primarily number frequency terms common 
unfortunately words morphological variants recognized term matching algorithms additional text processing

stemming conflation algorithms created ir systems reduce variants root form 
linguistics groups xerox developed number linguistic tools english information retrieval

popular algorithms information retrieval lovins stemmer porter stemmer suffix removal 
lovins finds longest match large list endings porter uses iterative algorithm smaller number suffixes context sensitive recoding rules 
krovetz accurately describes problems associated methods 
stemmers operate lexicon ignore word meaning leads number stemming errors 
words different meanings conflated stem words similar meaning conflated 
example porter stemmer conflates general generous generation generic root related pairs recognize recognition conflated 
addition stems produced suffix removal algorithms words difficult purpose information retrieval 
interactive techniques require user input term selection query expansion suffer greatly user stems real words 
difficult perform dictionary look real words 
entries dictionary stemmed correspondance word stems word definitions 
dictionary look important feature ir applications 
example multilingual information retrieval query may subject automatic translation case system able find query term transfer dictionary 
problems cited section easily overcome approach stemming uses morphological analysis 
xerox lexical technology morphology branch linguistics studies describes words formed language includes inflection derivation compounding 
inflection characterizes changes word form accompany case gender number tense person mood voice 
derivational analysis reduces surface forms base form derived includes changes part speech 
xerox linguists developed lexical database english languages analyze generate inflectional derivational morphology 
inflectional database reduces surface word form dictionary follows ffl nouns singular ex 
children child ffl verbs infinitive ex 
understood understand ffl adjectives positive form ex 
best ffl pronoun nominative ex 
derivational database reduces surface forms stems related original form semantics 
example government stems govern department reduced depart forms different meanings 
stems valid english terms irregular forms handled correctly 
derivational process uses suffix prefix removal conventional stemming algorithms rely solely suffix removal 
sample suffixes prefixes removed ffl suffixes ly ness ion ize ant ent ic ic ical able ance ary ate ce dom ee eer ence ency ery ess ful hood ible ify ing ish ism ist istic ity ive ment ory ous ty ship ure ffl prefixes anti bi contra counter de di dis en extra inter intra micro mid mini multi non para poly post pre pro re semi sub super supra sur trans tri ultra un databases constructed finite state transducers promotes efficient storage access 
technology allows conflation process act reverse generating conceivable surface forms single base form 
database starts lexicon base forms generate roughly half surface forms
