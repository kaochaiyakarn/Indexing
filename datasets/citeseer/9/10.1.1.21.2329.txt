dependencies class values terms follow certain probabilistic distribution 
specifically adopt naive bayesian model 
class associated multinomial term variable take values probability denotes term total number different terms 
document class modeled collection values duplicates allowed associated variable generates successively 
document class length number occurrences value delta delta delta probability randomly chosen document delta delta delta pi value estimated intuitive value see justification 
class taxonomy internal node ith child document classifier node classifies delta delta delta choosing maximizes probability belonging belongs sigma probability document belongs estimated stated estimated fraction number documents belongs class documents contain large number terms perform feature selection reduce cost 
addition separate terms noise feature terms increase accuracy classifier features may cause overfitting loss generality
