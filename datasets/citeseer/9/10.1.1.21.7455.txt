ieee multimedia meet conditions don correspond persons interest 
perfect method extract faces persons interest image sequence analysis 
extracting names persons interest requires depth semantic analysis transcript 
studies reported message understanding conference achieved sufficient accuracy selecting names text 
selecting names persons interest proved harder problem 
extract faces names correspond persons interest 
system employs face detection tracking extract face sequences natural language processing techniques dictionary thesaurus parser locate names transcripts 
extracted faces names name associates correspond 
transcripts don necessarily give explanations videos straightforward method exists associating faces videos names transcripts 
observing typical news video composition assume corresponding face name coincide may associated pair 
potential difficulties exist associating faces names lack necessary faces names possible multiple correspondences faces names 
example system successfully extracts person interest face topic find correct name coincides face 
example multiple correspondence assume topic clinton senator robert topic clinton house speaker newt 
system decide clinton face shown topic corresponds name clinton clinton face shown topic corresponds name clinton compensate drawback name gives priority face name pair coincides frequently outputs pair associated face name pair 
obviously face similarity required evaluate face name association example match faces topic topic 
system regards faces identical infer face coincides topics name clinton 
evaluating face similarity may resolve problem lack faces names 
face doesn coincide correct name expect faces identical face topics coincide correct name 
system employs video recognition obtain face name association
