background denial service attacks consume resources remote host network serving legitimate users 
principal classes attacks logic attacks flooding attacks 
attacks class ping death exploit existing software flaws cause remote servers crash substantially degrade performance 
attacks prevented upgrading faulty software filtering particular packet sequences remain serious ongoing threat 
second class flooding attacks overwhelm victim cpu memory network resources sending large numbers spurious requests 
typically simple way distinguish requests bad extremely difficult defend flooding attacks 
purposes study focus solely flooding attacks 
attack types related consequences flooding attack network load induced impact victim cpu 
load network attacker generally sends small packets rapidly possible network devices routers nics limited bandwidth packet processing rate 
second usually best measure network load attack 
attacker simultaneously attempts load victim cpu requiring additional processing required receive packet 
example best known denial service attack syn flood consists stream tcp syn packets directed listening tcp port victim 
syn packet received host victim search existing connections match allocate new data structure connection 
number data structures may limited victim operating system 
consequently additional protection small syn flood overwhelm remote host 
similar attacks exploit code vulnerabilities including tcp ack nul rst data floods ip fragment floods icmp echo request floods dns request floods forth 
distributed attacks single host cause significant damage sending packets maximum rate attackers packet sent response victim tcp syn open port tcp syn ack tcp syn closed port tcp rst ack tcp ack tcp rst ack tcp data tcp rst ack tcp rst response tcp null tcp rst ack icmp echo request icmp echo reply icmp ts request icmp ts reply udp pkt open port protocol dependent udp pkt closed port icmp port unreach 
table sample victim responses typical attacks 
mount powerful attacks leveraging resources multiple hosts 
typically attacker compromises set internet hosts manual semiautomated methods installs small attack daemon producing group zombie hosts 
daemon typically contains code sourcing variety attacks basic communications infrastructure allow remote control 
variants basic architecture attacker focus coordinated attack thousands zombies single site 
ip spoofing conceal location effective response attackers typically forge spoof ip source address packet send 
consequently packets appear victim arriving third parties 
spoofing reflect attack innocent third party 
address reflector attacks describe fully section 
basic methodology noted previous section attackers commonly spoof source ip address field conceal location attacking host 
key observation technique direct denial service attacks programs select source addresses random packet sent 
programs include popular distributed attacking tools shaft tfn tfn variants trinity spoofed packet arrives victim victim usually sends believes appropriate response faked ip address shown table 
occasionally intermediate network device router load balancer firewall may issue reply attack icmp message 
illustration backscatter action 
attacker sends series syn packets victim series random spoofed source addresses named receiving packets victim responds sending syn acks spoofed hosts 
icmp messages sent randomly spoofed source address 
attacker source address selected random victim responses equi probably distributed entire internet address space inadvertent effect call backscatter behavior illustrated 
backscatter analysis assuming packet random source addresses reliable delivery response generated packet attack probability host internet receiving unsolicited response victim attack packets 
similarly monitors distinct ip addresses expectation observing attack nm observing large address range effectively sample denial service activity internet 
contained samples identity victim information kind attack timestamp estimate attack duration 
assumptions average arrival rate unsolicited responses directed monitored address range estimate actual rate originate term 
borrowed vern paxson independently discovered backscatter effect attack accidentally disrupted multicast connectivity selecting global multicast addresses source addresses 
attack directed victim follows measured average inter arrival rate backscatter victim extrapolated attack rate packets second 
address uniformity estimation approach outlined depends spoofed source addresses uniformly distributed entire ip address space 
check sample observed addresses uniform monitored address range compute anderson test statistic determine observations consistent uniform distribution 
particular implementation test specified rfc significance level 
analysis limitations assumptions underly analysis address uniformity attackers spoof source addresses random 
reliable delivery attack traffic delivered reliably victim backscatter delivered reliably monitor 
backscatter hypothesis unsolicited packets observed monitor represent backscatter 
discuss potential biases arise assumptions 
key assumptions random selection source address 
reasons assumption may valid 
isps employ ingress filtering routers drop packets source ip addresses outside range customer network 
attacker source address range may include monitored addresses underestimate total number attacks 
reflector attacks pose second problem source address uniformity 
situation attacker attack sending packet spoofed victim source address third party 
third party responds sending response back victim 
packets third addressed broadcast address popular smurf attacks third parties may amplify attack 
key issue reflector attacks source address specifically selected 
ip address range monitor reflector unable observe attack 
detected instances monitored host involved sort attack 
inability detect reflector attacks cause underestimate total number denial service attacks 
distribution source addresses random attempt extrapolate attack rate arrival rate responses produce arbitrarily biased result 
particular problem mitigated verifying distribution observed source addresses uniform set addresses observe 
limitation arises assumption packets delivered reliably packet generates response 
large attack packets attacker may queued dropped 
packets arrive may filtered firewall intrusion detection software forms attack traffic tcp rst messages typically elicit response 
responses may queued dropped path back monitored address range 
particular estimate attack rate necessarily limited capacity smallest bottleneck link victim monitor 
random distribution assumption limitations cause underestimate number attacks attack rate 
may bias characterization victims large commerce sites software educational sites may disproportionately underestimate size attacks class victim 
final limitation technique assume unsolicited responses represent backscatter attack 
server internet free send unsolicited packets monitored addresses packets may misinterpreted backscatter attack 
possible eliminate accidental errors choosing quiescent address range monitoring filtering packet flows consistently destined single host range high pass filtering record sufficiently long voluminous packet flows 
concerted effort third party bias results difficult detect correct automatically 
source bias arises misinterpretation random port scans backscatter 
impossible eliminate possibility general show extremely factor vast majority attacks observe 
spite limitations believe approach sound provides worst conservative estimate current denial service activity 
attack classification collecting large trace backscatter packets task post processing trace 
group collections related packets clusters representing attacks 
choice specific aggregation methodology presents significant challenges 
example unclear contemporaneous backscatter indicating tcp icmp attacks classified single attack multiple attacks 
difficult problem determining start times attack 
presence significant variability lenient threshold bias analysis fewer attacks longer duration low average packet rates strict interpretation suggests large number short attacks highly variable rates 
knowledge intent attacker direct observation attack orchestrated attacker impossible create synthetic classification system group types attacks appropriately metrics 
chosen employ distinct classification methods flow analysis classifying individual attacks long kind event method analyzing severity attacks short time scales 
flow classification purpose study define flow series consecutive packets sharing target ip address ip protocol 
explored approaches defining flow lifetimes settled fixed timeout approach packet seen target creates new flow additional packets target counted belonging flow packets received minutes packet flow 
choice parameters influence final results conservative timeout tend suggest fewer longer attacks shorter timeout suggest large number short attacks 
chose minutes human sensible balance unduly affected punctuated attacks temporary outages 
reduce noise traffic generated due random internet misconfiguration instance netbios implementation configuration sends small numbers unsolicited packets monitored address range discard flows packets flow duration seconds 
parameters somewhat arbitrary believe represent reasonable baseline thresholds attack cause significant damage

related denial service long recognized problem limited research topic 
existing roughly categorized focused tolerance diagnosis localization 
category composed approaches mitigating impact specific attacks general system mechanisms controlling resource usage victim machine :10.1.1.41.1733

techniques generally involve monitoring links incident victim analyzing patterns arriving departing traffic determine attack occurred 
final category focuses identifying source dos attacks presence ip spoofing
