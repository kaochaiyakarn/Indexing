particular line gaming requires low latency point point communication directed broadcast channels facilitate real time game logic 
addition traffic tends employ small highly periodic udp packets 
packets small application requires extremely low latencies message aggregation impractical 
packets highly periodic result game dynamic requirement frequent predictable state updates clients servers 
packets sent udp clients typically send packets interval shorter time take retransmit lost packets
