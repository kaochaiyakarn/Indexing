rdf rdf general purpose knowledge representation language flexible data model fulfil needs 

expression service parameters rdf basic rdf data model consists object types resource property statements 
resources central concept rdf 
describe web pages people 
properties express specific aspects characteristics attributes relations describe resource 
statements composed specific resource named property value property resource 
value resource turn 
alternatively value literal primitive term evaluated rdf processor 
rdf models consist bag statements represented directed labelled graphs example 
rdf statement rdf neutrally representing knowledge associating specific semantic representation need state interpretation going attach representation 
interpretation depend context

advertisements rdf describe advertisement rdf graph defines space possible realizations services expressing particular realization service

req previous section 
represents example advertisement 
advertisement terms represented belong ontologies shared different parties involved matchmaking session 
sake example modelled services sale delivery 
service sale defines set items total price sale intention advertiser buy sell 
product specify quantity 
turn quantity expressed measure volume weight 
delivery service defines charge delivery date origin destination locations 
advertisement represented rdf resource type advertisement result uri

rdf sub graph representing advertisement highlighted colour

argued advertisements express constraints possible realizations service 
rdf useful dealing kinds constraints 
typing constraints say node certain type subtype supertype

matching advertisement enriched ontologies design decisions matching advertisements reduced matching rdf graphs 
implemented matching algorithm visitor pattern 
algorithm implemented java jena rdf api 
advertisements match root nodes instances advertisement match respective sub nodes 
visitor pattern defined default matching rules mechanism overridden nodes particular types 
association overriding matching rule node type done annotating rdfs schema 
precisely property added node representing class resource 
value property literal expresses fully qualified name java class implements matching rules resources type 
default matching rule 
main idea traverse simultaneously advertisements finding recursively nodes share common type making sure incompatibilities advertisements 
algorithm description ignore possibility cycles simplicity explanation 
advertisements match root node match 
nodes match subtype 
matching rule defined specialised common type nodes matching rule evaluated positive 
default matching rule property appears node exists node subproperty object nodes match 
matching algorithm rdf graphs go back flower advertisement related ontologies examine light matching algorithm 
buyer interested having advertisement matched compatible advertisements sellers 
rest sub section show advertisement match buyer 
buyer advertised purchase kg red roses

see discussion subsection 
buyer advertisement examples easily expressed syntax illustrated far 
advertisement need devise mechanism express resolve constraint expression appears seller advertisement 
prototype matchmaker designed proprietary syntax express constraints directly value slot instance 
example express advertisement sale quantity roses kg set literal corresponding rdf value literal 
matching algorithm parses value string interprets constraint 
drawback approach sole syntax 
overcome problem envisage design constraint ontology allow annotate nodes advertisement graph representing instance particular kind constraint example 
expect minimal impact design implementation matching algorithm 
discussion far focussed advertisements
