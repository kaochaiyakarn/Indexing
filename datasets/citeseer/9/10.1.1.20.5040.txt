definition abstraction mapping propose novel perspective abstraction originating observation concept representation deals entities belonging different levels 
underlying source experience world concrete objects real things reside 
world really known mediated access perception 
important observer world se perception 
level percepts exist observer perceived 
reality consists physical stimuli produced observer 
order stimuli available time memorized organized structure structure extensional representation van dalen perceived world stimuli related stored tables 
set tables constitutes relational database relational algebra operators applied 
order reason perceived world communicate agents language needed 
allows perceived world described intensionally 
language level operate inference rules 
define reasoning context 
consider static situations world change time usual situation addressed machine learning 
levels corresponding respectively may complex links interplay 
investigation links scope pertains philosophy psychology 
note levels proposed framework generated upwards fact primary source information tries record verbally describes 
relationships considered levels represented 
description perception memorization levels reason world 
perception objects matter fact links 
set tables grouping sets objects sharing property 
formal language semantics evaluated tables

instance notions consider case sources emit different monochromatic lights 
sources may unspecified unknown contains retina stimuli produced incoming photons 
visual stimuli organized table stimulus source associated example wavelength 
point symbols may arbitrarily assigned stimulus red blue green table contains color 
previous approaches abstraction defined mapping languages structures implicitly considered sets models 
approach modifications structure language introduced describe differences occurred perception world 
perception may change reasons instance visual perception may modified tool eyes pair sun glasses binocular 
may purposely ignore details consider relevant current goal 
cases world change se perception changes 
machine learning definition corresponds phase feature selection 
considerations think abstraction defined primarily mapping level perceived world 
world perception system consisting set sensors devoted reception particular signal 
sensor resolution threshold establishes minimum difference signals order consider distinct 
set values provided sensors called signal pattern configuration 
recognizing configurations important observer action may associated configuration 
set possible configurations detectable 
example consider world constituted matrix pixels 
retina resolution pixel 
retina contains threshold receptors pixel bright 
set specific assignment value pixels 
consider perception system acting world consisting retina lower resolution retina analyze squares pixels outputs iff pixels bright 
case configuration uniquely obtained corresponding configuration majority voting algorithm 
possible recover uniquely configuration derived additional information provided instance explicit link 
say simpler offers observer information manipulate 
price paid lower cognitive burden computational load artificial system decreasing information world 
lack information bad correct action performed response recognition state fine tuned lack information may result wrong action 
contrary case point handling information needed part observer cognitive effort freed attending task 
definition world perception systems corresponding configuration sets 
perception system said simpler iff function starting configuration uniquely determines configuration inverse function exist configuration uniquely reconstructed additional information 
intuitively simpler means information apparent hidden definition advantage linking simplicity semantic meaning done manipulate information syntactic expression 
obviously syntactic complexity language may enter simplicity evaluation perceptual system syntactic complexity implies handle conveyed information 
considerations position provide formal definition abstraction 
definition world reasoning contexts conventionally label ground 
abstraction functional mapping perception simpler perception world function allows configuration uniquely determined ground vice versa additional information
