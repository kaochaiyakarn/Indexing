model degree represents claims features dialogue important sufficiently understood operationally defined 
partial distributions features relationship possible manifestations dialogues class empirical question 
view dialogue tagging scheme partial model class dialogues implies pre existing tagging scheme re different research project different researchers degree models natural class respect similar research questions sufficient expressing observations occurs current dialogues interest sufficiently defined high reliability research sites achieved
