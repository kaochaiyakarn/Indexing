general prompting metaphor constructing game provided meaningful frame elicitation process motivated participants 
need develop prompting aids described elicitation task difficult participants 
important lessons learned procedure able obtain reasonably minimal effort nearly questions 
adequate create reliable valid instrument 
elicitation interview took approximately minutes 
entire collection effort required business days researcher time 
asking questions located additional organizational resources msc generate questions 
resources included system documentation questions training manuals questions generated user group meetings 
resources pilot study preferring test kmi elicitation process 
generating question answer sets challenging cognitive task 
proved demanding participants 
asked participant produce question answer cards 
participants able generate usable card readily supplied times amount requested 
participants equal facility composing multiple choice questions 
example writing multiple wrong answers clearly wrong obviously wrong quite difficult 
compounded time social pressures fifteen minutes researcher audio recording process 
began collecting data needed create formalized elicitation interview set prompting props 
developed sample cards slots question multiple choice answers correct answer challenging incorrect answers 
freeform thought particular question form drive interaction ensuring completed card 
prompting props cards helpful structuring data collection ensuring participants generated complete sets answers 
retrospect asked people generate questions decontextualized setting conference room office 
provided limited environmental cues prompt question generation limited local resources verify correctness answers 
needed researcher elicitation process 
attempts having participants generate questions replying email person visit futile 
researchers maintain motivation prompt case partial responses provide supportive feedback iterative design questions 
attempted get participants rank difficulty questions 
unable noting rank absence specific task referent group
