information extraction text extracting information text challenging task natural language processing researchers key problem real world applications 
years nlp community substantial progress developing systems achieve performance information extraction tasks limited domains 
opposed depth natural language processing information extraction focused goal oriented task 
example muc task extract information terrorist events names perpetrators victims instruments approach technique called selective concept extraction 
selective concept extraction form text skimming selectively processes relevant text effectively ignoring surrounding text thought irrelevant domain 
conceptual sentence analyzer called circus lehnert 
extract information text circus relies domain specific dictionary concept nodes 
concept node essentially case frame triggered lexical item activated specific linguistic context 
concept node definition contains set enabling conditions constraints satisfied order concept node activated 
example dictionary terrorism domain contains concept node called passive extracts kidnapping events 
concept node triggered word kidnapped enabling conditions allow activated context passive construction 
result concept node activated phrases kidnapped kidnapped similarly dictionary contains second concept node called triggered word kidnapped enabling conditions allow activated context active construction terrorists kidnapped mayor 
addition concept node definition contains set slots extract information surrounding context 
terrorism domain concept nodes slots perpetrators victims instruments slot syntactic expectation set hard soft constraints filler 
syntactic expectation specifies filler expected linguistic context 
example passive contains victim slot expects filler subject clause mayor kidnapped 
slot constraints selectional restrictions slot filler 
hard constraints satisfied order slot filled soft constraints suggest semantic preferences slot filler slot may filled soft constraint violated 
sentence input circus generates set instantiated concept nodes output 
multiple triggering words appear sentence circus generate multiple concept nodes sentence 
triggering words sentence circus generate output sentence 
concept node dictionary heart selective concept extraction 
concept nodes circus output text concept node dictionary crucial effective information extraction

seventeen sites industry academia participated muc 
task extract information terrorist events latin america newswire articles 
text system required fill template terrorist event described text 
text described multiple terrorist events template completed event 
text mention terrorist events templates needed filled 
template essentially large case frame set pre defined slots piece information extracted text 
example muc templates contained slots perpetrators human targets physical targets training corpus texts instantiated templates answer keys text available participants development purposes 
texts selected keyword search database newswire articles 
text contained keyword associated terrorism half texts contained specific relevant terrorist incident 
design autoslog observations central design autoslog 
observation news reports follow certain stylistic conventions 
particular important facts news event typically reported initial event description 
details secondary information described 
follows major component event victim perpetrator usually occurs sentence describes event 
example story kidnapping probably mention kidnapped reports secondary information family observation key design autoslog 
autoslog operates assumption targeted piece information relationship information event explicit 
identified sentence contains specific piece information determine words phrases activate concept node extract information 
second key observation autoslog immediate linguistic context surrounding targeted information usually contains words phrases describe role event 
example consider sentence kidnapped today 
sentence contains important pieces information kidnapping victim perpetrator 
cases word kidnapped key word relates kidnapping event 
passive form expect subject verb kidnapped victim expect prepositional phrase contain perpetrator 
word kidnapped specifies roles people kidnapping appropriate word trigger concept node 
autoslog relies small set heuristics determine words phrases activate useful concept nodes 
section describe heuristics explain autoslog generates complete concept node definitions 
automated dictionary construction set training texts associated answer keys autoslog proposes set concept node definitions capable extracting information answer keys texts 
concept node definitions general nature expect useful extracting information novel texts 
algorithm constructing concept node definitions follows 
targeted piece information string template autoslog finds sentence text contains string 
step observation noted earlier object place related event 
sentence handed circus generates conceptual analysis sentence 
analysis autoslog identifies clause sentence contains string 
set heuristics applied clause suggest conceptual anchor point concept node definition 
heuristics satisfied autoslog searches sentence text contains targeted information process repeated 
conceptual anchor point heuristics important part autoslog 
conceptual anchor point word activate concept circus triggering word 
heuristic looks specific linguistic pattern clause surrounding targeted string 
linguistic pattern represents phrase set phrases activating concept node 
heuristic successfully identifies pattern clause generates things conceptual anchor point set enabling conditions recognize complete pattern 
example suppose autoslog clause kidnapped targeted string 
string appears subject clause followed passive verb kidnapped heuristic recognizes pattern subject passive verb satisfied 
heuristic returns word kidnapped conceptual anchor point enabling conditions require passive construction 
build actual concept node definition conceptual anchor point triggering word enabling conditions included ensure concept node activated response desired linguistic pattern 
example final concept node activated phrases kidnapped kidnapped kidnapped current version autoslog contains heuristics designed recognize specific linguistic pattern 
patterns shown examples illustrate text 
bracketed item shows syntactic constituent string slot expectation dobj direct object np noun phrase preposition 
examples right bracketed item slot name associated filler subject victim 
underlined word conceptual anchor point triggering word 
linguistic pattern example subject victim subject perpetrator subject perpetrator subject victim passive verb murdered active verb bombed verb infinitive attempted kill auxiliary noun victim passive verb dobj killed victim active verb dobj bombed target infinitive dobj kill victim verb infinitive dobj threatened attack target gerund dobj killing victim noun auxiliary dobj victim noun prep np bomb target active verb prep np killed instrument passive verb prep np aimed target additional parts concept node definition specified slot extract information hard soft constraints slot type 
syntactic constituent string slot expectation 
previous example string subject clause concept node defined slot expects filler subject clause 
name slot victim comes template slot information originally 
order generate domain dependent concept nodes auto requires domain specifications 
specifications set mappings template slots concept node slots 
example information human target slot template maps victim slot concept node 
second set domain specifications hard soft constraints type concept node slot example constraints specify legitimate victim 
concept node type 
concept nodes accept event types template bombing kidnapping want special types 
third set domain specifications mappings template types concept node types 
general targeted information kidnapping template kidnapping concept node type 
terrorism domain special types information perpetrator instrument template slots perpetrators instruments principle passive verbs objects 
included pattern circus occasionally confused active passive constructions 
principle concept nodes multiple slots extract multiple pieces information 
concept nodes generated autoslog single slot 
appear sentences describe nature event claimed responsibility refer bombing kidnapping 
sample concept node definitions illustrate process comes show examples concept node definitions generated autoslog 
shows relatively simple concept node definition activated phrases bombed bombed autoslog created definition response input string public buildings physical target slot bombing template text dev muc 
shows sentence text contains string public buildings 
circus analyzed sentence identified public buildings subject clause 
heuristic pattern subject passive verb generated concept node word bombed triggering word enabling conditions require passive construction 
concept node contains single variable slot expects filler subject clause labels target string came physical target template slot 
constraints physical targets pulled domain specifications 
concept node type bombing input string came bombing template 
id dev muc slot filler public buildings sentence la department central mountain range public buildings bombed car bomb 
concept node name target subject passive verb bombed trigger bombed variable slots target constraints class phys target constant slots type bombing enabling conditions passive concept node definition shows example concept node complicated enabling conditions 
case circus targeted string subject clause time different heuristic fired 
heuristic pattern subject verb infinitive matched phrase threatened murder generated concept node word murder trigger combined enabling conditions require preceding words threatened threatened active construction 
concept node slot expects filler subject clause expects perpetrator slot filler came perpetrator variable slots slots extract information 
constant slots pre defined values autoslog specify concept node type 
template slot 
constraints associated perpetrators incorporated concept node assigned type perpetrator domain specifications map perpetrator template slots perpetrator types concept nodes 
note concept node extract direct object threatened murder victim 
need separate concept node definition pick victim 
id dev muc slot filler sentence mar today threatened murder individuals involved mar presidential elections resign posts 
concept node name perpetrator subject verb infinitive threatened murder trigger murder variable slots perpetrator constraints class perpetrator constant slots type perpetrator enabling conditions active trigger preceded 
threatened concept node definition preceding definitions clearly useful domain terrorism definitions autoslog generates dubious quality 
shows example bad definition 
autoslog finds input string direct object clause constructs concept node triggered word took active verb 
concept node expects victim direct object type kidnapping 
concept node appropriate sentence general want generate kidnapping concept node time see word took 
id dev muc slot filler sentence took year old son rodriguez year old andres son 
concept node name victim active verb dobj took trigger took variable slots victim dobj constraints class victim dobj constant slots type kidnapping enabling conditions active bad concept node definition autoslog generates bad definitions reasons sentence contains targeted string describe event observation mentioned earlier hold heuristic proposes wrong conceptual anchor point cir cus incorrectly analyzes sentence 
potentially dangerous definitions prompted include human loop weed bad concept node definitions
