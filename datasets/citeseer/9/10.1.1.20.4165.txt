tv program guide dialogue system architecture 
interpretation manager interpretation manager robust chart parser produces feature structure representing user utterance objects properties system user reason 
feature structure consists markers handle distinctions task requests database queries system requests questions system capabilities dialogue management greetings 
parser uses lexicons context free grammars capable shallow parsing skip words user utterance included lexicon produce parse tree 
steps involved building lexicon 
corpus automatically tokenized list words produced 
duplicates removed list 
second list sorted syntactic categories 
result word list words form basis lexicon 
small corpus case lexicon manually completed synonyms related vocabulary 
example weekdays added monday friday occurred original list 
tokenization includes identification lexical units abbreviations done manually case 
words ambiguous need considered generation lexicon grammar verb noun show 
created lexicon serves generic static resource tv program domain independently actual instances titles channels included database 
accommodate actual instances second lexicon created automatically database content 
necessary include program titles channels actors presenters directors categories lexicon system understand user question deals explicit channels titles second lexicon dynamic nature constantly updated new tv shows added tableaus database 
ad vantage keeping lexicons dynamic lexicon exchanged example daily weekly basis interfering static lexicon 
third lexicon needed temporal expressions temporal grammar discussed 
lexicons loaded system start 
grammars system 
domain specific grammar modeling phrases encountered tv program domain 
grammar uses static dynamic lexicon 
second grammar generic grammar temporal expressions uses temporal lexicon 
grammars loaded produce feature structure user utterance 
typical user utterance tv domain consists phrase belonging domain specific grammar phrase consisting temporal information belonging temporal grammar 
consider example movies bbc tomorrow night 
domain specific grammar handles part utterance identifying user naming category movies specific channel bbc 
temporal grammar handles part utterance identifying necessary deictic tomorrow relation utterance parsed structures grammars unified feature structure 
structure dm 
dialogue management dm incrementally builds dialogue tree interaction session progresses 
dialogue tree encapsulates notions dialogue history record said user system interaction focus management topic currently discussed 
dialogue tree consists level structure top level structured discourse segments 
segment called initiative response node divided dialogue moves 
focus handling represented horizontally dialogue tree sub dialogues built vertically utilizing dialogue grammar 
dialogue history allows anaphora resolution example james bond movie 
presents actor information chosen james bond film 
directed 
presents director information film 
case dialogue tree keeps record current focus james bond movie earlier result set 
information utterance assumed involve property director james bond movie object 
certain phrases contain markers focal shift 
markers identified utterance level discourse level 
example series questions certain movie user want know news broadcast 
system abandon search criteria connected discussed movie actor director properties 
certain search criteria valid new focus temporal information 
dialogue manager encounters marker signals new focus new discourse segment created dialogue tree old abandoned 
sub dialogue catered vertically adding nodes dialogue tree 
happens example user request results hits show movies hits 
system keeps focus previous queries takes initiative 
case hits system keeps category focus movies asks user specific day channel 
system sub dialogue correct misconceptions 
example user asks actors show property news shows system informs user news actors 
system continues ask user wants view news shows wants name show actors movie 
dm gets domain knowledge dkm 
domain knowledge management dkm responsible reasoning aspects connected domain 
case dkm possesses knowledge relations entities world tv shows 
contains temporal reasoning capabilities temporal reasoner tr 
tr holds temporal knowledge set heuristics interpreting vague user notions time tonight tomorrow afternoon convert date instances compared starting times dates database 
tr operates part feature structure produced temporal grammar lexicon 
information needed constructing queries dealing starting times various tv shows 
interpreting meaning temporal information feature structure dkm utilizes database manager formulate valid database query feature structure 
database manager responsible executing query collecting result set 
exceptional results empty large result sets dkm informs dm initiates clarification sub dialogue see 
response management response manager responsible generating system response 
typically answer consists collected result set database 
result screen graphical user interface 
case sub dialogue response manager generate simple natural language responses 
done canned templates customized depending situation 
method qualitative method observations interviews study 
purpose study explorative collect information users experiences interaction system testing 
study conducted home environment represents normal living room environment nokia home communications sweden 
users prior experiences menu program guide participated study task scenarios 
aim scenarios correspond real life situations find tv programs particular movie general information program general description movie specific information director main actor movie 
user task scenarios 
users observed tested system observations documented test leader 
test follow interview undertaken user 
purpose interviews yield qualitative assessments system satisfaction experiences user interface 
interviews documented test leader 
results documentation observations interviews transcribed analyzed organizing material categories 
design issues appeared categories freedom interaction mode concentration information load unclear data quantity type increased system efficiency lack mixed initiative 
user interaction spoken input acceptable users preferred multimodal input direct manipulation speech input combined 
direct manipulation conducted means remote control 
users mentioned situations remote control

know express query 
information load users considered information load carried system regarded positive result 
users find searching knowledge desired object limited 
users need exactly know looking long relevant knowledge 
example ford tonight 
displays list tv program includes word ford title channel start category air force sky film devil movie film ford bbc documentary data quantity type users expressed initially regarded system knowledgeable fact 
system understood answered questions users learn system access data 
unclear extent systems capabilities 
users considered system sufficient database expressed uncertainty type amount data available 
example users know search categories action movies 
combination knowing data system supplied kind data supplied users felt system provide desired information 
users surprised interaction progressed 
efficiency system considered effective menu program guide reasons 
related user input natural language flexibility contributed efficiency amount information query limited 
system dialogue history enabled users continue working iteratively certain topic 
example movies tonight 
system shows list title channel start tv friends tv hell sky movie tv pretty woman movie ones clock please system show list title channel start tv pretty woman movie pretty woman 
system shows description film second reason related system output 
system delivered search results matched query users received relevant significant information superfluous information included 
mixed initiative system considered passive users preferred system initiative way user receive alternative choices suggestions query give results 
example friends shown clock 
system reply friends shown everyday 
spin city shown 
discussion results case study gave indications lack interface design 
users felt system provided data fact 
unaware type data available 
grounds issues lack graphical interface type amount data database viewed graphically users gradually understood system knowledge limited initially assumed 
suggestion provide information graphically having informative field types data listed 
increase system efficiency users knowledge system increased affect queries 
way increase system efficiency increase system initiative 
providing system initiative supplies user information 
useful problematic 
hand user receives information source inspiration 
information irrelevant confuse contribute 
case study shows real risk users considered system efficient delivered relevant information superfluous 
way overcome problem adapt system users behavior learning user behavior having users provide knowledge directly 
ibrahim johansson mentioned lack feedback dialogue 
building system mixed initiative system operative feedback dialogue feeling increased 
study users preferred availability communication modalities speech input direct manipulation means remote control combined 
cohen claims communication modalities available integrated 
claim supports proposal integrate modalities 
providing combination requires re design user interface way support input integrated modalities 
integration raises new design problems considered carefully 
iteration design evaluation necessary order collect design knowledge 
various aspects case study investigated 
integrating remote control manipulation speech input built evaluated 
second impact system user modeling capabilities investigated 
third need investigate system considered intelligent efficient provides initiative dialogue 
combining advantages graphical spoken direct manipulated interface ease system 
combination demands thorough design multimodal interface order modalities 
yankelovich claims building speech systems done scratch case study suggests holds sort multimodal system 
case study gives indication positive attitudes multimodal interaction interactive tv communication modes spoken natural language input direct manipulation means remote control provided visual representation
