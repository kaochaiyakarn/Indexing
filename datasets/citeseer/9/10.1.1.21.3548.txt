requests distributed uniformly general inter arrival times roughly follows exponential distribution 
studies shown streaming accesses exhibit diurnal patterns :10.1.1.66.4875
call phenomena seasonal patterns hourly daily weekly patterns 
users request streaming objects particular periods making uniform distribution requests spanning time synthetic workload unrealistic 
requests distribution inter arrival time requests object result phenomena popularity distribution objects temporal correlation requests 
skew web object popularity directly related skew interarrival time distribution 
skew increased temporal correlations requests 
streaming media accesses need model phenomena 
popularity distribution skewed popularity streaming media objects documented 
particular studies observed zipf distribution streaming object popularity

partial accesses resulting need model duration aborted session 
unfortunately empirical studies characterizing partial accesses 
implies stopping time time session stopped uniformly exponentially distributed :10.1.1.66.4875
stopping occur stream playout 
model behavior pareto distribution 
choice stopping probability decreases session grows longer indicating interest streamed content lower probability 
pareto distribution models behaviors 
intra session jumps resulting fast forward rewind activity need model distribution jump distances 
previous jump distances tend small large jumps uncommon 
current implementation gismo model jump distances pareto distributions 
addition jump distances need model duration continuous play intra jump times 
current implementation gismo assume duration continuous play follows exponential distribution frequency jumps 
pareto distribution shape parameter scale parameter complementary cdf means random variable time case probability larger conditional probability user proceed 

grows larger gets larger 
notice random variable pareto distribution arbitrary large partial accesses jumps random variable stopping time jump distance bounded exceed size object
