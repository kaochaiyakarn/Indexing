irv architecture existing bgp security approaches widely deployed reasons include limited ability incrementally deployed high computational costs infeasibility modifying vast installed base bgp implementations 
recognizing limitations propose interdomain routing validation irv architecture 
conjunction bgp irv validate bgp data acquire additional routing information relevant 
irv goals allow ases acquire validate static policy dynamic current route advertisements interdomain routing information 
incrementally deployable system provide substantial benefit limited adoption 
allow ases securely differentiate requesters routing information order responses tailored recipient 
tightly coupled bgp protocol operate independently reception bgp messages ases free validate acquire routing information desire 
allow ases passively receive routing relevant information remote entities permit collections participating ases cooperatively monitor debug routing infrastructure

example may want restrict access data concerning private peering relationships 
note irv need respond uniformly requesters irv may configured restrict access particular data list authorized requesters 
mandate irv authenticate source queries view authentication essential routing environments 
bgp model requires update message propagated virtually unmodified traverses routers

may beneficial cache previously acquired policy route information 
cached values avoid revalidation stable information origin information associated frequently changing routes irv mandate queries sent 
algorithm chosen determine cost associated validation 
significant benefit irv parties need validation information update

approach vary frequency queries asn 
ases topologically closer deemed relevant may queried frequently

irv requesters communicate directly tailor responses 

finding irv important consideration irv architecture way irv associated located 
obvious approach embed hint address irv update messages 
address authenticated subsequent communication irv known certificate 
design require modification existing bgp implementations view highly undesirable 
alternative approach institute known registry store distribute authoritative irv contact information 
irv contact registry need store irv location information ip addresses 
implementation registry need complex 
example central registry may redirection dns records communicate irv location 
preceding sections implied globally unique asn true 
rfc specifies set singly homed ases upstream provider share single asn 
having unique irv associated essential certain uses irv architecture origin validation 
exist way disambiguating requests data associated rfc prefixes

rfc specifies asn singly homed shall number previously assigned provider private asn 
private asn stripped path provider requester incorrectly treat provider irv authoritative 
case provider may configure irv require requester specify prefix asn making queries 
alternatively irv field described section return pointer location proper irv 

authentication secure communication irv require security infrastructure essential countering threats interdomain routing 
necessary irv authenticate queries prevent unauthorized access sensitive data enforce access control routing information 
responses authenticated prevent forgery 
confidentiality may concern 
example peer clearly location information authenticated 
location service certificates configured router purpose 
rfc notes additional software provider obviate need distinct provider different singly homed customers 
ing relationships closely guarded secrets 
case peers may desire confidentiality prevent exposure relationships 
confidential communication may enable new kinds interaction parties free share changing data deemed sensitive advertised publicly 
course queried information deemed sensitive authentication confidentiality optional 
queries responses authenticated digital signatures 
approach requires means distributing public keys may consume significant computational resources 
note costs reduced caching reusing frequently requests responses 
caches need carefully designed incorrect implementations may introduce vulnerabilities replay attack timeliness bounds established enforced cached requests responses 
computational costs associated digital signatures place significant burden resource limited routers 
bgp irr validating entity irv direct communication representative relevant

extending irv queries described preceding sections irv provides clear benefit receivers routing information

traditional way expressing routing policy provides structures describe import policies export policies forwarding defaults route preferences route flap dampening measures various specific policy declarations

potential uses protocol combined need extensibility suggest flexible convenient language expressing routing relevant information required

examples section illustrates irv mitigate interdomain routing failures representative examples 
examples discuss failures resulting misconfiguration discuss failures resulting malicious behavior attacks 
considering common failures resulting bgp misconfiguration identified mahajan 

origin misconfiguration 
origin misconfiguration occurs inadvertently inserts prefix global bgp tables 
failures type classified self related origin propagation foreign origin propagation 
self announces prefixes aggregated unnecessarily advertising specific prefixes 
related origin failures occur prefixes remain local propagated 
foreign origin propagation occurs claims ownership prefix 
misconfigurations result configuration errors poor router synchronization application incorrect route attributes unwarranted reliance upstream filtering 
way detect related foreign origin misconfigurations requiring proof ownership appropriate irv 
proofs may consist digitally signed statements binding prefixes ases 
statements issued appropriate prefix authority ripe 
developers bgp explored various architectures provide proofs 
design external observers incomplete information manages prefixes routes 
reason detecting preventing self difficult 
currently provide specific mechanism addresses failures expect irv supplied information stating maximal permissible prefix handling policy aid detecting failures 

export misconfiguration 
failures resulting ex port misconfigurations occur route violates policy propagated 
misconfigurations result sub optimal routes violation agreements 
routing registries designed reduce incidence errors resulting export misconfiguration ases registries verify update messages consistent policy received 
irv mitigates export misconfiguration acting local route registry 
example assume receives route contains 
receiving retrieve policy irv associated asn locating interface known irv 
resulting records validate route information existing verification procedures 
xquery expression acquire relevant policy doc framework return framework policy return policy return policy framework note may advantageous delay multiple xquery requests sent irv 
single request issued threshold queries reached 
request costs amortized potentially queries 
similar reasons may advantageous cache results queries serve requests cache 

announcement forgery 
route announcements potentially sensitive 
ases propagation path bgp update message able modify advertised withdrawn routes corresponding path attributes 
ases path means determining modifications taken place 
announcement forgeries detected obtaining direct verification origin 
example suppose receives announcement prefix originated 
obtains verification requesting announcements associated prefix 
request communicated xquery expression doc framework return framework return update equal nlri framework intend send announcements bgp irv 
verification successor information bgp irv prefix response contains records safely ignore announcement 
sends record update messages currently forwarding neighbors 
note solution secure communication ases authenticated digitally signed responses authenticated transport ssl tls ipsec 

forged propagation 
bgp origin information unforgeable malicious able alter advertised path path 
malicious entities may alter path increase decrease desirability route assert control flow traffic simply deny service 
users irv detect forged paths seeking confirmation path 
query similar previous example sent irv path 
requesting verifies asn path recipient entry appropriate record 
illustrated irv path verification semantically equivalent bgp route attestations 
paths validated needed direct communication issuing data carried bgp update 
irv allow recipient decide perform verification ensures achieve partial benefit partial adoption 

discussion important consider irv fits universe tools support internet domain routing 
particular assess irv relates techniques interdomain policy security services 
illustrates similarities differences related bgp security proposals comparing irv bgp 
discussion general policy dis tribution 
central goal bgp support validation crucial data interdomain routing path properties route information prefix ownership origin information 
route advertisements bgp provide authenticating information signatures 
signature route contents commits update 
signature indirectly supporting pki prevents forgery 
costs associated generating distributing validating signatures update messages prohibitively high 
irv considers different model originating commits resources validation verifying requests confirmation 
interaction session oriented may represent long term associations validation may amortized update messages may low cost symmetric cryptography long term ipsec security association persistent tls session 
services prepared support potentially large community users 
proposed bgp cryptographically supported validation prefix ownership requires existence governing body icann certificate issuer 
available irv validating block governance advertising ownership proving credentials query interfaces infrastructure necessary 
existing governing bodies provide validation infrastructure technical challenges doing indicate deployment near term highly 
complicated incomplete knowledge address ownership 
near term flagging investigating inconsistencies validating ownership may provide best means ensuring correct origin information 
note irv provide strong prefix ownership validation governing authority mitigate route misconfiguration 
detection misconfigured bgp speaker update prefix belonging detected associated update validation 
case ownership cross referenced data advertised administrative server 
course sources misconfigured malicious error detected 
routing registries rrs provide access routing policies participating ases 
rr consumers alter routing behavior infrastructure policy content 
note infrastructure inherently egalitarian user rr access policy data 
uniform access desirable 
peering relationships identity state routing infrastructure connectivity frequently considered highly sensitive 
result ases provide non sensitive policy rr reducing usefulness 
provides irv server 
may exert control policy distributed 
example may wish expose information ases carrying traffic 
ases need provided information routing infrastructure supports relationship 
facilities may open door new kinds cooperative behavior bgp neighbors 

accessing dynamic data arguments previous sections assume irv servers access dynamic data question irv servers gain access dynamic data important 
section describe readily deployable architecture achieves goal 
adoption particular approach required system believe provide necessary functionality 
specification irv servers access kinds dynamic routing information cached bgp update messages received neighboring bgp speakers 
message associated particular bgp speaker forwarded 
set currently valid update messages sent neighboring bgp listeners including update messages originating locally forwarded 
message associated set neighboring ases message sent 
access bgp update messages received neighboring bgp speakers irv server simply establish bgp sessions border routers way bgp messages received peer ases irv 
illustrates dark lines bgp sessions propagating routing information received routers irv able determine identity bgp peer corresponding foreign bgp speaker propagated message local 
event router case bgp sessions router case may necessary configure bgp listener locally private community fields path attributes signal irv identity foreign speaker 
clearly malicious compromised routers manipulate local irv services arbitrarily omitting delaying modifying bgp messages 
protection routers explicitly outside domain irv 
assume ases employ additional infrastructure detect disable faulty compromised routers 
note centric router centric solution contend issues 
bgp routers irv 
dynamic data acquisition irv 
maintaining current information regarding bgp date messages sent foreign ases challenging 
particular convenient way intercept outbound bgp sessions traverse direct physical link bgp speaker listener 
outbound bgp session recommend configuring corresponding border router establish second outbound bgp session irv configured send data corresponding session remote 
gray lines reflect 
border routers serve bgp speakers multiple bgp sessions establish multiple bgp sessions irv 
irv bgp listener configured treat bgp session authoritative respect original outbound bgp session mirrors 
related issue involves question issues requests behalf 
possible operators query irv manually scheduled scripts access current routing data 
order take full advantage system able systematically form queries response received date messages 
purpose recommend establishing irv client system called network management element 
irv client listens bgp messages bgp listeners border collects forming sending useful queries 
irv server listens bgp messages may sense collocate irv client server physical machine
