query mediation extensively studied literature different kinds mediation models various source capabilities

web query mediation closely related follow local view approach 
systems describe source contents terms mediator schema resulting query rewriting algorithms efficient implementations evaluating query subsumption satisfiability

ontologies schema paths ontologies ontology quintuple source target isa set concepts ii set binary roles concepts iii functions source target map roles domain target concepts respectively iv isa inheritance relationship usual properties hierarchy 
ontology usually reflects common understanding certain domain 
case interested domain specific information stored xml databases define semantics ontology databases conform database ontology contains set objects instances concept related instances roles isa component interpreted subset semantics say concepts isa related isa isa holds 
example ontology cultural artifacts shown 
concepts roles describe actors persons performing activities producing artifacts 
example concept person collects persons subconcept actor inherits role performed relating actors activities 
isa activity produced actor person name string performed event took place place man object title material consists title technique procedure material technique place located born ontology cultural artifacts possible follow schema paths concepts ontology graph 
example artifacts produced actor obtained traversing role performed activities performed actors role produced artifacts produced activities 
observe traversal defines subset artifacts produced actor 
distinguish role paths defining derived roles concept paths defining virtual concepts 
role paths derived roles role path length sequence roles target source isa related 
source target role path defined source target extremities source source target target 
clearly composition role path role path denoted defined provided target source isa related 
role performed role path length source actor target activity 
role path length defines derived role rol instances source concept instances target concept 
example role path technique material length defines derived role rol technique material concept man object concept material

composition concept path role path denoted defined provided target source isa related 
concept path viewed defining virtual concept denoted con standing instances target reached source roles order 
example concept path person performed produced denotes artifacts instances concept man object produced person 
consider suffixes concept path define superconcepts virtual concept defined suffix concept path obtained removing prefix adding appropriate concept

corresponding dtd shown 
simple xml dtd artists art general mapping rules map xpath location paths schema paths ontology www art com artist person name name artifact performed produced title title procedure technique material material nationality born took place www art com artifact man object location located set mapping rules example rule states fragments element type artist descendants root document www art com see definition xpath patterns location paths instances concept person 
way rule states elements element type artifact descendants root document www art com instances concept man object 
rule creates instances derived role rol performed produced connecting element type artist obtained rule elements type artifact obtained applying xpath artifact 
mapping rules mapping rule expression form rule label rule root xpath location path optional binding variable schema path 
precisely root variable url role path variable concept path 
rule called relative mapping rule root variable absolute mapping rule 
lp cp denote location path schema path respectively 
rule interpreted follows apply location path instances variable obtained fragments added set instances variable variable add set instances derived role url add set instances virtual concept observe allow multiple bindings variable 
bindings reduce number mapping rules making structure easier understand 
opposite way possible map location path different variables order distinguish interpretations set fragments 
observe rule binds variable rule allows application rules instances rules obtain artifacts title technique 
set mapping rules define reachability rules variables follows rule root url reachable variable reachable variable bound reachable rule reachable 
mapping ontology set mapping rules labels unique rules label rules reachable variables concepts roles rules occur note binding relationships variables mapping may cyclic 
simplest case cycle rule left hand side contains provided reached url rules 
mapping cyclic contains binding cycle 
concatenation mapping rules rules concatenated composition schema paths defined note constraint root bound concatenation possible role path 
concatenation rule mapping closure denoted set rules obtained repeated concatenation 
expansion denoted set absolute rules 
ontology mapping defines view ontology om cm rm target isa cm set virtual concepts defined concept paths absolute rules rm set derived roles defined relative rules tree queries user views web portal single database fragments knowledge source fragment located 
consider fragment object identity location path fragment 
mapping allows organise fragments collections instances concepts om view certain xml paths representing roles om follows principle query database fragments query language oql 
answer query defined semantics queries object bases 
answer defined efficient evaluation requires effectively mapping translate query queries sources 
ability may depend form query 
introduce tree query language restricted version oql discuss mapping rules evaluation queries language 
tree queries select clauses schema paths 
shows tree queries general form tree query example query looks titles location man objects clay applied technique 
select 
select man object title 
technique material located clay 
tree queries tree query defined follows 
variables 
clause concept path defining virtual concept variable followed derived role case second case called binding path denoted bp 
partial order variables occurs clause called parent 
clause conjunction simple predicates form atomic value 
possible express joins equalities variables 
schema paths appear exclusively clause syntax simplifies presentation rewriting algorithm language quantifiers aggregates subqueries variable clause select clauses implicitly existentially quantified 
define restriction concatenation location paths rule left hand sides 
easy show query schema paths select clause rewritten equivalent query appear clause 
query rewriting evaluation query rewriting algorithm transforms tree query acyclic mapping query expressed xml query language 
algorithm consists phases binding rewriting phases 
phase try find rules schema paths map query paths second phase rewrite initial query set xpath expressions 
binding variables rules take example query mapping shown 
intuitively rules find man objects variable finds man objects produced person find man objects general 
rule find titles man objects values variable way rule finds material produce objects obtains instances variable formally variable rule binding shortly variable binding query mapping subset variables denoted dom 
precisely dom empty associates variable dom rule closure holds 
root query absolute mapping rule query binding path bp variable denotes superconcept virtual concept con cp om case bp equal suffix cp superconcept target 
declaration form child variable binding path answers obtained answers binding path root variable rule bound rule role denoted derived role rule rol cp equal role denoted binding path composition schema paths rules defined concatenation rules defined 
example query query root variable bound query real concept man object 
case concept path bp suffix cp person performed produced equal concept path cp 
binding path bp variable title need rule schema path leads man object virtual concept man object title rule rule 
similar reasoning applies binding variables binding algorithm variable binding full defined variables partial 
query need find full variable bindings mapping binding provides shown subset answer
