criteria real users relevance assessments tied state knowledge situation user 
higher order relevance refer relevance solely topicality criteria 
main problems laboratory model seen lack user oriented relevance sacrificing realism control 
consider situational relevance example higher order relevance 
ingwersen define situational relevance relation perceived situation task problem hand informa tion objects assessment 
incorporation higher order relevance evaluation brings interaction dynamic requests needs tasks evaluation improving realism evaluation 
situational task situation real user 
situational relevance retrieval explicit indexing features document problems higher order relevance ir systems design may discussed terms 
real user thrown situation may able recognize relevant document exclamation mark 
may difficulty discussing relevance criteria task situation 
certainly difficulty expressing request formulating query ir system topical long text concerned save bibliographic fields available discussed current systems provide 
system designer probably slightest idea explicit topical indexing features known pattern situational indexing features explicit text computer handle implicit features useful users see cooper 
available indexing features may correlate situational relevance criteria user express save thing topical relevance heavily correlates situational shown 
soon moves away collections consisting plain text structured docu ments possibilities applying situational relevance better 
example biblio graphic data document author journal year citations received may useful clues situational relevance people criteria rele vance assessments barry schamber barry schamber 
possible compile lists author names institution names journal conference names ranked order signal relevance task personal point view 
documents citing cited known relevant documents ranked higher documents lacking explicit features 
person person task task variation criteria may cause management problems criteria explicit may private 
conclude easy admit realism higher order rele vance criteria serving system features challenge lack understand ing variability criteria combination evidence criteria 
sense evaluating current algorithms performance criteria completely ignore save correlation topical higher order relevance 

novel performance measures relevance multilevel phenomenon documents relevant information need user 
multiple degrees relevance expression studied laboratory settings katter rees schultz tang shaw field studies information seeking retrieval 
groups experimented multiple point rating scales eleven 
tang shaw point scale relevance assessments optimal terms assessors confidence assessments 
practise ir evaluation binary scale norm 
unfortunate allow testing ir methods better particular degree relevance 
schamber referring katter rees schultz note measures recall precision binary judgements avoided ignore variability complexity relevance distort continuous nature relevance judgements 
ingwersen propose novel measures rela tive recall rr ranked half life rvelin kek inen meas ures discounted cumulated gain cg measures augmenting traditional ones see voorhees 
alternative avoiding recall precision generalise continuous relevance judgements incorporated computation proposed kek inen rvelin 
proposed measures allow subjective non binary multidimensional relevance assessments may augment recall precision evaluation 
new measures recall precision just measuring devices kind relevance assessments supplied 
immune way assessing relevance binary dynamic subjective
