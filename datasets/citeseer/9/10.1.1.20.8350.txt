color color treemaps powerful tool conveying information powerful shape suggested 
color benefits come liabilities combinations colors high saturation levels create optical illusions effects screen color deficiencies need taken account 
palette colors distinct hues provided color ranges 
hue divided separate colors altering brightness fixed intervals keeping saturation constant low level avoid undesirable color side effects 
colors chosen examples resemble spectrum sequence sequence type effective types saturation sequence gray scale 
gray scale representing internal hierarchy emphasizes leaf node colors 
users limited choices may select colors differently depending individual needs 
treemap displayed portfolio manager level treemap zoomed portfolio manager exaggeration aspect ratio problems subjects treemap experiment discussed observed incorrectly compare areas similar rectangles differing heights widths
