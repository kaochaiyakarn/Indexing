operations understood visually simple effects doi transfer functions illustrated 
zoom increases slope focal area decreases slope context pieces fixed amount available space 
adjust increases number cells focus area changing amount space occupied focus area slope focal area decrease 
slide pushes high slope area different spot axis 
important operation motivated actual coordinated adjust zoom 
common need increase decrease number cells focus affecting size 
requires doing adjust plus zoom add space focus preserve original cell sizes operation call adjust zoom 
multiple focal areas supported various operations done individual focal areas set 
single level interest desired zoom applied focal areas simultaneously adjust behaves poorly disallowed adjust zoom performed focal areas independently
