key words 
data warehouse design star snowflake schema independent separable database schema acyclic database schema 
data warehouse integrated time varying database primarily support management decision making inm cd 
data warehouse integrates heterogeneous data multiple distributed information sources contains historical aggregated data 
example sales data warehouse may contain information products sold time sale place sale sales person 
typically data warehouse orders magnitude larger operational database contain specific sales data contains details including details product range outlet locations personnel 
terms data modelling beneficial view data warehouse terms dimensional model composed central fact table set surrounding dimension tables corresponding components dimensions fact table 
example fact table models actual sales data dimension product detail time sale outlet product sold sales personnel modelled separate dimension table 
relational database terms fact table contains necessary foreign key attributes referencing primary keys constituent dimension tables 
conceptually leads star data structure called star schema 
dimensional modelling predates entity relationship modelling approach conventional way design relational database coupled normalisation theory ll 
star schemas refined snowflake schemas providing support attribute hierarchies allowing dimension tables tables 
example dimension table storing outlet product sold may table containing demographic information area sale 
debate benefits having tables general slow query processing cases provides necessary logical separation data case demographic information 
running example exhibit snowflake schema data warehouse keeping track students attendance college 
fact table schema atten dance dimension tables date room lecturer student course holiday date department lecturer student course 
clarity omitted labels edges edge tables intersection attributes 
snowflake schema structured way labels edges represent foreign primary key relationship parent table child 
meaning tables self evident attributes observing department represents department course department student belongs 
lecturer student course unique context particular department 
note derive complex schema having additional foreign keys lecturer student pertaining respective departments belong 
snowflake schemas enjoy relatively simple structure widely practice recommended data warehouse design methodologies aware date 
reason success intuitive easy understand amenable query optimisation arbitrary way joins fact table evaluated single pass fact table accommodate aggregate data easily extensible adding new attributes fact table dimension tables new dimension tables schema interfering existing database programs 
research formalising data warehouses graphtheoretic approach model snowflake schemas
