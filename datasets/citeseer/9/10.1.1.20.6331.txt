search engines search results users incomplete outdated usually leaving users confused frustrated 
second problem internet users encounter difficulty searching information particular website looking information related certain topic website www phoenix com 
popular commercial search engines offer search option limit search session specified website 
search engines index certain portion website recall rate searches low documents returned 
large websites nowadays builtin internal search engines engines index information different schemes policies users may difficulty uncovering useful information 
addition websites internet small sites internal search feature 
third problem poor retrieval rate single search engine 
estimated search engines available indexes total web indexed 
worse search engine maintains searching ranking algorithm query formation freshness standard 
different features search engine known searches inefficient ineffective 
user point view dealing array different interfaces understanding idiosyncrasies search engine burdensome 
development meta search engines alleviated problem 
different results combined user greatly affects effectiveness tools 
addition huge number daily hits search engines able provide computational power satisfy user information need 
analysis search results verifying web pages retrieved exist clustering web pages different categories available search engines 
search results usually ranked list fashion users get picture web pages click page read contents 
time consuming frustrating dynamic fast changing electronic information environment
