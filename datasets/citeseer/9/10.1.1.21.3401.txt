image similarity create visualisation set objects needs define way measuring similarity pair objects 
images annotated textual captions measure theory produce meaningful possible automatic arrangement image set clustering photographs depicting people places objects 
experiments information retrieval vector model binary term weighting cosine coefficient measure 
captions manually assigned expensive results highly subjective 
image retrieval researchers defined number measures automatically extracted visual features aim replacing supplementing conventional text measures

query retrieval purely visual measures far limited success rubner far aware show measures conjunction information visualisation techniques developed similar tools 
visual similarity measure explained detail briefly designed take account global image properties colours textures broad spatial layout image regions 
measures comparable effect 
constructing arrangements arrangements created multidimensional scaling mds technique treats inter object dissimilarities distances high dimensional space attempts approximate low dimensional commonly output configuration 
mds algorithms developed evaluated part separate research mds functions available common statistical packages 
arrange set images create similarity matrix containing measured similarity pairs images set 
mds configuration points matrix takes second items average pc thumbnail versions images placed points produce arrangement 
left hand part gives example visual similarity measure 
points configuration separated size thumbnail usually overlap images 
early experiments participants stated disliked overlap irregular structure difficult scan

ll click visual see 
straight away prefer darker going look side screen easier prefer visual arranging images visual similarity drawback usually encountered information visualisation fact visually similar images placed cause appear merge making eye catching separated random arrangement easier photo completely 
re merging eyes aren concentrating think re similar eye drawn set interesting images ignoring rest may help explain surprising results experiment fact searching faster random arrangement participants overwhelmingly favour visual arrangement part 
images potentially relevant especially search participants really know looking simply wanted scan set see 
case random arrangement helpful may enable strong image stand lost visually similar images may helpful understanding effect 
library saw selection mixed ones liked

regard individual differences tested person ability sense visualisation 
results appears important amount active searching prepared participants benefit similaritybased arrangement attempt narrow search content simply scan set eye catching photographs 
arrangement follow study main part experiment 
drawback making adjacent images appear merge experiment usefulness affected level detail captions 
corel captions tend focus names resulting arrangements usually job grouping photos particular area example czech republic set know prague area sort staying think got quite lot offer visually especially true grid experiment extra space allowed clusters obvious grid 
quote suggests main problem participants locating right part arrangement basis structure immediately obvious visual arrangement 
trying captions go 
alphabetical order showed follow participants mock consisted arrangement images short textual labels placed top see right hand part compare version labels left 
manually extracted captions images particular cluster 
elicited number positive comments believe features reliably created automatically great help users understanding structure arrangements 
automatically arranging set thumbnail images similarity useful designers especially wish narrow requirement particular subset 
arrangement helps break set meaning usefulness depends level detail available captions 
labels may necessary help user understand structure 
arrangement visual similarity helps divide set simple genres cause adjacent images appear merge effect observed information visualisation applications meaning user particular requirement mind random arrangement may useful strong images usually contrast neighbours appear stand 
evidence people having access different arrangements set images useful source individual differences conclusively pinned 
interesting investigate usefulness arrangements image browsing tasks different user populations particularly incorporated real system
