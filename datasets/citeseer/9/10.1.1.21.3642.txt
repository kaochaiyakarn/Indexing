explored applications sensor networks collaborated applications applications remain 
interesting direction explore collaborative signal processing interacts network processing filters 
focus wireless sensor networks techniques develop relevant wired sensor networks 
wired connections greatly reduce bandwidth constraints eliminate power constraints attribute naming reduce system complexity decoupling data sources sinks network processing may reduce latency improve scalability 
prior systems separately abstractions virtual information systems direction apply large wired sensor networks coupled physical world 

described approach distributed systems built attribute named data network processing 
attributes external meaning sensor type geographic location lowest levels communication approach avoids multiple levels name binding common approaches 
attribute named data turn enables network processing filters supporting data aggregation nested queries similar techniques critical reduce network traffic conserve energy 
evaluated effectiveness techniques quantifying benefits network processing data aggregation nested queries 
experiment aggregation reduces traffic nested queries reduces loss rates 
aggregation previously studied simulation experiments evaluation techniques operational testbed 
approaches important emerging domain wireless sensor networks network power resource constraints fundamental
