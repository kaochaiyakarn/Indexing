interactive television tv concept convergence traditional tv internet personal computer 
concept increases amount information provided user enables user interact access tv information new ways especially information regarding tv programs 
target user group tv entertainment vast usability demands interaction design high 
requires systems allow efficient natural user interaction give clear feedback user 
weaknesses directly manipulated graphical user interface result complex user interaction due restriction graphical interface caused things interaction technique example remote control 
design efficient user interface multimodal user interface strategy employed 
strategy combining modalities order offset weakness modality strength 
combining strengths graphical interfaces flexibility natural language nl dialogue interfaces efficient tv program guide system designed 
design interface order best combine modalities previously explored interactive tv domain 
johansson dept computer information science link ping university link ping sweden ida liu se comparison nl interface traditional menu interface showed users performed tasks better nl interface satisfied 
main advantage nl interfaces database information retrieval compared traditional graphical search interfaces nl better medium handling anaphora explicit expressions suitable dialogue systems better questions dealing negations universal quantifications 
nl appropriate describing objects time periods convenient expressing quantificational information 
speech ambient medium attentional possible interact system doing 
furthermore speech descriptive referential successfully combined modalities 
dialogue multimodal systems developed various domains timetable information electronic mail calendar weather information stock quotes interactive tv domain 
study recommends speech input complement remote control tv setting 
tv domain differs traditional computer domain ways distance tv screen user restricts amount information screen tv screens lower resolution computer monitors affects graphical representation tv entertainment purposes relaxed atmosphere user typically sitting sofa armchair computers previously related tv gives sound inappropriate applications spoken output

system architecture program guide modularized dialogue system main modules dialogue manager dm domain knowledge manager dkm 
dm central controller system directs information flow 
system handles various communicative acts divided task requests system requests communication management 
task requests involve factual information domain task specific issues system requests involve information system capabilities 
communication management handles general dialogue control greetings 
capabilities dm include dialogue history sub dialogue control clarification questions 
dialogue history allows anaphora resolution example james bond movie

feedback dialogue subjects expressed dissatisfaction system feedback reasons 
felt sure system understood enquiry 
user input viewed screen input field considered useful feedback subjects see system identified

third feedback provided considered cooperative participants wanted get result system input identified interpreted 
example show action movies tonight

implications multimodal interactive tv application design order improve performance dialogue systems issues dialogue feedback focused accuracy underlying speech recognition natural language processing technology 
way feedback essential graphical user interfaces essential dialogue multimodal systems 
feedback human computer interaction refers system communication user direct result user action providing user information state system conversation inform user result noteworthy event 
humans give feedback making language gestures body language 
strategies sufficiently give feedback multimodal systems today 
strategies giving user textual prompts state system making possibility introducing information visually appropriate 
example subjects study felt viewing input informative feedback 
indicates importance keeping user informed system planning 
addition combined informing user system act input order user informed system input interpretation 
way user opportunity interrupt system needed 
feedback provided spoken visually 
subjects prefer spoken feedback provided visually context 
case feeling dialogue affected dialogue partners different modalities spoken input visual output 
previously mentioned explanation lack dialogue feeling design visual output clearly separate domain results system status feedback 
system information window 
participants reported felt conversation tv program database dialogue partner 
order communicate dialogue feeling entity model proposed see 
model clear distinction dialogue partners user system domain reason 
user direct manipulation observation linguistic communication domain system domain information presentation 
entity interaction model 
distinction increase dialogue feeling user communicates system dialogue partner object tv program guide database 
similar model multimodal system 
interaction model dialogue approach defines dialogue collective act achieved partners speaker hearer 
hearer ground acknowledge speaker utterances order establish common ground 
distinction system object clearly reflected design interaction components play distinct roles system user interaction 
suggestion revised user interface dialogue system results consideration shown 
dialogue user system displayed upper user system areas domain results tv program information displayed bottom area 
user input area dialogue feedback area 
revised user interface entity interaction model 
interaction model taken consideration combining modalities 
information provided object system component visually user input speech possible combination direct menu manipulation remote control 

domain result area study shows adding nl interaction existing graphical interface requires redesign order gain nl flexibility 
consistent findings speech dialogue systems designed scratch directly translated graphical interface 
subjects positive spoken natural language input positive spoken output multimodal interaction sense preferable casual tv context 
users study exploit full potential dialogue system capabilities realize system possessed 
clearly communicate dialogue capabilities system users give relevant feedback entity interaction model suggested applications interactive tv context
