rdf toolkits rdf data consists nodes attached attribute value pairs 
nodes web resources including rdf nodes 
attributes named properties nodes values atomic text strings nodes 
essence rdf model nodes properties values 
addition node centric view rdf model seen directed labeled graphs 
nodes vertices graph properties name edges 
property value think linked edge labeled pointing construction rdf savvy software easier number rdf toolkits appeared offering functionality goes mere parsing

wilbur nokia research center open source toolkit rdf daml written common lisp 
rdf toolkits offers api manipulating rdf data graphs nodes parsing functionality parsers xml encoded rdf daml plain xml written common lisp exist wilbur project started offers simple client api accessing remote urls reason 
wilbur offers frame system api top rdf data api including simple query language 
wilbur strives tight integration rdf data intrinsic features common lisp 
generally wilbur implements rdf data model providing interfaces concrete implementations 
class node represents nodes rdf graph 
node may uri universal resource identifier string associated case consider node named nodes uri called anonymous reader referred discussion uris printed representation 

mapping uri strings nodes provided class dictionary 
system uses single default dictionary named nodes placed 
unique mapping uri strings node instances allows implement strict read print correspondence nodes described 

class triple represents labeled arcs rdf graph 
triple consists subject node instance predicate node instance object node instance string current implementation common lisp object triple associated source node instance designating file url triple originally parsed 

collections triples stored databases instances class db 
upper level api system assumes single default database exposes lower level api database specified explicitly allowing software constructed multiple databases 
simple query functionality provided se wilbur xml parser written common lisp interface similar sax 
parser written rdf needs mind example support dtds entity declarations 
triples database similar find interface stanford rdf api confused wilbur frame query language described 
debugging purposes object inspector macintosh common lisp extended allow easy browsing rdf graphs 

integration issues previous frame systems beef addressed issue integrating object oriented programming frame representation 
beef practical implementations common lisp object system added object oriented programming features frame system approached issue opposite direction object oriented programming language adding features representation common lisp metaobject protocol extend common lisp object system clos 
wilbur frame system api overlaid rdf takes lower level approach integration allowing manipulation rdf graphs 
development may address programming issues beef approach adding programming features frame system approach adding frame features programming language 
wilbur rdf clos integration focuses areas ease common lisp data structures rdf issues input output rdf data common lisp friendly manner common lisp condition mechanism signaling unexpected situations 

reading printing rdf data able rdf data seamlessly interactive common lisp environment data printed representation read back common lisp system 
common lisp defines quality known read print correspondence follows ideally print lisp object read printed representation back obtain identical object 
practice difficult purposes desirable 
reading printed representation produces object obscure technical exceptions equal originally printed object approach called strict read print correspondence non strict common lisp data structures lists strings non strict symbols strict 
wilbur provides strict read print correspondence nodes 
similar bbn daml viewer equal common lisp predicate structural similarity 
uris internally wilbur give unique identity nodes 
order avoid having write read full uris typically long system provides abbreviated syntax idea namespace qualified names xml 
example introduce mapping prefix foo follows foo foo com schema foo bar foo com schema bar xml namespace specification specifically define concatenating expanded form prefix name part wilbur adopts rdf convention turning qualified name single concatenated uri string 
wilbur uses common lisp read macro mechanism incorporate expansion abbreviated uris reader common lisp parser 
expression form foo bar turned instance wilbur node class placed dictionary maps uri strings node instances 
allows nodes embedded common lisp source files enabling embed rdf data compiled binary files 
wilbur uses notion forward node cases abbreviated uri resolved 
missing prefix uri mapping introduced system updates affected nodes resolving uris 
approach similar forward model allowed easily construct circular data structures having worry order named objects introduced 
printing data structures common lisp defines print produces printed representation choose arbitrarily printed representations 
attempts choose readable print object method wilbur node class uses existing prefix uri mapping determine possible abbreviated form node uri subsequently produces printed representation read necessary 
wilbur toolkit separate parsers conforming rdf model syntax specification conforming daml oil description 
rdf parser supports features specification including reification complete descriptions reification individual statements attribute namespace ambiguity 
parser near streaming internally state machine sax parsing events serve transition inputs 
rdf probably supports 
daml parser class daml parser implemented extension rdf parser subclass rdf parser adds support daml collection syntax specified rdf parsetype daml collection 

integrating data structures wilbur frame api quite simple basically offering functions creating frames adding values slot deleting values slot reading slot values 
frames wilbur form graphs slot values frames 
wilbur introduces query language selecting subgraphs graphs words selecting sets nodes rdf graphs 
query expressions patterns expressed regular expressions arc labels slots rdf properties atoms operators pseudo labels sequence operator seq matches sequence steps graph consisting subexpressions en operator seq similar sequence ek match 
disjunction operator matches subexpressions repetition operator rep matches transitive closure subexpression operator rep seq rep 
inverse satisfaction inv requires path defined subexpression matched reverse direction 
container membership atom members match rdf rdf rdf container membership properties 
wildcard atom match label 
wilbur query language similar beef path grammar turn simplification crl path grammar 
root node search start point path query expression wilbur provides functions retrieving reachable node reachable nodes determining path exists specified nodes 
functions easy turn rdf graphs common lisp list structures 
example daml collection constructed dotted pair list properties daml daml rest query expression turn common lisp list seq rep daml rest daml mentioned wilbur daml parser supports daml collection syntax correctly generates dotted pair lists 

dealing unexpected situations common lisp condition system powerful mechanism raising signals unexpected situations encountered 
condition signaled reporting error calling program may choose catch signal allow execution continue point signal raised caught 
wilbur defines rich taxonomy classes various types unexpected conditions takes full advantage condition system ability ignore errors 
illustrates taxonomy note condition classes nox package generated xml parser nox xml error nox pi termination problem nox dtd termination problem nox unexpected tag nox syntax error nox unknown declaration nox unknown character nox malformed url nox feature supported nox missing entity definition nox missing definition nox missing namespace definition feature supported id unknown parsetype illegal character content rdf error container required sequence index duplicate namespace prefix merge general rule errors xml parser signaled non abort parsing errors rdf daml parsers signaled common lisp function allow parsing continue user calling program chooses 
rich taxonomy allows fine grained mapping errors remedial behaviors 

additional features toolkit currently experimental stage 
include rdf serializer capable producing textual xml triple databases schema validator capable checking triple database consistency constraints defined rdf schema specification 
serializer validator extensive query language 
example order find slot value denoted satisfies disjunctive range constraints property denoted query executed seq rdf type rep rdfs subclassof inv rdfs range rep inv rdfs subpropertyof note call determines node reached node path addition rdf daml oil wilbur plug parsers rdf dmoz open directory format alternate rdf syntax
