efficiency questions considered 
background merging architecture section describes networked information retrieval architecture considered 
assumed number search servers search engines available indexes documents document servers 
basic search interaction user client software web browser search server client request form query search server responds ranked list documents 
user may view documents downloading appropriate document servers 
environment large number search servers available possible employ special client known metasearcher lawrence giles gauch selberg etzioni dreilinger howe smeaton 
merge results multiple search servers single ranked list results merging strategy 
addition form query translation technology necessary interact different search servers server selection method may available locating servers covering documents relevant user query 
problems query translation server selection considered 
simple method server selection measure server promise see section 
merging particularly useful single index covers information interest user 
example user wish find information medical treatment searching publicly available medical web site subscription web site proprietary database local intranet local cd rom 
search building single index documents clearly impractical 
metasearcher impression unified index 
merging strategies divided categories voorhees integrated methods isolated methods 
integrated methods require servers provide special information merging isolated merging methods applied specialised merging information servers 
integrated merging methods ordinary retrieval unified collection effective ranking algorithms harman require collection statistics particularly document frequencies 
document frequency number documents containing occurrence term weight relative importance query terms estimate relative probabilities document relevance 
integrated merging strategies special protocols server functionality collate collection statistics allowing comparable document scores generated 
approach collate collection statistics search servers viles french client mazur callan 
case client provides statistics servers query 
cases servers collection statistics homogeneous ranking algorithm generate comparable document scores 
client generates merged ranking sorting documents descending order score 
advantage approach allows servers generate comparable document scores 
disadvantages servers comply statistic propagation protocol non trivial communication take place query time set servers statistics included decided query time 
different approach requires server supply collection information search results gravano kirsch 
client combine collection information individual servers collection information employ ranking algorithm generate merged list 
document information ranking may provided collection statistics obtained downloading documents document servers 
approach requires pre query synchronisation may applied servers support necessary statistic communication protocol 
integrated approaches different definitions collection documents indexed fixed set servers documents indexed servers currently searched
