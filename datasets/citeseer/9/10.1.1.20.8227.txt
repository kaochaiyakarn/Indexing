metadata linking providing conceptual content information attributes web pages important activity enabling search engines provide query results pertinent 
currently concepts usually simple keywords 
hypermedia systems distributed link service may information provide rudimentary conceptual hypermedia clustering documents tag value keyword retrieval purposes linking documents tag value navigation 
keywords effectively classify documents clusters share set keywords variations stemming 
achieve kind diversity association required nontrivial web applications documents need linked dimensions content 
constructing links manually inconsistent error prone 
furthermore chief reasons associating documents contents similar way 
conceptual hypermedia systems chs specify hypertext structure behaviour terms defined conceptual schema 
types documents links includes conceptual domain model describe document content 
consequently information hypertext represented explicitly metadata reasoned example domain model classification structure classify documents documents share metadata deemed similar way 
authoring links documents activity authoring concepts concepts linked associated documents linked 
open hypermedia systems link services common usage web involves embedding links documents html format sense web considered closed hypermedia system 
inherent web infrastructure prevents hypertext links abstracted away documents managed separately example xlink links 
open hypermedia systems links class objects stored managed separately multimedia data documents stored transported cached searched instrumented
