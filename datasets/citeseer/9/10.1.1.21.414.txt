suggest soft security control create secure open systems 
social control means participants responsible security opposed leaving security external global authority 
social mechanisms don deny existence malicious participants 
aiming avoiding interaction 
robust hard security mechanisms passwords reveal bypassed 
describe progress constructing workbench run simulations electronic markets 
examining success di erent security mechanisms avoid maliciously behaving actors hope gain insight create electronic markets 
idea creating reputations participants discussed 
legal aspects social control reputation security mechanisms discussed 
internet going major changes 
shifted noncommercial network scientists universities informal information submitted new security paradigms workshop lake arrowhead ca september 
supported swedish national board industrial technical development 
exchange public network support commercial transactions 
new uses di erent unclear happen extremely open network new context commerce 
having previously considered uninteresting money motivation criminal activities 
salient feature internet open system 
free add components hardware software wishes 
important factors public acceptance net 
internet shopping malls advertising services today closed speci systems probable successful market systems open net 
major problem open systems easy way component components 
hard software originating di erent companies components conceived long conception 
case internet central authority keeps track 
electronic market centralised verifying authority checks certi es human electronic participants non open solution 
look decentralised open mechanisms allow participants market know participants 
done having participants depend central authority accomplished interactions participants 
call family mechanisms social control 
hard security vulnerable nds way 
soft security permits long behaving 
social control soft security approach traditional hard approaches passwords program veri cation access control capabilities hard approaches demand certain components intended provide protection illegal 
unfortunately hard mechanisms fail due unexpected behaviour components 
hackers exploit bugs mail daemon gain access computer 
doesn matter system secure password encryption mechanism possible 
hard security system passed lays open intruder 
soft security expect accept intruders system 
idea identify prevent harming actors 
shall key opens locks system 
social control soft security mechanism 
actor accepted long actions aren harming behaviour changes loose ability act accordingly 
active global open system envision 
think mix human users autonomous computer programs 
terminology actor unimportant human computer program acting reserve term agent computer programs 
di erence system actors system agents allowed function 
pure agent system allow economic mechanisms remove agents system mechanisms devastating real persons 
term agent describe related agent oriented computing 
built simple market simulation workbench available net simplify discovering analysing potential threats open market system possible remedies form mechanisms social control 
sections discuss notion social control describe tool illustrate threat scenarios propose possible remedies ask questions relation law 
related underlying approach view large markets systems interaction participants determines success individual participant 
interesting results drawn game theoretic approaches study systems applied open electronic market systems large markets general 
non cooperative games games non binding commitments study cooperation self interested participants 
interesting idea market oriented programming create design economies walras system described wellman 
model market tool resource allocation argued computational problem transformed resource allocation 
agents means communication trade goods protocol iterated revealing preference functions 
model include unintended malicious collaboration subgroups agents doesn permit side conversations cooperation 
assure convergence resource usage utility sets sub additive 
market oriented programming resource allocation consider market open environment possibly supporting actors malicious intentions goals 
interest study forms social control market economics possible perform computations environments 
idea letting agents answer security system inspired idea mechanism design 
rosenschein zlotkin game theoretic approach design agent communication protocols assuming agent act rationally 
soft security mechanisms intrusion detection tried spa ord 
audit program actions number sensors alert behaviour program unusual trying nd intruders executing programs normally executed users 
similar methods credit card companies try discover fraud searching card owners drastically changes buying behaviour 
attempt detect actors don behave expected 
personal security assistant collects information actions actor trying nd patterns abnormal behaviour actors 
build ne grained reputation system lets actors know abnormal actors 
social control everyday examples think social control examples day world 
opinions numerous things opinions help know act di erent situations 
opinions formed social mechanisms 
ex people live small villages complain feeling watched neighbours 
feel don behave social norm talked back 
don want big city lot crazy people nd awful people live years door door complete stranger 
ects 
small village life governed social control local community 
people leave bike unlocked sure steals 
big city size crowd reduces social control 
person buys bad car prevent people going car dealer big city dishonest dealer continue business regardless clients opinion 
small town soon loose tried 
ects bad 
social pressure conform hinder people want erent things 
artist writer consid ered weird odd locals 
person excluded society having mental illness accepted 
big city possible start new friends base feelings person current behaviour 
ex social mechanism di erent groups develop di erent tastes preferences 
music example 
objective scale measure quality music 
want new record advice people approximately taste friends music reviewers 
classical music hop hop coexist developing quality scale 
fact competing scales develop genre seen plethora reviewing magazines exist example pop music 
summary social control group behaviour indirectly forces group members behave particular way 
social control electronic commerce internet open system big city small village possible act possible way able 
permitted electronic markets large amount fraud con men doing business 
big city know dealing meet rst time 
considered possible negotiate cooperate perform commerce open electronic system way formally knowing intentions actors 
looking market commerce today nd exists informal mechanism ideas absolutely necessary commerce 
notions reputation stability time estimated risk help business 
rst introduce game prisoners 
cast new light issues security large electronic markets 
prisoner dilemma global markets prisoner dilemma name coined tucker famous axelrod non cooperative game prisoners 
prisoner dilemma shows chances prisoners meet low best strategy try cheat prisoner 
interestingly game iterated best choice action cooperate prisoner cooperates 
strategy tit tat evolutionary stable strategy ess 
strategy best strategy player provided players play strategy 
prisoner dilemma tell lot automatic electronic markets 
transaction parties certainly shot deal 
probability business 
means column deny confess row column deny row row column depending 
confess row column confess deny minimize prison time 
gain confess independent confess get year deny 
agents nd game similar prisoner dilemma best game theoretic move try cheat agent 
missing bring system back iterated prisoner dilemma game 
actors electronic market dependent reputation act earlier actions important agents treat exactly iterated prisoner dilemma support cooperation 
form social control put words distributed locally implemented mechanism help achieve cooperation open system prone extremely malicious agents 
mechanisms social control social control way population actors avoid unwanted actors 
consider cooperation mechanisms non cooperative agents 
mechanisms promote cooperation free cooperate agent nd best action 
described shot voting bid mechanism group decision making eliminates advantage trying manipulate result 
risk rational agent chooses cooperate manipulate doesn maximise expected utility 
reducing agent communication vote clark tax lead systems cooperation cient action 
way assure agents act rational non rational agents removed 
computational economies common introduce ctitious currency elimination bad alternatives 
agents paid rationality small fee market non rational agents run money removed market 
cost staying market room sorts actors markets non cooperating malicious just wasting system resources 
system open way making sure prior communication agents clarke tax voting 
agents form collaborating subgroup conspiracy undermine fairness voting 
important mechanisms su cient assure desired behaviour open system 
actors market able refuse cooperate rules game 
reasons doing 
rst trying fraud party 
second acting non rationally incomplete information programmer bug fault system 
safe trust security game theoretic mechanisms assume actors completely rational 
completed way dismiss non rational possibly malicious agents 
way introducing global authority mechanism social control actors 
raises number questions 
possible introduce new agents system 
agent build reputation commit crimes

outline current model market world dimensional surface populated actors buyers sellers 
actors range sight constrained maximum length walls subdividing surface rooms 
actors move randomly step choose business visible actors 
actors move screenshot commerce simulation workbench room see previous room 
seller modeled entity ering service xed price 
service provided seller particular value 
value known buyer deciding doing business 
actor ering service high price low value malicious ine cient 
model 
currently producer produce service avoid side ects caused trade services 
produce service seller pay certain amount money example half value 
remember agent buying service way knowing value service look price 
transaction done value provided service added capital buyer 
actor gets initial capital 
turn simulation actor pay certain price participate 
actor money removed simulation 
number actors xed new actors introduced actor removed 
done making copy actor large capital inserting random world matrix 
running simulations market systems actors di erent methods selecting cooperation partners see methods succeed choosing sellers sellers larger produced value price plus buyer participation cost 
system stabilises population non malicious sellers di erent price categories price correlated value service actors managed auto organise self market buyer choose quality asking simply looking price 
malicious agents money services provide low value 
far studied happens actor pick closest seller cheapest seller sticks favourite seller locally recommended seller 
nd disallowing buyers choose sellers larger number seller agents exist 
furthermore creating regions commerce rooms system able quickly get rid malicious agents 
happens actors regions malicious actors go bankrupt making malicious actors go bankrupt

little migration board buyers nd nice seller range sight 
system nally stabilise population nice sellers terrible cost 
original buyers gone bankrupt 
leads conclude mechanisms arrive nice populations drastic demand elimination lot innocent actors 
electronic market new electronic actors high rate impossible single customer know new actors doing customers possible create new electronic identity old actors reappear new clothes repeating fraud 
large part day day transactions open system largely unknown components possible collect information persons system 
information create computer shadow person purposes ranging directed advertising blackmail 
prevent happening 
electronic agents migrating programs programs possibly unknown origin execute person local computer

remember system open system 
malicious program doesn written spite 
far fetched imagine agent turning computer virus unintended bug 
monopoly everybody sources information actors monopoly quickly established 
leads extremely sensitive systems buyers hands seller change demanded services satis ed competing slightly di erent services ered 
simulation room buyers room reputation top list room nally seller left gone bankrupt 
seller permitted mutate bad seller entire population nally go bankrupt 
avoid monopoly create system di erent di erent valuation measures di erent price levels 
introduce notion location agent system 
costly move place agent promote alternatives close 
allows proliferation di erent sellers di erent regions 
rerun simulation world say rooms sellers room 
don monopoly buyers move room 
seller changes bad behaviour buyers stay go bankrupt ones move survive 
bad seller goes bankrupt new seller introduced 
introducing location sacri ce notion optimal choice rede ne include proximity measure 
di cult accept better alternative monopoly 
mechanism yields low number sellers market 
buyers sensitive seller leaves range sight 
happens random possibly choosing bad seller 
bad seller lot money ord seldom 
remember morris internet worm 
monopoly established everybody choosing algorithm choice global market 
mechanisms social control possible mechanisms social control inspired establishing opinions group members 
local individual distributed trusted third part 
promotion money back don contract 
deposit seller ering money back trusted third part new agent market reputation highly 
agent promote giving money back guarantee leaving money third trusted part 
agent needs initial capital insurance client gradually reputation builds necessary 
value reputation loss reputation cost interest lending money build reputation counting cost pro table deals reputation 
gossip hmm 
don 
expensive 
value value value value value actors spread bad agents 
agent discovered cooperating partner inform agents likewise cheated 
agents gossip 
quickly local market malicious agent 
systems ones gain information large probability competitors gossiping agent agent better lying 
paradox altruistic communication usually ends communication 
question gossip spreads global society unclear 
agents low incentive actors move faster nd new clients 
reputation reviewing introduce actors concerned maintenance reputation charge giving advice choose particular task 
reputation agents money buy services vending agents 
idea similar restaurant critics agents important act 
weren get special treatment unable give correct judgment 
suggested ideal critics reviews buyer large incentive anonymous trust reviews means review list try time 
value value value value reviewer maintains list reputations value nd deals non malicious seller reason prove identity buyers 
won get credit deserves 
reputation cases subjective measure exempli example music 
permitting di erent reputation scales exist compete possible reputation mechanism tool nding categorising information 
variations idea today tried ltering usenet news 
possibly reputation self improving systems reputation corresponds service performed 
actors services perform badly compared gradually replaced services actors better reputation 
security law legal aspects actors information systems investigated 
question raised electronic agents digital identities rights infringement rights client agent acting behalf denied access service 
agents service swedish users 
equal discrimination nationality 
person global internet market crime 
person paid debt nd forever refused service arbitrary grounds 
denial service serious problem automatic reputation systems 
disagreement electronic actors resolved 
krogh proposes agent systems normative legal systems matters settled 
question rules coded system globally enforced 
satisfactory case internet surely ects world outside necessary legal systems di erent countries able 
short need way motivate denial service electronic contracts allow decide 
interesting observation buyer anonymity help preventing kinds discrimination 
actor anonymous way know ethnic group sex nationality client discrimination grounds impossible 
relevance model current market model far optimal 
unclear aspects real markets captures 
notion advertising actors choose move favourite room reputation algorithms choosing somewhat randomly 
production goods strictly additive way sellers bundle di erent goods production advantages lower price product 
discussions people familiar economic market models hopefully help remedy shortcomings 
bankruptcy means regulating market di cult real people interact market electronic agents 
pure electronic systems just way create adaptive systems computing miller drexler computational ecologies huberman systems including real people mechanisms strong 
limiting system include electronic agents parameters modify possible social control mechanisms examined 
hope investigate mixed pure systems 
social control obviously just 
actors excluded rightly wrongly market chances fatal 
continue look kinds problems caused mechanisms 
reputation agents actor looses control information transmits actors 
left reputation agent 
actors better assure information lost ones responsible sending information 
returns problem collecting re ning enormous amounts information available 
markets human markets extended global connectivity change open systems strongly interacting components telecommunication network agent technologies 
large systems put practical everyday sure run 
open systems impossible know sure detailed behaviour components system 
furthermore components added removed time goes global properties open system change rapidly 
parts system permitted interact unpredictable result collective actions 
systems dealing tasks everyday life stable sense adding components system open criminal behaviour permitting new ways safely fraud people 
open internet markets won possible enforce assure certain behaviour actors 
simulating markets interacting agents evolutionary stable strategies means promote rational behaviour agents reward cost execution possible nd strategies giving agent society emergent property global control malicious agents
