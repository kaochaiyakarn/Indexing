privacy severe problem facing pervasive computing 
fundamental question arises gets know personal data stored mobile devices 
current devices access controls user device consider environment privacy aspect 
user limited control personal data offered different locations 
information offered allows generation various profiles device user example location profiles 
improve user privacy propose situation control data published services offered 
comparable normal life identity management allows device different subsets user identity depending perceived context 
users fear privacy invaded collection personal data systems 
privacy context concept restricted ac cess personal data 
pervasive computing devices smart communicate spontaneously privacy 
devices belonging user communicate environment time revealing whereabouts identity user 
scenario illustrates point going shopping mall normally hand personal data person meets 
may choose entering transaction local bank clerk conducting business transaction local retailer peer peer basis visiting trade show 
different aspects personal data handed 
pervasive computing world differentiation publishing personal data devices communicate spontaneously advertise identity irrespective communication partners 
rich proposes principles privacy protection pervasive computing notice choice consent anonymity pseudonymity proximity locality adequate security access recourse 
knowledge practical solution framework pervasive computing takes principles account 
propose identity management concept allows user keep privacy depending situation 
identity management user devices behave similar way user different situations user presents different appearance 
devices controlled identity management change behaviour similar way user 
analogy posited mark weiser build computer systems privacy safeguards real world

identity management information technology systems everybody discloses degree information computer system 
web browsers example allow server obtain user ip address operating system web page previously visited 
server operators personal data generate profiles users

define identity management concept enables user express enforce privacy security needs systems depending situation user 
situation determined context 
user selects subset personal data access granted situation 
communication secure mechanisms enable anonymity confidentiality

early david chaum considered device helps user payment transactions user privacy 
roger clarke proposed digital individual individual data shadow computer system compared user identity defined 
john published report identity help protect user data 
reachability manager realized identity manage ment system telephone reachability 
proposed concept generic identity management usable secure way user protect privacy implemented identity manager internet prototype application 
prototype usable security tool helps inexperienced user manage general security needs web 
actual research identity management emphasis infrastructures needed credentials accountability mechanisms 
identity manager allows user determine personal data offered situation 
set personal data represents user situation constitutes user partial identity 
internet prototype situations specified different urls substrings urls 
situation recognized comparing context pre defined settings rules 
user defined rules derived user actions explicitly choosing particular partial identity situation 
user returns situation system uses identity user knows data offered communication partner 
new undefined situations default identity enables anonymous communication 
technically identity management system anonymity service allows user anonymous communication partner third parties 
trustworthy communication partner identity revealed user selects appropriate partial identity dependent situation 
addition system mechanisms establish confidential communication secure socket layer ssl pgp 
database stores personal data identities situations user 
systems offer parts described functionality 
form fillers automatically fill web forms previously defined personal fake data 
lucent personalized web assistant allows user pseudonymous personalized web sites offering different aliases user 
aliases managed trusted intermediary 
freedom premium service offered anonymizing infrastructure usage pseudonyms web browsing utilize concept identity management internet services 
standard allows user specify preferences privacy preferences 
preferences compared system server policy 
case conflict user system decide conflict solved 
helpful add identity management system identity may contain privacy preferences 
current information publications www iig uni freiburg de www com www freedom net privacy pervasive computing section describe privacy principles langheinrich show identity management helps comply principles 
notice devices carry observe security related actions people concerned informed 
example system configured show log events instantly console window 
case identity management device demand attention user situation arises affects privacy needs user interaction 
situations requiring user interaction pre configured meet demands user concerning security needs minimize disturbance 
conceivable notice may allowed case paid advertisement user determines amount money order reads advertisement 
usability reasons notice kept minimum 
automation compromise usability security disturbance case notice long user 
choice consent stipulated various guidelines data protection sufficient just inform people data collection 
users able actively decide data collected able access data alter erase 
identity management system supports aspect privacy far restricts communication partner access personal data user 
main task identity management system give user control personal data gives away 
consequence system authenticates user explicitly allows pre configured situations arise 
user full control data revealed communication partners 
anonymity pseudonymity data able linked individuals able conceal true identity pseudonyms 
described previous section identity management system default reveals identity user appearance anonymous 
pervasive computing means devices highly mobile case intro duced new anonymity mechanism pervasive identity management 
authentication needed user configure device reveal authentication data defined contexts defined communication partners 
proximity locality proximity locality applied points completely fulfilled 
imagine example public printer archived documents printed 
impossible retrieve data 
database physically near printer authentication location 
show section reachable potential communication partners bound range wireless interface device 
proximity locality may lightweight mechanism cryptographic algorithms due lacking resources incompatibility example limited range wireless transmission ensures weak degree privacy 
adequate security achieve confidentiality information communication technology cryptography classically regarded main mechanism 
cryptographic algorithms frequently longer possible limited system resources new small devices 
security models mainly reconsidered 
identity manager supports cryptography symmetric asymmetric pervasive device capable running cryptographic algorithms key exchange protocols available identity manager auto matically uses encrypted connection 
access recourse alongside principle data data collected specific purpose point emphasizes possibility objection recourse event conflict 
non repudiation mechanisms required
