retrieving information huge data warehouses computerized environments important issue computer science 
networked information systems frequent changes amount type format data problems challenging 
common example information seeking tools search engines world wide web 
users enter keywords user interface text entry fields 
form fill approach requires explicit submission form search engine possible results small set possibly related documents users looking huge set mega hit related probably unrelated documents burdensome browse zero hits 
users wish result query submit 
likes browse huge set documents related needs 
worse case zero hits lead users feeling done wrong indicating spelling mistake lack data causing problem 
network resources time users processing power search engine wasted 
common problem approach interface supposed guide users reasonable result confuses 
takes control away give guidance leads successful result 
research showed improved methods exist efficient querying 
example butterfly system harvest system show efficient querying possible world wide web 
systems attack problem information processing system utilization sides 
navathe address problem relevance results query keyword set propose user interface solution 
dynamic queries direct manipulation approach facilitate query formulation visual representation query components results 
enable rapid incremental reversible control query 
give continuous feedback users guidance query formulation 
shows example dynamic query interface 
application dynamic querying networked querying environments useful 
hand high system resource demands dynamic querying applicable huge networked information warehouses 
solution problem uses data aggregation tandem dynamic queries 
solution problem division bigger problem smaller problems query previews overviews 
paradigm give overview database users details visualized 
overview enable users see necessary detail order final query understand distribution data database 
querying process divided steps reduce resources needed form final query 
multi phase incremental querying process hopefully lead desired results resources time 
dynamic query interfaces implemented nasa global change master directory web site process public 

phase querying phase approach designer chooses discriminating attributes database design direct manipulation user interface 
rest attributes kept second phase include discriminating attributes 
querying environment activated interface query preview appears immediately 
users decisions interface move second query refinement complete query 

query preview query preview powerful tool define rough ranges data set explored 
shows discriminating attributes database selection lead smaller subset database 
consumes modest system resources small number attributes database phase 
guide users query formulation process preview supplied aggregate information database possible number hits query formed 
distribution data attribute values shown pie bar chart 
users select value attributes preview panel rest user interface bars updated second 
called tight coupling 
action users take feedback 
users see potential size query result refining rough ranges chance get zero mega hits 
system load drop drastically users don waste time zero hit queries consume network resources downloading useless results 
greatest advantage query preview users need download aggregate information data distribution phase 
database size distribution information data needed form preview decreasing system resource demands 
example query preview 
major attributes database chosen query preview 
distribution data attributes shown bars possible result set size displayed bar bottom part interface 

query refinement query refinement phase works query preview inherits constraints data set sent phase 
phase easily implemented dynamic query interface browse remaining data 
desired result set obtained saved 
data collection documents values set pictures refinement phase phase querying 
similar approach third phase added phases picture databases tool analyze picture detail 
shows sample query refinement implemented dynamic querying paradigms 
attributes sample data set displayed dynamic query interface 
initial query specified query preview refined level just selecting desired values attributes database 

user study query preview interfaces add phase query formulation possibility user performance deteriorate annoyed twophase approach 
study analyzed effects query preview user performance preference 
believe query previewing guides users forming query 
helps narrow huge search space manageable size giving information distribution data 
better control study done non networked environment advantage query previews greater networked environment due additional delays downloading process
