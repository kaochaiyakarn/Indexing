portable information access pia collier project aims develop domain language portable information extraction system

relation muc ne guidelines proceeding take care note aim provide criticism build important started 
purposes pia felt muc guidelines required revision extension main reasons outline 
firstly want allow markup terminological expressions internal structure syntactic semantic requires explicit disambiguation original guidelines focused mainly names people organizations provide arbitrary fixes issue felt improved 
secondly due developments semantic content annotation motivated semantic web berners lee want develop annotation scheme conform model link instances concepts texts concept taxonomy part ontology goals pia help users access textual information collections online semantic web model represent ontology rdf 
nes considered instances concepts encoded rdf 
second reason important allows concept classes instances explicit relations properties reasoned axioms 
separating annotation data base document ensure software creates annotations edit base document ensuring integrity 
third reason felt necessary clear distinction annotated annotated 
words want encourage annotators think content documents surface forms names technical terms 
aim guidelines focus mainly helping annotators map surface forms terms interested call conventional forms 
know advance classes information needed particular domain attempt guidelines 
hopefully clearer section 
pia extend meaning ne include terminological expressions recognized agreed community domain users 
follow broad definition term de lexical unit consisting words represents concept domain 
decided note pia guidelines allow users annotate nested structures require flat style annotation permissible user feels required 
noted scheme allows multiple ontologies annotation files created single base document documents may quite natural due various user groups requiring different levels detail annotation 
ensures data integrity type semantic modularization 
example consider document describing discovery new planet news domain may want know name planet discover astronomy domain may want know specific details primary star orbit chemical composition 
keep label ne familiarity research community 
candidates inclusion ne expressions proper nouns names people places temporal expressions days week dates quantity definitions names monetary values names stock market indices terminological expressions certain expressions share identity 
ne belong categories expression mentioned belong class appears domain ontology 
pia reconsider roles named entity coreference expressions muc 
muc tasks considered somewhat independently results assumed merged template element task higher level task 
pia merge tasks lower level define class type named entities meaning inferred surface form second class type named entities anaphoric expressions depend type named entity meaning 
annotate terminological expressions 
basically domains strong tendency certain expressions technical terms re expressions creation new technical terms 
vocabulary domain consistent predictable extent 
hypothesis sufficient examples terms meaning explicitly annotated domain experts computers trained recognize meaning unseen terms domain partially understand meaning text 
muc systems perform ne task produce single unambiguous output close possible produced human expert domain 
issues consider identification boundaries ne second classification text inside boundaries concept classes available ontology 
guidelines muc prescribe particular set concept classes 
chosen consensus community domain users 
concentrate graphical syntactic issues expressions boundaries ne ambiguous basic form call conventional form different surface form hope presenting guidelines way applicable domains 
current guidelines provide support english japanese 
partial support expected follow soon thai arabic 
users languages hoped underlying principals provide ontology conventional forms rdf enable guidelines extended languages 
cases interested extending revising guidelines meet requirements user community welcome comments feedback
