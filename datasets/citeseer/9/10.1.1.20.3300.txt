trust formation process establishing initial trustworthiness collaborator referred trust formation 
summary entity trustworthiness synthesized history past interactions entities allocating privileges specific risks 
evidence relevant current context carry weight 
initially new entities evidence past behaviour establish base interaction 
form opinion trustworthiness case requires presence optimistic entities willing take risks unknown situations allocating privileges judiciously experience shows unwise 
trust evolution evolution process regarded iterating process trust formation additional evidence available 
accumulation evidence experience new interactions modify level trust placed entity incrementing summary information maintain accuracy 
risk assessment entity performing action particular context change depending known positively negatively perceived actions past 
successful high risk interaction results greater increase trust successful low risk interaction 
conversely lower level risk greater penalty failed interaction 
granularity evolution seen necessary byzantine behaviour considered 
reason failure may important fact failure occurred 
people alter level trust radically failure intentional malicious accidental 
historical information patterns previous behaviour may analysed help determine reason failure 
evidence outcome interactions may dishonest sources requiring measures place modify reputation certificate collaborators cases framing collusion 
trust exploitation essential problem exploitation determine behaviour basis trust balances risk benefit context appropriately 
security policy access control expressed terms trust specifies level positive experiences required allow access specific resource 
policy determine entity optimistic pessimistic interaction depending risks involved 
status open issues part secure project initial formal trust model developed addresses issues arise trust part security mechanism representation trust recorded evidence 
model help determine exactly importance context lies constitutes context context awareness achieved 
similarly model developed lead better understanding risk estimated mechanisms provide privileges trust
