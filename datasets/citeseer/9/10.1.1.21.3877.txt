research www currently strives augment syntactic information web semantic metadata order achieve semantic web human software agents alike understand 
rdf daml oil languages advanced basis extending purely syntactic information html documents semantics 
advancements urgent challenges knowledge capturing problem viz 
may turn existing syntactic resources interlinked knowledge structures represent relevant underlying information 
framework facing challenge called cream implementation ont mat 
origin facing challenge dates back start seminal ka initiative providing semantic markup html pages knowledge acquisition community 
basic idea manual knowledge markup web pages error prone replaced simple tool help avoid syntactic mistakes 
developing cream framework recognize knowledge capturing task exhibited intrinsic difficulties solved simple tool 
mention challenges immediately came ka setting consistency semantic structures adhere ontology order allow better sharing knowledge 
example avoided people confuse complex instances attribute types 
proper identifiers instances persons institutes companies unique 
instance ka metadata existed different identifiers colleague dieter fensel 
knowledge grasped straightforward query 
avoid redundancy decentralized knowledge provisioning possible 
annotators collaborate possible identify parts sources annotated reuse previously captured knowledge order avoid laborious redundant annotations 
relational metadata html information spread web related html links knowledge markup may distributed semantically related 
current annotation tools tend generate template metadata hardly connected 
example annotation environments support dublin core providing means state name authors ids maintenance knowledge markup needs maintained 
annotation tool support maintenance task

furthermore ontology important order guide annotators creating relational metadata 
done preliminary experiments subjects problems creating relationship instances creating attribute instances cf 

ontology cues assigning relationships class instances
