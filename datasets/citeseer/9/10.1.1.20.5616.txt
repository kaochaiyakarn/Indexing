long ago arithmetic quickly hand little slow doing simple finding square root pencil 
find hard program machine code wearable computer system help assembler compiler 
freeing mundane tasks arithmetic hand assembly computer instructions lets think higher level 
tools pocket calculators assemblers compilers greatly extended capabilities enabling develop new set higher level abilities 
probably develop dependence readily accessible computing just developed dependence wash wear clothing desktop computers matter 
fact primitive societies survive quite clothing probably lost ability survive naked wilderness doesn support argument clothing 
someday accustomed clothing computing doubt feel naked confused lost computer screen hovering front eyes guide 
time fortunately increased reliability important part design 
just want shirt buttons pop fall demand computer clothing go 
past prototypes cumbersome prototypes remain somewhat obtrusive miniaturization continues pack greater level functionality smaller space 
enabling apparatus soon invisible disappears ordinary clothing 
efforts produce wearable computers commercially 
commercial interest bound add impetus miniaturization 
rough prototypes getting small eye movements indication wearer may online 
eye movements reading virtual image appear somewhat unusual apparatus invisible 
development commercialization natural looking systems overcome initial reluctance potential users gradually create broader user base just powerful easier pcs way offices homes 
clothing computing personal imaging blur boundaries seeing viewing remembering recording 
narrowing focus living personal information domain enlarge scope shared visual memory enables remember seen 
computers close shirts backs interaction natural 
improve ability traditional computing tasks standing walking letting computing systems function second brain 
computer constantly attentive environment may develop situational awareness perceptual intelligence ability see wearer perspective assist day day activities 
course far reaching goals require years research
