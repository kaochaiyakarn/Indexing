method searching scanning vs searching 
method searching describes user system searching implies user looking particular piece information scanning implies user browsing scanning item interest 

mode retrieval recognition vs specification 
mode retrieval describes user searching specification query description need recognition recognising item relevant describing relevant 

goal retrieval learning vs selection
