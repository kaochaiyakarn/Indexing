steven pinker writes accompanying news story shows evolvability striking features language compositionality 
appreciate major contributions books papers observe shortcomings proposed theories 
verbal mathematical accounts tend overlook crucial details 
verbal theories underestimate intricacies evolutionary dynamics take evolution general problem solver 
mathematical models crucial simpli cations linguistically poorly motivated 
particular types theories shown little appreciation importance frequency dependency language evolution role selforganization
