relevance feedback personalization language modeling perspective bruce croft stephen townsend victor lavrenko computer science department university massachusetts amherst ma croft lavrenko cs umass edu approaches personalization involve learning short term long term user models 
user models provide context queries interactions information system 
discuss language models represent context support context techniques relevance feedback query disambiguation 

overview perspectives personalization studied information retrieval time 
goal personalization improve effectiveness information access adapting individual users needs techniques relevance feedback filtering certainly considered support personalization 
considerable research done user modeling information retrieval 
research essentially goal current research personalization build model user interests preferences time 
filtering systems emphasize learning user interest profile profiles time 
relevance feedback hand goal learning model user interest single search session 
short term personalization 
starting query users different documents answers depending feedback 
put way system uses user feedback learn specific context mind initial query 
query expansion local feedback techniques related personalization context 
user query document corpus possible contexts query inferred suggest additional query terms 
true personalization long term profile user model choose contexts additional query terms individual user believe representation context inferred basic component approach content personalization 
studying issues short term single session may learn handle context effectively long term multiple sessions 
relevance feedback despite long history information retrieval research successfully adopted web search engines 
closest feature search engines find documents 
query expansion techniques number systems suggest additional search terms limited success 
number reasons apparent failure relevance feedback current systems 
primary usually mentioned difficulty getting users provide relevance information 
simply providing relevant relevant buttons interface provide incentive user 
reason number researchers investigating techniques infer relevance passive measures time spent browsing page number links followed page 
relevance information provided significant problem current feedback techniques 
full text limited relevance information relevance feedback techniques developed simply reliable experiments collections abstracts indicated 
words identifying correct context simple 
experiments shown user indicate relevant sections phrases document relevance feedback accurate 
imply need input users 
summary relevance feedback query expansion personalization techniques attempt infer context user query top ranked documents additional feedback 
successful application relevance feedback easy involves sophisticated interface design algorithms inferring context 
focus algorithms inferring context 
particular describe language modeling approach problem lead new perspectives relevance feedback query ambiguity 

relevance feedback language models number formal ways describing relevance feedback notion optimal query smart system salton 
optimal query defined vector obtained difference relevant non relevant sets documents represented vectors 
query vector shown best assumptions distinguishing relevant non relevant documents 
relevance feedback approach evolved query modification process old query modified weighted average identified relevant documents versions algorithm identified non relevant documents 
revised query produce new document ranking 
common way describing relevance feedback bayesian classification model retrieval van rijsbergen 
approach identified relevant documents estimate characteristics probabilities occurrences words relevant class documents query 
corpus estimate probabilities non relevant class 
revised estimates produce new document ranking probability belonging relevant class 
approaches viewed applications different machine learning techniques problem identifying relevant documents training data

language model approach feedback appear lend relevance feedback 
basic approach suggested ponte croft document represented document language model 
query treated sample text language model documents ranked probability document language model generate query text 
simple model produces surprisingly retrieval results model extended variety ways 
example documents modeled mixtures topics hoffman translation probabilities introduced deal synonymy cross lingual retrieval berger lafferty

ponte simply adds additional words query log ratio probability occurrence model relevant documents probability collection 
model relevant documents taken sum individual document models 
miller words relevant documents added query probabilities model adjusted training queries 
approaches produced results satisfactory models point view describing defining query contexts user models central personalization 
order better capture important processes relevance feedback query expansion believe important view query sample text model information need 
documents generated document language models associated authors queries generated information need language models associated individual users 
raises interesting possibility users documents represented mixture topic language models generated previous interactions sources

quantifying ambiguity queries information retrieval system ambiguous 
context query clear 
example query web search java context programming languages indonesia coffee possibly 
query way ambiguity resolved ask user clarification form 
thousands documents java programming fewer indonesia relying relevance feedback resolve problem unrealistic 
better method determine query ambiguous ask user specific questions resolve ambiguity 
part addressing query ambiguity define quantify 
currently developing language model framework 
approach assigns clarity value query different associated language model corpus language model 
clarity non negative number zero assigned maximally vague query associated language model indistinguishable corpus language model 
example word query apple get low clarity score general news database associated language partly related apple pies partly related new york city big apple partly related apple computer assuming capitalization ignored 
query apple computer receive significantly higher score collection associated language specialized blurred competing meanings apple pie new york city 
collection articles consisting solely technology news queries apple apple computer similar clarity scores 
current efforts unigram language models probability distributions terms 
model language associated query model collection define clarity kullback liebler kl divergence collection distribution query distribution clarity log vocabulary set terms occurring collection 
preference symmetrically related quantity accurately estimated 
interpreted terms coding theory clarity average number bits wasted encoding word events collection model code optimally designed query model 
main ingredient computing numerical values clarity query language model 
types language models refer probability weighted models relevance models 
probability weighted approach language model query taken query interpreted song croft set retrieved documents probability query generated specific document model 
bayesian inversion uniform document priors 
individual document models estimated fixed parameter linear smoothing corpus model pml pml simply maximum likelihood probability estimate computed number occurrences term document divided number terms document estimated relative frequency term corpus 

equation efficiently calculated replacing distribution approximation uses fixed number documents entire retrieved set 
histogram formed sampling adding corresponding bin long non zero bins 
soon th unique document sampled process stopped histogram normalized form approximate distribution place 
value empirically give accurate results compared entire retrieved set variance roughly 
guarantees system mix documents computation resulting large performance gains particularly large collections
