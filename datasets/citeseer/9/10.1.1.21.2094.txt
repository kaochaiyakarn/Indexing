implementable algorithms satisfiability problems logics polynomially reducible satisfiability problems variable fragments order temporal logics 
seen usually fragments decidable 
question supported practical decision procedures 
idea take advantage fact variable fragments temporal logics embeddable monadic second order logic case fca fsa weak monadic second order logic may hodkinson provers mona see klarlund 
unfortunately translation hodkinson exponential prover job harder 
hand tableau decision procedure variable fragment order temporal logic hn developed lutz combination wolper tableau pt standard tableau variable fragment order logic 
currently similar tableau procedure implemented temporal description logic expect significant experimental results efficiency procedure shortly 
positive results allow construction practical system language st interpreted tt models hn possibly infinite topological spaces 
open door implementation decision procedure st models hn finite topological spaces 
extensions obtained results steps study effective spatiotemporal formalisms 
interesting problems remain open investigation 
instance interesting practically important extend spatio temporal logics constructors allowing speak orientation say go west change distances 
hand need constructors represent properties regions different purely spatial temporal region tourist attraction accessible plane 
promising idea combine spatio temporal logics suitable description logics see haarslev combination description logic metric logic proposed kutz interesting problem find expressive decidable fragments rcc 
example consider datalog type language built basic spatial predicates 
compose knowledge bases euro zone euro zone ec pp europe germany euro zone ec germany poland pp poland europe ec poland russia russia asia ec europe asia answer query poland euro zone answer russia euro zone 
language extended boolean region terms 
till imposed restrictions form spatial regions 
applications gis may require consider euclidean space interpret regions figures special form say circles polygons grigni open problem satisfiability problem rcc formulas interpretations decidable 
similar question asked regarding brcc spatio temporal logics constructed 
halpern shoham introduced modal logic intervals modal operators correspond thirteen relations allen interval logic see section 
construct similar modal logic regions modal operators form 
intended meaning modalities follows 
suppose topological model form region holds region tpp holds interesting research problem investigate computational behavior logic different classes topological models
