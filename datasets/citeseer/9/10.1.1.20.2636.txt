introducing scholonto web facilitated access scholarly documents making available copies papers technical reports digital libraries individuals home pages 
reasonable keyword access provided web search engines

semantic web approach augmenting web documents machine understandable information offers potential means addressing need 
scholarly ontologies scholonto project takes approach 
developing ontology claims server augment existing papers modelling authors readers interpretations 
produces claim space raw digital libraries effectively semantic web inter linked concepts 
system enables researchers claims concerning view document contributions relationship literature 
claims may support contest existing claims contrast semantic web applications scholonto require consensus 
semantic structure claim space provides basis making queries interpretation research papers just keywords citations 
consider example apparently simple question requires interpretation multiple documents specific way possible plain citations arguments intellectual framework builds 
show building semantic network claims distributed document collection start answer questions 
ontology rhetorical relations take position authors discussing domain nature research flux discourse conducted stable 
consequently conceptual glue scholonto links ideas reified ontology rhetorical relations 
claim triple assertion particular relationship holds ideas 
relations ontology act attributes triples object value concept set data

data visualisation increasingly important

making list claims easy lose track shape argument relates parts network 
users need able see connections claims create 
investigating ways extract claims papers semiautomatically suggest semantic links way easing claim acquisition bottleneck 
claims server implementation described provides controllable centralised environment test ideas 
agent approach offers exciting alternatives 
distributed scholonto authors interpretations papers published alongside originals
