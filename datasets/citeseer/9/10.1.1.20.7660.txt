harald distributed systems group computer science department university hamburg germany tel mail harald de keywords hypertext navigation links typed links usability prof dr lamersdorf distributed systems group computer science department university hamburg germany tel mail informatik uni hamburg de discusses methods generate display automatically additional hyperlink information users world wide web 
current web browsers hard predict happen link followed users get different information expect new window may opened download starts destination object just available 
giving appropriate notification advance users follow link check document contains expected information get back try link usually possible obtain additional hyperlink information sources link anchor tags user history web servers 
furthermore little enhancements web servers may include additional information hyperlinks web documents 
displayed users select link improve navigation reduce cognitive overhead 
types web hyperlink information listed potential methods facts compared prototype implementation proposed concept called developments discussed 
new users world wide web usually impressed amount richness contents accessible web 
soon unfortunately discover finding right information challenging task search engines hyperlinks lead information expect 
tremendous number documents reasons usability problems web 
nielsen discovered field study users lose orientation small hypertext system orientation clues pp 

reasons identified users know way choose 
hypertext systems web seen space readers move directly place 
concepts orientation navigation refer travel metaphor 
real world getting overview hyperspace nearly impossible object displayed time small part space 
furthermore hyperlinks carry information predict referenced object demanding select right way 
cognitive overhead associated choosing follow link long realized 
regarding hypertext navigation conklin pp 
characterized cognitive overhead additional effort concentration necessary maintain tasks trails time 
different solutions suggested reduce cognitive overhead 
key aspects solutions tools allow overview hyperspace enhancement link capabilities 
hypertext systems provide additional hyperlink overview maps guide system extra hierarchy browser structural navigation client harmony 
unfortunately web clients 
fact concept web inherently provide kind structural information filesystem folder structure represented url 
links embedded html documents extracted create overview maps 
local overviews possible tools available comparable global navigation tools supported 
second solution reduce cognitive overhead hypertext navigation improve substance links 
hypertext systems enforce author set link type add link titles 
information shown user selects link get precise impression referenced document 
fact html supports link types titles hardly author uses 
main reason shortcoming probably poor support features web browsers editors 
hypertext research show setting link types easy 
discovered wang rada year field study users hypertext system 
writing documents setting hyperlinks users rarely bothered select link types assigned link names default ones 
link type chosen choice inconsistent way authors categorize link 
result recommended specifying link type easy possible 
concept web usage studies catledge pitkow tauscher greenberg indicate half navigation actions users open url events :10.1.1.25.8958
gvu survey indicates users see hyperlinks web pages important way find new www pages 
findings show links web important navigation facility 
user interface hyperlinks quite information user gets link destination link anchor text referenced url displayed status bar browsers netscape communicator microsoft internet explorer 
usability studies spool bore web links usually sufficient user predict referenced document 
especially embedded hyperlinks words long generic 
users certain link choose links displayed separate line explained extra description 
rarely available 
missing link information consequence users try help interpreting additional information url 
noticed thinking aloud tests campus wide information system experienced users learn interpret information included url 
apparent users comments url important element users orientation navigation actions 
study people link selections conducted procter 
confirmed users forced fall back heuristics drawn past experience interpret url selecting link 
address predict different aspects referenced object contents expected download time destination web site 
method cognitive psychology software evaluation lewis 
readability urls humans poor primarily technical addresses 
particularly experienced users unable understand urls know interpret different parts 
consequently projects aim urls avoidable service maps key phrases web pages 
location web object defined url obsolete near 
try important providing user better link interface 
want urls considerable meaningful information provided 
hypertext research show authors problems adding useful information hyperlinks web rarely offered see 
reasonable display piece information users available extracted automatically 
sources browser give web links additional information 
link anchors referenced urls 
experienced users know interpret urls browser decode data legible way 
reduce cognitive overhead avoid need users observe address status bar looking information web 
source user history 
maintaining considerably comprehensive log user visited documents offering better history tools retrieving information easier 
user history integrated seamlessly navigation 
facts visit web page title document displayed link 
fourth source additional hyperlink information web servers 
regularly gathering information local directly referenced external documents database information add new attributes link tags 
user interface links hardly changed versions ncsa mosaic users complain significant problems finding things web big potential improvements give users help 
try go step direction tool 
methods display additional link information determine display additional link information appropriately compared different methods introduced earlier hypertext systems 
paragraph give short survey promising ways supplementary link type data 
overview map hypertext systems typed links display link information labels overview diagram hyperspace 
labels appear arrow representing link 
advantage method improved overview structure document relations 
user wants consider information keep areas view overview map needs certain additional screen space 
www com 
internet keyword concept integrated search engines browsers microsoft internet explorer 
reserved area popular web browsers display referenced url link browser status bar bottom window 
uses screen line show short description cursor touches hyperlink 
system shall put link information view single line text extra window frame 
example hypermedia version papers august issue communications acm displays additional link data extra frame 
placing comment far away associated anchor difficult compare 
forces reader large visual saccades order read comment return anchor text 
links web links provide short supplementary information anchor text 
web design guidelines recommend links objects considerable properties 
instance authors put size referenced object brackets link file reasonably big 
possible small icons envision kinds link types 
adding kind data browser navigation tool automatically cause problems web documents little changes mess layout page 
web browser tool traffic lights adds little colored bars link anchor demonstrates 
link color graphical web browser mosaic different colors link anchor text distinguish links unknown documents links visited documents 
client harmony additionally utilizes different anchor text background colors multiple link destinations anchor visible 
color link important navigation aid web users 
unfortunately complexity number displayed link properties quite low 
furthermore text link anchors requires web designers change standard colors documents 
mouse pointer method different link attributes apparent utilizing different mouse pointers 
pointer changes link type moved link 
example guide system uses method 
method allows display link attributes instantly pointer hovers link 
completely independent screen layout different mouse pointers may interesting option web clients 
drawback complexity displayed properties limited text may displayed 
popup small floating windows appear mouse cursor moved active object 
versions microsoft internet explorer display title attribute anchor tags little popup 
jakob nielsen strongly recommends titles enhancements web help people navigate opposed simply making pages look fancy 
unfortunately rarely 
popup information current gui systems 
instance appear mouse pointer floats icons control elements 
quite common users 
known disadvantage cover important information obstruct objects near link anchor 
problem reduced letting appear demand user points mouse active object certain time 
chose method project order display additional link information 
best applicable web appear advantageous 
particular interfere page layout image maps hold links graphic 
furthermore appear focus attention show flexible amount information 
characteristics hyperlinks www view web hyperlinks simple compared typed links hypertext systems 
looking closer new features web challenging hyperdocuments 
additional aspects regarding web links may identified local versus external link 
furthermore lot unexpected things happen user clicks link www clients incorporate different protocols news ftp links control contents frames windows user may requested write mail 
occurs users return pages visited remember actions 
section describes important characteristics web hyperlinks explains information think hidden users 
semantics link documents sets semantic relationship 
web authors try express relationship give impression target selecting appropriate link anchor text graphic 
cases sufficient 
semantic information link titles link types introduced 
th ring haake list semantic link information principle useful hypermedia system design 
html additional anchor attributes defined express relationship source destination precisely 
web authors set link title attributes rel rev set forward backward relationship type 
html identifies relationship types useful contents subsection alternate 
approach prospective xlink similar html attributes hardly considered today browsers 
latest versions internet explorer display link title popup window 
attributes applied authors semantic information target document title author useful source 
information extracted user history transferred server shown 
navigation direction direction essential aspect hypertext navigation 
user view distinguished forward backward navigation 
forward navigation occurs user looking new information backward navigation occurs tries regain information obtained 
important tool backward navigation back button followed bookmarks called favourites hotlist history 
aspect backward navigation revisit web pages 
weeks study users tauscher greenberg pages individual visits pages visited 
statistics believe web browsers regard user history better active navigation 
contemporary web browsers consider user link page user visited 
bookmarked url 
history unsatisfactory way links change color links pages seen user blue links previously seen pages purple 
appropriate web browser 
today link anchors graphics information displayed 
cases web authors change link colors design purposes 
done users see exactly visited destination object 
furthermore link color returns blue certain time 
bookmarks aspect backward navigation considered 
user see bookmark document link leads page bookmark 
seeing users bookmarks aware 
displaying information gathered user history want seamlessly integrate user navigation direction active web operation 
access time system response time crucial factor usability interactive systems 
user studies hypertext systems system carnegie mellon university indicated maximum response time exceeded pp 

unfortunately comparable response time guaranteed web user 
access time different web objects varies quite lot 
johnson argued value information dependent access time usability test showed lot users quit transfer return object download takes long 
slow access time interrupts user task solving process leads cognitive burden lower productivity 
predictability system response time link help users choose may worth follow link 
mentioned web browser tool traffic lights uses small red yellow green bars link anchors give user idea anticipated transfer time 
estimated requesting head referenced server homepage 
user evaluation showed concept beneficial users helped find suitable documents topic quickly 
unfortunately access time web object really predicted quality service support current tcp ip implementation 
big file size slow server response give impression probable response speed displayed user 
link large pdf file type referenced object html primary language documents web hyperlinks may lead documents formats 
graphics adobe acrobat documents vrml worlds xml documents selection 
types provide hyperlinks require special plug viewer 
apparently set hurdles user 
web design guidelines advise visible user 
followed 
fortunately document type extracted extension referenced object 
web browsers fracture navigation clear 
users look url status bar learn lot different file types 
link action regarding web hyperlinks behave different ways 
frequent ones replacement links destination document replaces source object 
links lead position web document pp 

information extracted experienced user link url web links lead unpredictable actions 
links open new browser window control contents frame start new client mail program 
link actions defined precisely xlink new attributes show presentation characteristics defined 
design guidelines recommend aspects apparent link anchor 
web authors follow recommendations 
anyway standard 
information extracted just analyzing parameters anchor tag common browser
