discussion concluding remarks analysis far shown approaches usually applied ow management systems activity communication provide adequate vehicles process modelling aim ort reengineer streamline processes aiming operational improvement 
approaches falls concerning scope wealth information provided 
speci cally provide ample information concerning tasks modelled separating phases tasks activities rich information time duration processes cost incurred execution processes constructs modelling issues parallelism mechanisms 
approaches number di erences concerning modelling taken explicitly account strongly related limitations general ow systems 
list basic ones observed modelling procedure constitute main scope methodological rigour implied approach possibility formally specifying provable mathematical constructs correctness approach 
point clearly di erentiate approaches di erent philosophies underlying 
communication approach implicitly underlying model described thoroughly winograd flores activity lack strong mathematical construct 
observation relates general limitation ow modelling lack rigorous modelling 
orts ows analytically took place meta graphs distributed computational modelling techniques see weske basu 
concluding obviously approach easily formalised context analytical essays activity oriented analytical techniques 
simplicity complexity applying approaches especially regard ow communication interdependence tasks 
methods highly dependent type process 
key issue activity approach enables observe possible interdependencies tasks provide information ow communication processing entities weske 
contrary brought successfully communication approach turn due structure represent large number interdependent tasks 
ease applying approaches de ned repetitive processes 
hard di erent reasons approach model exceptional tasks processes 
tasks excluded due uncertainty time processing entities involved 
international journal information management ability ease approach handling client orientation 
activity approach convenient automating internal tasks organisation communication strongly focuses relationship customer reminding single step client expecting task 
managerial implications concerning expertise required approach 
activity techniques structured require process modelling expertise project management team 
hand communication technique structured guides adequate degree conceptually model designer modelling procedure 
disadvantage restricts degrees freedom design team 
case exist activity approach enables modelling complex models 
addition mentioned issues remarks ow modelling point possible research directions 
ow representation techniques include uncertainty handling modelling 
recall process implementation uncertainty drives big delays see adler nguyen 
time duration usually represented deterministic way enabling involving possible knowledge uncertainty 
interesting incorporate probabilistic views couple properties ow systems directing ow information appropriate processes
