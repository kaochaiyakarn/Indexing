main problem isa overloading ontologies centered taxonomy partial ordering relation named various ways isa subsumption hyponymy 
taxonomy main backbone ontology fleshed addition attributes relations nodes meronymy antonymy 
usual shall generically call isa main taxonomic relation confused instanceof links node class belongs partial order 
problem isa considering linguistic ontologies wordnet intended lexical relation words reflects ontological relation classes entities world 
fact known tendency confuse aspects quite high especially linguistic ontologies non linguistic applications 
instance common praxis linguistic ontologies rely multiple inheritance represent polysemy 
results overloading role isa links shall see may cause serious semantic problems 
eliminate problems solution propose pay attention ontological implications taxonomic choices limiting isa links connect nodes sharing similar identity criteria 
way taxonomy reflects basic ontological structure clear semantics extra information currently encoded isa links represented means specialized links attributes 
report examples consider isa overloading confusion senses window artifact place reduction sense physical object amount matter association group wordnet person physical object living thing communicative event physical mental social event penman overgeneralization place physical object wordnet amount matter physical object wordnet suspect type role link person living thing causal agent wordnet apple fruit food wordnet confusion taxonomic roles taxonomy qualities penman separable entity classes examples represent different kinds ontological misconceptions discussed turn 
confusion senses 
example reported shows case different senses word collapsed single class inheriting multiple superclasses 
wordnet different synsets associated term window subsumed opening panel 
choice multiple inheritance handle polysemy may appear economical sight presents obvious ontological entity panel opening 
cleaner solution represent senses disjoint concepts expressing intrinsic links existing means extra relations 
instance opening needs exist order window function properly 
interesting compare wordnet amount matter physical object 
reduction sense 
case isa link points aspect meaning concept fully account identity physical object just amount matter association group people person physical object 
case fact persons special physical objects represented extra link living thing problem analogous previous case difference clear order senses represented means multiple inheritance body sense basic living sense living depends constituted body 
example fig 
different senses collapsed communicative event just physical event extra properties 
overgeneralization 
case single category includes categories different nature weakening meaning 
instance wordnet gloss physical object physical tangible visible entity full balls objects contradict examples reported place tangible ii amount matter uncountable category statement reported gloss refers countable notion physical object 
choices force weaker interpretation physical object 
suspect type role link 
disturbing examples reported person necessarily living thing plays role causal agent involved certain events 
analogously apple necessarily fruit food 
shall see person apple types causal agent food roles 
basis ontological analysis shall bring reason forbidding links 
confusion organizational roles 
source troubles serious previous ones affects organization tendency express unary properties certain class entities terms superclasses inherit 
take instance hierarchy qualities penman upper level inherited various formal properties qualities polarity correspond nodes ontology course gets quite tangled 
problem distinction nodes carrying major organizational role taxonomy simply express particular property 
example node decomposable object penman subsumes number different classes generating high degree 
suggestion avoid including nodes taxonomy relying attributes express properties 
words unary properties need expressed means isa links 
examples refer cases polysemy represented means isa links
