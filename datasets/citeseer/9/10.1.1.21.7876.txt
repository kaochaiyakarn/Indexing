broadest level think hippocampus exists part provide memory system learn arbitrary information rapidly suffering undue amounts interference 
memory system sits top works conjunction neocortex learns slowly experiences producing integrative representations relevant statistical features environment 
hippocampus accomplishes rapid relatively interference free learning relatively non overlapping pattern separated representations 
pattern separation occurs result sparseness hippocampal representations relative cortical representations fact hippocampal units sensitive conjunctions cortical features cortical patterns feature overlap probability particular conjunction features patterns 
propose hippocampus produces relatively high threshold high quality response test items 
response high threshold sense studied items trigger rich recollection defined retrieval test probe features memory trigger rich recollection 
response high quality sense time recollection signal consists part single studied pattern opposed blend studied patterns 
high quality nature recollection explained terms hippocampal representations insofar recollection function features test probe encountered study contain novel feature conjunctions constituent features familiar trigger rich recollection insofar hippocampus stores feature conjunctions opposed individual features features appeared study appear test 
importantly accordance dual process accounts recognition memory jennings believe driven recollection sole contributor recognition memory performance 
extensive evidence exists recollection complemented fallback familiarity signal participants consult rich recollection occur 
familiarity signal mediated unspecified areas including temporal cortex shaw miller desimone 
account differs substantially computational mathematical models recognition memory 
models compute global match test probe stored memories hintzman shiffrin recollection models involves computing similarity weighted average stored memory patterns 
memory models recollection item depends critically extent components item representation linked study context chappell humphreys 
critically recollection models lacks high threshold high quality character recollection model 
evident consider effects manipulations increase interference increasing length study list increasing inter item similarity 
interference increases global matching models predict increasingly blurry recollection reflecting contribution items composite output vector models predict false recollection increase 
contrast model predicts increasing interference lead decreased correct recollection studied test probes concomitant increase erroneous types recollection recollection details mismatch studied test probes rich recollection 
prediction consistent finding correct recollection studied items decreases increasing list length 
lastly extant data certainly contradict claim recollection robust interference acknowledge additional focused experimentation needed definitively resolve issue
