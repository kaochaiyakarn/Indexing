edward de bono contributed view distinction vertical lateral thinking de bono 
vertical thinking selective sequential lateral thinking generative jumps 
vertical thinking concentrates supposed relevant aspects excludes irrelevant ones lateral thinking accidental sought event 
user searching web defined object vertical thinking done 
conversely lateral thinking primary mental behavior pure browsing activities carried 
framework lateral thinking help developing awareness serendipitous events 
decided max programmed user information follows principles lateral thinking excluding basis immediate relevance helping delaying critical judgments providing new entry points addition formulations de bono proposed practical techniques lateral thinking extent easily coded computer program random stimulation fractionation analogies selection entry points reversal method concept vertical thinking deeply related kuhn concept normal science characterized sequentially directed behavior scientist attempts articulate extend existing paradigm kuhn 
paradigm shifts occur serendipity unexpected event explained accepted paradigm leading accidental discoveries scientific revolutions kuhn roberts 
primary goal max stimulating user precise information needed provoke insight extreme cases paradigm shift

implementation max agent browses web simulation typical human browsing behavior searching information may interest user specially information user focused 
offering information max attempts stimulate creativity user providing new entry points de bono proposed techniques hopefully induce serendipitous insights 
major pillars max implementation information retrieval techniques heavy heuristic search information spaces 
simplify user interaction exchanges max mail

system architecture max composed functionally independent modules learning module suggestions formulation module fig 

user profiles learning module max architecture internet user profiles suggestions formulation module user user profile generation 
profile generation major issue project effort taken integrate structure profiles information retrieval techniques system 
goal profile generation process generate automatically profiles behalf user means machine learning algorithms 
aim profiles generation process 
assumed profiles directly fed user plain texts urls pages interest 
communication mail specified subject message label domain interest information sent max 
shows architecture max profile generation engine 
pop server mail messages labeled messages check mail component labeled messages segments extraction component expand message component web pages segments page summary expanded messages mail box expanded box internet ranking component expanded messages profiles learning module ranking rankings box synsets information ranking wordnet update profile component user profiles component launched periodically check mail registered users 
body message passed component identification user category label extracted subject field message 
second component charge expansion urls may embedded message text task includes filtering html tags traversing page links recursively resulting data just plain text 
task simplified resorting segments extraction component splits visited web page text segments returns relevant ones providing means summarizing contents lengthy pages embley jiang ng salton singhal salton 
additional step taken eliminate words non informative words articles 
third component system uses tf ifd measure term frequency inverse document frequency simplest measurement methods existing information retrieval literature oard salton buckley rank concepts relevance user message characterization 
worth noting information retrieval methods works concepts wordnet synsets miller stems typical unit information 
wordnet synsets expect increase accuracy profile generation dealing robustly synonyms compound words ex 
artificial intelligence social security supporting bene fits stems 
advantage concepts stems approach brings problem higher level abstraction closely related purposes 
fourth component simply merges ranked data existing profile call learning parameters sheth learning parameters tune agent conservative new input information maintaining normalization concepts weights 
wandering process 
search interesting information launching google tm query specially chosen words 
resulting urls browsed best style russel norvig heuristically directed user interest profiles 
shows architecture max wandering process 
user profiles google query query generator component random concepts google query result best search component segments extraction component mail message suggestions urls user suggestions formulation module 
web pages segments page summary smtp server internet component responsible generate proper google tm query 
suggestion de bono random stimulation analogies de bono domain profiles chosen randomly source profiles 
profiles words selected randomly exponential probabilistic distribution means concentrate relevant synsets discarding relevant ones 
synsets laterally max retrieves coordinates directly 
selected words merged unique query 
attempt perform cross domain integration suggested csikszentmihalyi sawyer csikszentmihalyi sawyer 
urls returned google tm web pages typically links assuming linked pages semantically related degree implemented wandering max best search guided heuristic function 
wandering quality time limited thresholds

wordnet huge lexical database english design inspired psycholinguistic theories human lexical memory 
nouns verbs adjectives stored synsets synonym sets 
synset represents lexical concept stored set underlying relations concepts forming conceptual map 
wordnet phase max operation 
learning process max transforms text set concepts thought relations explicitly established 
knowledge max holds user user profiles database concepts 
wandering process started max chooses concepts profiles manipulates putting search engine query 
information retrieval methodology converted vectorization web pages uses concepts dimension vectors 
synsets brings direct benefits abstraction raised appropriate level dealing words anymore concepts synonyms treated concept handled stems usual atomic unit information weakness stems leads underestimation weights concepts compound words handled properly instance artificial intelligence single unique concept usually decomposed distinct stems leads underestimation weights concepts concepts manipulation wordnet establishes relations concepts easier perform lateral thinking experiments instance possible obtain synonyms antonyms generalizations specializations coordinates compute concept distances generate analogies 
relevant drawback synsets usual stems overload introduced information retrieval methods vector transformation visited web pages 
reducing word stem fast lightweight operation information retrieval methods need seek wordnet database candidate concepts follow disambiguation procedures handle structured data types contain concept information 
disadvantage diminished strong benefits wordnet provides 
heuristic evaluation goal heuristic function guide max wandering
