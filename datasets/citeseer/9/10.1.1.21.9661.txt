web pages pure information mixed formatting elements making automatic processing information difficult 
xml language designed representing pure information internet 
information xml represented elements 
xml element start tag tag tags data 
example representing information book xml element named book book isbn author miguel de author title el title book see information book book book tags easy parse computer program 
author title elements considered children book element forming hierarchy 
xml document root element top hierarchy 
order allow information interchange parties xml agree element grammar semantics 
element grammar specified regular expressions dtds document type definitions 
example dtd fragment previous xml data element book author title attlist book isbn id required element author pcdata element title pcdata stated book element contain author elements title element 
xml element attributes 
example isbn defined required identification attribute book exist books value isbn attribute xml document 
elements contain text said contain pcdata stands parsed character data 
transforming xml situations xml data need transformed 
example presenting xml data html page 
xslt language transformation patterns 
xslt stylesheet xml document searches patterns xml data applies programmed transformations generating output results 
example wanted show information books web browser apply xslt transformation rule xsl template match book xsl value select title isbn xsl value select isbn written em xsl value select author em xsl template informal semantics xslt rule find book element generate title boldface isbn attribute notice prefix attributes author emphasized mode 
xslt code text literals html tags mixed element values obtained means xsl value statement
