original page webwatcher section presents design webwatcher scenario 
webwatcher information search agent invoked web hyperlink web page filling mosaic form indicate information sought publication author 
webwatcher returns user copy web page came assists user follow hyperlinks forward web search target information 
user traverses web webwatcher uses learned knowledge recommend especially promising hyperlinks user highlighting links user display

user begins process pages determine promising outgoing hyperlink 
user clicks hyperlink webwatcher updates log search retrieves page prefetched performs similar substitutions returns copy user 
process continues webwatcher tracking user search web providing advice step user elects dismiss agent
