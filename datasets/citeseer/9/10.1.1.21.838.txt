social network important official organizational structure tasks ranging immediate local problem solving example fixing piece equipment primary functions creating project teams 
part success social networks attributed degrees separation phenomena means distance individuals terms direct personal relationships relatively small 
equally important factor limits amount kinds information person able willing available public large 
example expert particular field certainly unable write knows topic unwilling letters recommendation written various people publicly available 
searching piece information situation matter searching social network expert topic chain personal referrals searcher expert 
referral chain serves key functions provides reason expert agree respond requester explicating relationship mutual collaborator provides criteria searcher evaluating trustworthiness expert 
manually searching referral chain frustrating note social network explicitly include groups people linked professional activities social limited sense recreational 
time consuming task 
faced trade contacting large number individuals step time possible respondents contacting smaller focused set fail locate appropriate expert 
response problems building referralweb interactive system reconstructing visualizing searching social networks world wide web 
simulation experiments ran began construction referralweb showed automatically generated referrals highly successful locating experts large network kautz selman 
higher degree responsiveness automated system effectively traded potentially lower accuracy individual automatic referrals generated person 

reconstructing querying social networks social network modeled graph nodes represent individuals edge nodes indicates direct relationship individuals discovered 
possible sources determining direct relationships 
extreme reject burdensome users required enter lists close colleagues 
analysis email logs provides rich source relationships shown schwartz wood 
fact initial version system derived network analyzing mail archives kautz selman 
information raises concerns privacy security hard 
current referralweb system uses occurrence names close proximity documents publicly available world wide web evidence direct relationship 
sources include ffl links home pages ffl lists authors technical papers citations papers ffl exchanges individuals recorded netnews archives ffl organization charts university departments 
network model constructed incrementally 
user registers system uses general search engine retrieve web documents mention 
names individuals extracted documents done high accuracy better techniques described sundheim grishman 
process applied recursively levels result merged global network model 
network guide search people documents response user queries 
simply person may ask find chain named individual relationship marvin minsky 
search expert user may specify topic effective social radius example query colleagues mine colleagues colleagues mine know simulated annealing 
kind query takes advantage designated known expert control search 
instance ask list documents topic annealing people close scott kirkpatrick 
important emphasize referralweb replace generic search engines altavista uses social network search focused effective 
example example requirement proximity computer scientist kirkpatrick helps disambiguate query computer science term annealing term 
social network prioritizes answers user retrieves hits people closest simply long list hundreds names documents 
referralweb number features sets apart collaborative filtering recommender projects 
referralweb attempts uncover existing social networks providing tool creating new communities 
new communities may appropriate recreational uses web emphasize helping individuals effective large existing networks professional colleagues 

recommender systems designed provide anonymous recommendations referralweb providing referrals chains named individuals 
critical sources information equally desirable 
example describe user may choose search referrals people closely associated known trusted expert 

recommender systems require user manually enter personal profile interests preferences expertise 
recommendations generated matching profiles exist system 
contrast referralweb primarily builds model users social network data mining public documents world wide web 
model includes individuals explicitly register service 

users referralweb limited set topic areas determined advance 
referralweb uses general full web indexing engine currently altavista match individuals topic areas 
referralweb system part effort develop agent programs address practical communication needs kautz selman coen 
developed internal prototypes system currently building version accessible externally web 
referralweb system expands users awareness existing communities 
typically user aware portion social network belongs 
instantiating larger community user discover connections people information lay hidden horizon
