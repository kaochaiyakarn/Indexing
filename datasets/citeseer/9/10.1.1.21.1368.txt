problem tackled different ways 
example option classify news priori hierarchy topics 
choice horizontal portals traditional electronic newspapers hierarchy correspondence structure editorial board 
consequence choice editorial systems aim supporting editorial offices 
second option generate classification dynamically indices extracted news item 
technique adopted approaches information retrieval 
options incompatible search engines web 
provide high level classification news hierarchy sections provide finer grained classification specific section 
sean decided focus option common systems 
defined hierarchy sections subsections news classified hierarchy 
specifically considered high level sections politics subsections international national politics includes subsections concerning different local communities economy structure similar politics sport subsections specific sports technology culture forth 
number reasons choice 
system aimed providing personalized electronic version classical newspapers integrated editorial software systems newspapers 
organization hierarchy sections natural choice 
second hierarchical classification including high level topics allows provide form personalization limited information user available case time users 
case fact difficult selection topics finer grain corresponding high level sections hierarchy 
shall see main focus personalization detail level presentation 
aspect paid attention propose innovative approach 
approaches literature assume repository news structured news item text file set text files 
administration repository sim ple approaches flexible techniques adopted personalization personalized filtering applied repository text files 
way difficult define strategies personalizing presentation document 
basically choice binary document retrieved shown user possibly labels specifying estimated interest level user 
hand aim structuring news way different detail levels presentation news item obtained dynamically depending content user model 
clearly different ways modifying detail level presenting news item 
expensive usually practical approach store different versions news item 
alternatively insert annotations text news item markup languages produce different versions interpreting annotations 
complex approach techniques automatically generating summaries detailed news see 
approach requires availability lot knowledge topic news adopted news refer specialized domains 
annotations interesting option approach moves idea takes step 
news viewed complex composite entities having attributes define components 
example considered attributes title author text graphics summarizing content text photos video audio clips interviews agency reports raw data detailed charts graphics forth 
attributes optional multi valued photo clip may associated news item object photo clip may associated news item 
news item regarded chunk information concerning event situation conveyed user 
reason pieces information concerning news item event may available different days possibly different attributes 
database historical storing information concerning days 
example consider news item concerning financial status acme item belongs section economy 
title text may attributes graphs describing financial status acme interview ceo interviews ardissono adaptive system personalized access news title authors full text summarizing graphics summarizing graphics pictures video audio pictures video audio titles relative days titles relative days comments interviews agency reports technical graphics raw data fig 

detail levels presentation news cial experts interviews may possibly form video audio clip agency reports concerning 
regard financial status acme news item different pieces information may available different days example may report day interviews day 
may news concerning acme news server 
example acme hi tech news item technology section concerning launch new product 
interview ceo associated news item 
main advantage approach different detail levels presentation news obtained different aggregations attributes 
example low detail level may include title detailed level may include text possibly replacing detailed level may include graphs interviews 
attributes convey complementary information pictures complement textual information certain flexibility combination attributes 
sean defined fixed number alternative aggregations called presentation formats presentation levels introduced partial order corresponding detail level provided aggregations 
formats ordering shown node adds detail provided ancestor 
example level detailed different ways adding news item full text 
main problem approach requires efforts manager news server 
fact filling repository requires adding news items database decomposing information attributes news 
effort different re quired editorial offices newspapers required software systems offices 
approach propose conceptually similar idea annotating news introduces complex form semantic decomposition news involves pieces information associated news item pictures clips graphics interviews agency reports 
sense believe approach powerful 
annotations may support finer variation detail level allowing definition different textual presentations news item 
principle approach annotations integrated 
annotations allow definition range variations presenting text introducing alternatives tree 

advertisements database personalizing advertisements inserted pages particularly important advertising main cases income companies providing services web 
selection appropriate advertisement depend aspects user ii content page advertisement added 
reasons introduced second database contains advertisements usually sort banner inserted pages 
advertisement attributes related criteria mentioned selection target segment population directed ii topic relation sections news server 

user modeling user model plays central role achieve personalization goals discussed section 
goals require different features characteristics user modeled 
example selection sections displayed related user interests expertise topic section 
selection detail level news depends user cognitive characteristics particular receptivity represents amount information read acquire 
selection advertisements depends user life style ardissono adaptive system personalized access news priorities
