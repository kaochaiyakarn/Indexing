advantages transactions general purpose system described earlier 
section explain uses detail illustrate examples servers application programs implemented quicksilver 
failure 
data stored magnetic disk lost machine rebooted ex power loss data vulnerable failures occur modified 
partially completed updates may leave data inconsistent state 
database systems atomic transactions restore data consistency failure undoing effects partial updates transac progress time failure aborted 
techniques useful general purpose system 
text editor example lose part user file crashed middle writing new version file disk 
editors typically save old version file different name delete insuring new ver sion written disk calling fsync unix 
crash user start editor special option retrieve old version file 
similar ad hoc recovery mechanisms reimplemented applications 
quicksilver avoids burden applications providing recovery file sys tem 
quicksilver distributed file system dfs sup ports transactional access files directories local remote machines 
dfs guarantees updates committed transactions safely disk lost due subsequent failures 
transaction aborts dfs undoes changes file system transaction 
files modified transaction returned original state files created transaction deleted files deleted restored files renamed moved different directory returned original directory name 
quicksilver applications rely atomicity guarantees provided dfs 
example editors call transaction commit writing file disk respectively need write separate backup copy 
quicksilver desktop utilities easily permit moving subdirectory machine clicking mouse name directory window dragging different window 
benefits style interface lost users worry rarely cases part directory moved file places 
distributed commit guarantees atomicity machines happen quicksilver 
transactions install new version quicksilver system files user machine 
ensures crash system upgrade leave machine inconsistent state 
quicksilver provides parallel facility pmake allows users build components large program parallel idle machines network 
program reads file containing set rules describing command sequence commands building corn trademark ponents program 
separate transaction command sequence 
ensures instance killed unwanted results temporary files created preprocessors yacc ex left useful object files generated compile completed killed preserved 
permits safely restart sequence commands machines crashes rebooted 
undo 
transactional recovery mechanisms free programmers worrying failures serve undo mechanism simplifies application programming 
example quicksilver provides source control system check maintaining program source files file server 
user may check set files obtaining local working copies 
modifications tested files transferred back file server check 
problem detected check procedure file properly checked space left file server check aborts transaction 
partial updates may applied source files metadata file server user machine automatically undone 
termination notification cleanup 
support atomicity updates multiple machines quicksilver transaction toolkit implement distributed commit protocol 
extending notion transaction include servers maintain volatile state possible transactions unified mechanism notification resource management system 
examples volatile servers phase variants commit protocol notified program terminates window manager destroys windows explicitly created program 
virtual terminal server closes terminal connec tions associated program standard input output 
server responsible creating processes loading programs destroys child processes created program 
advantage transactions purpose mechanism resources regardless clients local remote 
ad hoc methods resource class method separately extended distributed case 
transactions resource recovery difficult issues distribution implemented tm 
parent process started instance may remote machine 
example commands started 
user kills instance progress trans actions created aborted 
result commands running remote machines time terminated eliminating problem orphans 
parallel facility provides example transactions distributed notification mechanism 
select machines running remote computations interacts remote scheduler 
replicated server runs designated machines monitors state machines network 
accepts remote execution requests waits idle machine available tells machine run remote job 
scheduler bases decision factors cpu load keyboard idle time tracks remote jobs currently running behalf particular user jobs started 
selection algorithm depends scheduler knowing remote job terminated 
purpose scheduler participates phase server transaction uses run remote job 
simplifies scheduler interface need explicit callback scheduler job ends ensures scheduler notified instance started remote job fails job ends 
transactions unifying framework resource management simplify problem distributed notification especially parties example parallel scheduler need notified remote job ends 
concurrency control 
concurrency control techniques locking database systems synchronize access shared data order avoid problems lost updates dirty reads un repeatable reads 
transaction sys tems locking policy prevents lost updates systems implement enforce full serializability 
general purpose system synchronization re vary greatly applications 
quicksilver allows server implement concurrency control policy 
frequent think 
header file contains error modules include header file fail compile 
users typically kill soon notice error prevent flood essentially identical error messages 
choice concurrency policy quicksilver file system driven desire run standard tools applications 
environment simultaneous file system directory unrelated programs common rap directory unix system provides extreme example 
desirable able list contents directory modified transaction progress 
reason dfs enforce full ity 
dfs obtains lock directory directory renamed created deleted 
write locks individual directory entries prevent transactions renaming file name example read locks required read directory 
possible clients read directory entries changed transaction may abort 
terminology introduced gray dfs provides degree consistency directories 
choice locking policy individual files best illustrated example backup utility 
files read backup program remained locked backup transaction ended programs wanted update files wait backup completed potentially long time 
hand undesirable allow file modified read backup program 
dfs uses read write locks synchronize file access read locks released soon file closed write locks held transaction commit 
corresponds degree consistency files lost updates dirty reads reads repeatable 
applications requiring degree consistency full serializability files delay closing files releasing corresponding read locks ready commit 
dfs holds locks behalf transactions locks shared processes local remote participating transaction

section lessons learned building quicksilver system 
lesson writing transactional applications simple 
quicksilver client programs see little complexity added transactions 
default transactions facilities manipulating shell scripts permits programs contain transactional code behave atomically 
application programs fall category 
small changes long running interactive programs order exhibit correct transactional behavior 
programs necessary identify recoverable units perform shorter transactions 
example consider retrieving files file transfer utility ftp 
files transferred tp created default transaction ftp daemon locking policies dfs prevent files accessed tp daemon 
worse files automatically deleted tp daemon crashed machine rebooted 
similarly text editor needs create new transaction time writes file back disk 
simple possible quicksilver provides library push pop current default transaction 
routines add means controlling transactions standard interface case library 
alternative change interfaces library functions include explicit transaction parameter 
better programs multiple threads need transaction 
approach better suited porting existing applications single threaded anyway 
cases straightforward identify recoverable units applications need performed transactions 
non traditional uses transactions notification mech anism require careful design 
example illustrates 
earlier versions system termination default transaction associated process signal destroy process 
caused problems added facilities shell allow process run default transaction processes associated sequence commands started shell script destroyed command sequence committed 
reason problem default transaction different purposes 
obvious solution associate transaction process exclusively notifying servers take actions process terminates 
lesson writing simple transactional servers simple writing transactional servers difficult worthwhile 
effort involved making server follow quicksilver transaction protocols varies greatly depending benefit transaction toolkit server intends available clients 
extreme server window manager 
simply records tid associated ipc request created window destroys window receives commit abort notification tid tm 
comparable required server close windows tcp sockets uses inter actions clients signalled sending process disappeared 
extreme dfs uses services transaction toolkit provide clients ability undo changes individual files 
substantial part server devoted providing trans 
code complexity file system due directly design choice provide 
elected build file system felt provided useful level function non atomic file system possibility quicksilver 
precursor file system transaction mechanism signalling open files closed 
implementation overhead due transactions older file system similar window manager 
generally easier write applications quicksilver corresponding appli cations unix 
reason code necessary handle failures distributed system moved applications servers making quick dirty applications recovery code behave reasonably face failures 
application programs servers transactions net win 
lesson survived nested transactions bu useful cases 
quicksilver provide support nested transactions failure single participant transaction causes transaction abort 
facilitates automatic comprehensive cleanup presence failures difficult applications recover partial failures continue operating 
parallel utility illustrates 
command started remote machine fails machine reboots sense retry command different machine aborting 
reason uses separate trans action set commands starts remote machine 
transaction committed soon remote commands finished dfs release write locks files need accessible input subsequent steps computation 
consequence separate transactions program killed output computation steps progress time cleaned output earlier completed steps preserved 
behavior desirable typical uses program development 
uses example apply upgrade software package installed user machine 
case clearly desirable undo effects complete successfully 
current version parallel applications 
nested transactions solve problem running step computation nested subtransaction allow recover partial failures committing updates cally 
examples quicksilver nested transactions useful separate top level transactions section pointed transactional undo simplify applications failures concern check 
transactions undo mech anism generally useful application undo part updates 
separate transactions application needs commit updates transaction 
nested transactions provide powerful undo facility 
quicksilver standard library supports transparent access replicated files ries read mode 
client transaction needs able commit replica servers fails separate transactions created access remote replicas 
method read update replicated data atomically 
nested transactions separate toplevel transactions solve part problem 
updates replicated data committed transaction allowing transaction succeed replica servers fails 
extra effort needed bring server missed updates date recovers 
lesson long running update transactions problem 
long running transactions update files potential source difficulty files remain locked long time 
practice transactions problem observations 
updates performed long running interactive programs cases encapsulated shorter transactions techniques described lesson 
cases updates broken shorter transactions data written long running transaction generally need accessible applications transaction ends 
canonical example second class applications backup utility 
backing large directory tree may take long time fact archive file created backup read transactions backup completed impact programs 
long duration update transaction problem fact long transactions may arbitrarily large updates file systems uncovered major shortcoming log manager 
large update transactions require arbitrarily large amounts space log 
current implementation lm supports single line log partition disk manages circular buffer provisions garbage collection archiving line storage 
fact finite amount space available log artificially restricts size transactions modifications file system 
distorted transactions quicksilver cases forcing modify utilities multiple small transactions single large utility behave atomically 
program installs new version operating system example utility 
surprises building quicksilver system complexity required industrial strength log subsystem 
major effort underway build new log service capable garbage collecting line storage archiving network log servers line storage 
lesson long running read transactions need problem 
observed transactions run long time update large number files rare 
longrunning transactions read files hand common 
read locks held transactions potential source problems read lock prevents transactions updating file 
desire run standard unix tools applications modification decided solve problem giving strict serializability default concurrency policy quicksilver file system 
explained section dfs releases read lock file soon client closes file 
policy sufficient avoid problems associated read locks long running applications close file soon reading 
exception encountered interactive utility browsing files large view text editor 
case added code browser buffers large pieces file memory closes file reads order avoid frequent lock conflicts 
current implementation long running read transaction may cause problems keep files open 
window manager provides example phenomenon 
started runs machine switched rebooted 
de fault transaction remains active weeks months time 
window manager reads data bitmaps display fonts remote file server 
file closed immediately reading avoid interfering utilities update font files 
file server remains participant window manager transaction 
consequences 
session cm window manager machine cm file server kept open causing additional background message traffic 

state associated transaction continues occupy space non kernel tables file server machine 
window manager long running programs run machines read remote files 
result kernel tables file server machine grow eventually overflow causing server crash 
avoid problem modified library routines shell window manager user interface toolkit create separate short transactions searching reading files 
fixing immediate problem solution unsatisfactory reasons 
additional transactions created correspond meaningful units application contrast earlier mentioned changes avoiding long running update transactions 
symptom difficult track places application code needed modified files read file servers 
secondly minimize changes application code modifications embedded library routines 
transactions necessary created 
example read transactions may created committed start window application shell 
adds unnecessary overhead starting programs quicksilver 
better solution enhance transaction management communication protocols follows 
timeouts cm detect transactions inactive extended periods time 
transaction manager attempt remove remote machine list participants 
possible read transactions tm need call remote transaction manager turn ask local participating server transaction needed kept active 
servers machine agreed transaction removed ker nel tables remote machine 
active transactions required cm communication session machines cm close session 
way long running programs simply default transaction reading files server 
kernel tm cm dfs cooperate periodically reclaim inactive resources requiring new transactions 
eliminate need cations library routines application code 
lesson concurrency control policy allowing wide range consistency options desirable 
quicksilver philosophy regarding concurrency control similar adopted recovery 
different concurrency control policies serialization algorithms appropriate different kinds servers 
ery quicksilver provides log service useful variety recovery algorithms leaves choice particular algorithm implementer service 
concurrency control difficult choice best concurrency control policy depends greater extent kind services provided server services clients short transactions vs long lived ones 
case dfs goal provide file sys tem interface allow run stan dard unix tools applications 
described section specific choices default concurrency control policy dfs felt appropriate applications 
applications need synchronization cases restrictive locking policy convenient 
example case problem debugging new program 
software interrupt illegal memory address occurs test run program quicksilver starts interactive debugger killing program 
allows user inspect state program order identify problem 
transactions created program active point output files written program remain locked read user 
applies particular trace files containing information written program debugging aid 
case desirable dfs allow read access file obtaining lock 
alternative solution debugger inherit transactions created program 
tool examine output program grep utility editor started debugger participant necessary transactions 
furthermore program created transactions making difficult determine transaction examine particular output file 
dfs releases read locks file closed application reads set files guaranteed serializable respect update transactions 
application needs see consistent snapshot file system example utility installing new version software package file server user machine keep files reads open commits 
alternatively application effectively lock subtree file system temporarily renaming directory root subtree 
cleaner general solution extend dfs interface allow clients specify example read locks held file closed transaction ends solve debugging problem read locks obtained 
problem related concurrency control possibility deadlocks 
quicksilver avoid deadlocks blocking client requests case lock conflicts dfs completes request error code waiting lock held transaction released 
disadvantage approach requests completed error code deadlock 
alternative block client requests lock conflicts deadlock detector abort transactions necessary database systems 
rejected alternative reasons 
interactive program waiting user input may prevent transactions making progress cycle wait graph 
secondly way deciding transaction abort deadlock detected 
believe better clients decide actions take case lock con 
approach improved letting servers block request limited time waiting locks released 
waiting timeout expired completing request error return code server reduce probability clients observe lock conflicts
