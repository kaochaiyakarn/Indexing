addition eliminates effect due orientation tuning reveals signal enhances interior relative background 
spatial offset distance degree visual angle center square strip degree offsets representing boundary locations 
neurons preferred orientation orthogonal vertical texture boundaries enhancement relatively uniform 
neurons preferred orientation parallel texture boundaries strong boundary signal superimposed interior enhancement coloring signal 
population averaged response set vertical neurons stimulus 
initial response characterized burst magnitude correlated sensitivity local feature orientation followed sustained response lower level 
response boundary significantly higher response interior 
phenomena underscores interplay resonance competition explaining away
