profile represents set objects accessed frequently group users determined web usage mining 
objects usage profile belong class combined form aggregated pseudo object belonging class 
important benefit aggregation pattern volume significantly reduced relieving computation burden recommendation engine 
goal create aggregate representation weighted set objects characterize common interests weighted set objects usage profile movie web site example domain level aggregate profile movie web site user segment captured usage profile domain level 
aggregation process requires combination function defined attribute object domain ontology 
figures show example process 
movie object attribute name actor genre year 
attribute name interested movie names appearing instances 
define name union operation performed singleton name attributes movie objects 
hand attribute actor contains weighted set objects belonging class actor 
fact represents relation actor objects movie object 
cases vector weighted mean operation combination function 
case weight actor object determined wi wo wi applying actor example result aggregate actor object 
attribute year combination function may create range year values appearing objects 
possible solution discretize full year range decades find common decades domains attribute 
applying example may result aggregate instance year attribute year 
attribute genre concept movie contains partial order representing concept hierarchy different genre values 
combination function case perform tree graph matching extract common parts conceptual hierarchies instances 
applying genre example result aggregate instance genre attribute genre value romance 
shows item level usage profile representation weighted set objects 
depicts resulting domain level aggregate profile 
note original item level profile gives little information reasons objects commonly accessed 
characterize profile domain level find interesting patterns belong genre romance actor high score compared actors 
tell group users interested particularly movies belonging romance particularly fond actor current user profile aggregate usage profiles match profiles extended user profile instantiate real web objects recommendations online recommendation enhanced domain ontologies online recommendation phase contrast transaction usage profiles semantic usage profiles capture underlying common properties relations objects 
fine grained domain knowledge captured aggregate form enables powerful approaches personalization 
consider browsing history current user active session weighted set web pages user visited 
transformation described subsection create semantic representation user active session 
call representation current user profile 
presents basic procedure generating recommendations semantic usage profiles 
recommendation engine matches current user profile discovered domain level aggregate profiles 
usage profiles matching score greater pre specified threshold considered represent user potential interests 
successful match implies current user shares common interests group users represented usage profile 
matching process results extended user profile obtained applying aggregation process described matching domain level profiles original user profile 
recommendation engine instantiates user extended profile real web objects recommend user 
exploit structural relationships classes recommendation process
