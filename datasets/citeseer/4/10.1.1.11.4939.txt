recommender systems help users identify particular items best match tastes preferences 
apply agent theory domain standard centralized recommender system distributed world recommender agents 
due agent world new information filtering method appears opinion filtering method 
main idea consider agents personal entities rely 
recommender agents ask reliable friends opinion particular item filter large sets items 
reliability expressed trust value agent labels neighbors 
opinion filtering method needs model trust collaborative world 
model proposed emphasizes agent looks agents situation lack information remaining passive providing negative empty answer user 
social model trust exploits preserving privacy 
recommender systems recommendations users information available 
information includes data items different profiles users web 
information fundamental issue select appropriate information decisions 
words information filtering method essential 
usually information filtering approaches state art making recommendations demographic filtering content filtering collaborative filtering 
hybrid approaches proved useful 
apply agent theory recommender systems standard centralized recommender system distributed world recommender agents 
user recommender agent able interact 
open environment internet interaction recommender agent possible agents order obtain best recommendation user 
solution propose new information filtering method opinion filtering method 
main idea consider agents personal entities rely 
reliability expressed trust value agent labels neighbors 
trust important social concepts helps human agents cope social environment human interaction :10.1.1.24.5695
efforts study social models trust market environments agents compete individual profit environments agents need delegate actions agents 
trust important filtering information environments recommender agents asses users 
just real world people ask friends advice interesting items agent able ask reliable agents 
example common situation somebody asks friend advice new restaurant 
common situation discovers new restaurant wants know opinion friends somebody tells new restaurant want check information friends 
know restaurant give opinion know features restaurant cuisine price 
guess opinion 
people ask just advice 
people ask advice friends similar tastes interests trusted 
people know people similar tastes interests 
usually interaction 
want know tastes interests ask opinion 
instance restaurant example ask opinion restaurants love restaurants hate 
person similar opinion consider similar preferences 
information filtering context agents considered reliable honesty trustworthy information similar preferences interest styles 
opinion filtering method propose model trust collaborative world recommender agents 
mainly provide recommender agents technology allows look similar agents offer advice 
model proposed emphasizes agent looks agents situation lack information remaining passive providing negative empty answer user 
social model exploits preserving privacy 
new approach information filtering method follows 
section justifies need trust recommender agents

information filtering methods proposed current state art demographic filtering content filtering collaborative filtering 
demographic filtering approaches descriptions people learn relationship single item type people object 
content filtering approaches descriptions content items learn relationship single user description items 
collaborative filtering approaches feedback set people set items recommendations ignore content items descriptions people 
researchers claim hybrid systems 
hybrid systems exploit features content collaborative filtering certainly prove complementary 
traditional collaborative filtering systems employ simplistic approach directly recommends new items basis similarity profiles different users 
means users similar profiles exchange recommendations 
similar user gives unsuccessful advice way ignoring 
agent causes descent performance agents 
marsh proposes concept trust agents vulnerable 
trust basic kind action uncertain world particular crucial form collaboration autonomous agents 
standard definition trust 
gives definition closer approach 
claims observations important trust defines trust trust outcome observations leading belief actions may relied explicit guarantee achieve goal risky situation notes trust developed time outcome series confirming observations called dynamics trust 
experimental concludes information regarding reasoning process agent actual agent affect trust 
trust formed updated time direct interactions information provided members society experiences 
event influence degree trust interpreted agent negative positive experience 
event interpreted negative experience agent loose trust degree interpreted positive agent gain trust degree 
degree trust changes depends trust model agent 
implies trusting agent carries form continual verification validation subject trust time 
applying concept trust collaborative world approach solve de problem arises similar agent gives frustrated recommendations decreasing trust agent ignoring advice 
trust provides new method filtering information 
advantage communication agent ask agents opinion item 
differs typical collaborative filtering approach way agent ask recommendation opinion 
opinion interest agent thinks user item 
opinion directly recommendation agent includes reasoning combines agents opinions order decide recommend item 
call new process filtering information agents opinions opinion information filtering method 
important note new approach emphasizes agents 
say agent knowledge decide recommendation turn agents web order look similar agents gather information 
opinion information filtering method main idea consider agents personal entities rely 
reliability expressed trust value agent labels neighbors 
trust value initially computed interaction proactive playing agents procedure 
agent ask agents list known items gathers opinion items 
agents ask queried agents opinion item user loves hates 
similarity opinion provided agents able infer trust value neighbor 
contact address friend agents agents high trust value kept 
agent set friends filter information 
agent sure recommendation discovers new item asks reliable agents opinion uses trust values decide item interesting user see 
agent opinion agents consensus achieved aggregation measure 
result consensus provides confidence value agent decide convenience recommending item user 
suppose similar agents provide pertinent opinions may give inadequate ones 
trust modified goes depending results recommendations order improve acquaintance 
applying agent approach recommender systems trust collaborative world typical information filtering methods contentbased collaborative filtering applied 
performance content filtering method approach collaborative filtering method improved agents believe recommendations agents high trusting value 
get hybrid approach opinion content collaborative filtering
