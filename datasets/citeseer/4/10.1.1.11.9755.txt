web database web predominantly comprised unstructured static documents pockets structured knowledge exist capable providing answers large number questions 
example cia world factbook provides political geographic economic information country world biography com contains profiles thousands famous famous people internet movie database contains entries hundreds thousands movies including information cast production staff omnibase serves structured query interface heterogeneous data world wide web 
course impossible impose uniform schema entire web 
omnibase adopts stylized relational model call object property value data model 
framework data sources contain objects properties questions translated requests value properties 
natural language commonly employs relation possessive express relationship object property director la la director 
table shows alternative ways ask value object property 
clearly possible types queries fall model questions relation objects get boston new york 
experiments reveal practice questions type occur quite frequently 
example just web sources fashioned manner turned sufficient handling trec qa track questions

natural language annotations serve enabling technology allows integration start omnibase 
start capable handling questions ad hoc fashion 
suppose user asks directed gone wind natural language system analyze question knowing gone wind treated single lexical item question sense say flown street omnibase identifies names objects data sources associated example hunting comes movie data source united states comes country data source help start understand user question read directed lets start know data source contains required information 
annotations describe arbitrary fragments knowledge reason employed describe omnibase queries 
fact annotations parameterized contain symbols representative entire class objects 
example annotation person wrote imdb movie canbe attached omnibase query retrieves database imdb

start translates user queries structured request object property value model get imdb movie gone wind director case natural language system needed user asking director property object gone wind information data source imdb movie 
omnibase looks data source property find associated script applies script order retrieve property value object
