comparable corpora case collections articles produced different newswire agencies events 
related corpora key capture paraphrases surface bear little resemblance nature data descriptions information 
note acquire paraphrases individual corpora lack clues sentence equivalence single corpora means conservative selecting paraphrases items structurally similar 
approach main steps 
working comparable corpora separately compute lattices compact graph representations find commonalities automatically derived groups structurally similar sentences 
identify pairs lattices different corpora paraphrases identification process checks lattices take similar arguments 
input sentence paraphrased match lattice paraphrase matched lattice mate generate output sentence

appendix appendix describe insert slots lattices form slotted lattices 
recall backbone nodes lattices represent words appearing sentences lattice built 
mentioned intuition areas high variability backbone nodes may correspond arguments slots 
key thing note different phenomena giving rise multiple parallel paths argument variability described synonym variability 
example contains parallel paths corresponding synonyms injured wounded 
note want remove argument variability generate paraphrases sentences arbitrary arguments want preserve synonym variability order generate variety sentence rewritings 
distinguish situations analyze split level backbone nodes regions multiple paths 
basic intuition probably variability associated arguments synonymy example datasets increase number locations mentioned rises faster number synonyms appearing 
synonymy threshold set held parameter tuning follows 
edges backbone node lead node high variability warrant inserting slot node 
incorporate reliable synonyms backbone structure preserving nodes reached sentences passing neighboring backbone nodes 
furthermore backbone nodes labelled special generic tokens replaced slot nodes probably represent arguments condense adjacent slots 
nodes degree lower synonymy threshold removed assumption probably represent idiosyncrasies individual sentences 
see examples 
shows example lattice slotted lattice derived process just described 
arrested sentences lead delete lead nodes sentences preserve nodes near synonym variability near argument variability node replace slot sentences lead store restaurant grocery station cafe wounded injured simple sentence examples types variability 
double boxed nodes backbone nodes edges show consecutive words sentence 
synonymy threshold set example determines type variability
