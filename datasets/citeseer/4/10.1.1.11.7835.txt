topic specific web crawler program searching information related interested topics internet 
main property topic specific crawling crawler need collect web pages selects retrieves relevant pages 
crawler computer program determine relevant web page literature researches mentioning topic specific crawling 
example breadth search pagerank focused crawling shark search adaptive agent reinforcement learning artificial life agent arbitrary predicate main purpose algorithms gather relevant web pages possible 
assessment topic specific web crawling showed relevant graph represents proportion number relevant web pages total number downloaded web pages 
proportion high early period crawling process means crawler collect relevant web pages irrelevant ones 
mentioned algorithms efficient provide detail crawling 
information crawling processes need done 
problem concentrate crawling process done efficient way keep track change web pages 
presents algorithm covers detail consecutive 
add learning ability previous crawling improve efficiency consecutive crawling processes 
argue crawler kinds learnable knowledge seed urls topic keywords url prediction 
seed urls crawler needs urls point relevant web pages 
topic keywords crawler needs appropriate keywords interested topics 
url prediction crawler needs predict pages 
knowledge bases considered experience crawler

section concludes 

learnable web crawler section shortly explain characteristic web crawler learnable ability 
build knowledge bases previous crawling 
knowledge bases seed urls topic keywords url prediction 
previous crawling may efficient crawling may efficient crawler uses knowledge bases experience 
seed urls support crawler collect relevant web pages possible 
topic keywords support crawler recognize appropriate keywords matching topic 
url prediction supports crawler predict relevancy pages unvisited urls 
seed urls seed urls important crawler 
urls contain relevant web pages crawler possibility find relevant ones 
crawler knowledge base seed urls interested topic deduced search result selected search engine 
normally search engines rank search results popular ranking techniques pagerank hits authority hub scores 
page highest authority score ranked result 
set seed urls deduced selected search engines pages high authority scores probably relevant pages 
seed urls may low hub scores may crawler able find relevant pages 
solve problem really want set seed urls url high hub score high authority score 
hub page point relevant pages 
build knowledge base seed urls need number web pages previous crawling compute hub authority scores pages algorithm 
show method space limitation 
topic keywords normally document having content related topic composed set keywords frequently appear topic 
example tcp ip document contained keywords tcp ip header packet protocol crawler uses keywords clue guideline topic specific crawling 
crawler misses relevant pages crawler little significant keywords popular keywords topic considered 
example crawler topic specific crawling tcp ip documents keywords tcp ip means page containing words tcp ip retrieved crawler 
hand page contain words tcp ip retrieved contains words header packet protocol 
topic keywords important factor built knowledge base crawler 
build knowledge base topic keywords need set relevant web pages 
extract texts title title tag tag relevant page 
give crawler frequent keyword sets 
crawler memorize keywords popular keywords topic 
keywords extracted title title tag frequently occurred relevant pages keywords extracted tag frequently occurred pages point relevant pages 
url prediction crawling content page known crawler finished downloading page 
page downloaded crawler guided anchor text decide page retrieved 
anchor text relate topic interested content page relevant 
contrary anchor text relate topic content page relevant 
words crawler blind crawling 
comparing human learning ability human skills knowledge 
human learn experience skill knowledge 
need crawler ability learn human 
crawler blind crawling gain experience memorizing seen 
benefit content recognition utilized crawling processes 
crawler decide url contains relevant page get previous seen content page database predict new content 
refer technique url prediction 
url prediction helps crawler strongly decide url downloaded 
predict content url compute page similarity content previous crawled pages interested topic 
algorithm crawling crawler knowledge base 
knowledge bases accumulated consecutive 
separate crawling algorithm parts crawling knowledge base crawling knowledge bases 
crawling knowledge base crawling crawler knowledge 
crawling knowledge base consecutive 
knowledge bases progressively built previous crawling 
crawling kb topic seed urls search topic keywords topic foreach url seed urls url topic url title url description url score sim keywords url topic enqueue url queue url url score url url queue url dequeue url max score url queue page fetch new document url page score sim keywords page foreach link extract urls page link score sim keywords link anchortext page score enqueue url queue link link score 
pseudo code crawling knowledge bases algorithm 
crawling kb kb topic seed urls get seed url kb topic keywords get topic keyword kb topic foreach url seed urls url score get pred score kb topic url enqueue url queue url url score url url queue url dequeue url max score url queue page fetch new document url page score sim keywords page foreach link extract urls page pred link score get pred score kb topic url link score sim keywords link anchortext pred link score page score enqueue url queue link link score 
pseudo code crawling knowledge bases algorithm 
crawler knowledge base crawling process algorithm knowledge base illustrated 
assign topic crawler gets seed urls search result selected search engine 
crawler rank seed urls similarity scores titles description texts puts url queue implemented priority queue 
knowledge base topic topic keyword 
crawler gets set new urls predict urls contain relevant pages 
done computing scores similarity score anchor text similarity score parent page 
considerably crawler knowledge crawling process may efficient 
suppose crawling better crawler gain experience crawling 
denote kb knowledge bases crawler 
crawling knowledge bases illustrated assign topic crawler 
crawler gets seed urls knowledge bases get seed url function 
seed urls hubs point relevant pages 
crawler gets keywords matching topic 
topic keywords obtained get topic keyword function 
crawler gets set new urls predict urls contain relevant pages computing scores similarity score anchor text similarity score parent page predicting score urls 
crawler computes predicting score get pred score function 
shows process crawling algorithm 
crawler knowledge process algorithm gain crawling 
hand crawler process second algorithm started 
crawling process crawler learn data log generate knowledge bases functions learn seed url learn topic keyword learn url prediction 
knowledge bases consecutive crawling processes efficient crawling 
learnable crawling topic kb collection crawling kb topic collection crawling kb kb topic learn previous crawling kb seed urls learn seed url collection kb keywords learn topic keyword collection kb url predict learn url prediction collection 
pseudo code learnable crawling 

learning analysis consider crawler collect relevant pages crawling process 
evaluate crawling efficiency relevant graph shown 
relevant graph records relationship number collected pages number relevant pages crawling 
axis percentage collected pages axis percentage relevant pages collected 
call curves learning curves 
curve shows bad crawling example crawling process crawler retrieve relevant pages comparing total pages collected 
curve assuming crawling example represent base line separate crawling example bad 
curve crawling example crawling process crawler retrieve relevant pages comparing total pages collected 
relevant pages collected pages 
learning curves 
see learning tendency crawler consecutive crawling examining learning curves 
define types learning negative learning positive learning 
crawler negative learning ability collect relevant pages crawling process consecutive illustrated 
evidently want crawler 
way crawler positive learning ability collect relevant pages crawling process consecutive 
example illustrated percentage relevant pages crawler retrieve increases second third crawling respectively 
result come seed urls topic keywords fact url prediction works
