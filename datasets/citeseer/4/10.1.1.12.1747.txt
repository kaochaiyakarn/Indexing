past years seen new provable lattice methods solving problems priori linear definitely opens new fields applications 
interestingly provable lattice results introduced cryptanalysis area security proofs 
paradoxically time series complexity results lattice reduction emerged giving rise family cryptographic schemes hardness lattice problems 
resulting cryptosystems enjoyed different fates probably early tell secure practical cryptography built hardness lattice problems 
questions lattices remain open
