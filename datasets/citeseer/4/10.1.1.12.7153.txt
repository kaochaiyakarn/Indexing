ll briefly describe different agents initial taga game 
auction service agent asa operates auctions markets taga 
market types currently include english dutch auctions dynamic markets similar ebay 
service agent sa offers travel related service units airline tickets lodging entertainment tickets 
class travel related service multiple providers different service quality level limited service units 
allows agents query description service type service quality location inventory quantity price certain type goods 
agents may directly buy service units published service interface 
sa bids intentionally auctions sell listing goods auction wait proper buyer 
travel agent ta business helps customers acquire travel service units organizes travel plan 
units bought directly service agents auction server 
bulletin board agent bba provides mechanism helps customer agents find engage travel agents 
customer agent ca represents individual customer particular travel constraints preferences

agent communication previous tacs straightforward client server architecture single tac server manages travel service suppliers customers 
game participants write travel agency ta agents connect clients central tac server 
ta agents interact service providers centralized markets 
architecture greatly simplifies development tac infrastructure programming tac client poor model commerce real world 
peer peer multiagent systems offer realistic model customers service providers various kinds middlemen including market providers operate autonomous peer agents 
agents develop complex strategies involve combination direct transactions ta hotel auction mediated transactions various kinds 
adopting multiagent systems approach supports environment aspects commerce integrated natural manner service discovery information seeking negotiation decision making commitment transaction execution fipa standards offer mature published specifications multi agent systems communication interactions infrastructure emphasis agent communication languages protocols 
fipa framework taga 
inn remainder section briefly describe additional interaction protocols developed taga choices content languages ontologies 
dynamic contract interaction protocol 
facilitate agents making contracts dynamically agents mediated system defined dynamic contract interaction protocol shown 
bba helps initiator ca find appropriate group participants ta 
participants candidates enter contract initiator successful 
contract struck moa joins post contract activities ensure parties fulfill contract initiator pays successful contract participant pay penalty unable fulfill contract 
dynamic contract interaction protocol protocol composed standard fipa interaction protocols 
initially fipa recruiting interaction protocol specification initiator find participant help initiator sends proxy message embedded cfp message find participant sends refuse message back initiator agree message 
forwards cfp message known participants sends inform done proxy message back initiator finished 
cfp message received participant evaluates information decides send propose message initiator 
participant decides submit proposal action required 
participant interacts initiator fipa propose interaction protocol specification participants send proposal message contains proposed contract initiator initiator selects brief description include richness fipa agent communication language 
refuse action example include optional proposition truth partial reason agent refusing proposal 
interested readers encouraged explore relevant specifications available fipa org profitable proposal sends accept proposal selected participant participant receives reject proposal messages 
accept proposal message initiator participant means contract signed parties 
participant needs acquire resource unit fulfill contract 
moa responsible monitoring contract result informs related parties 
auction interaction protocol 
auction types supported taga model 
traditional auction types anthony english auction dutch auction initialized seller announces goods available sale 
buyers respond submitting bids willing pay highest price wins 
auction simulates auction www com initiated buyer 
buyer creates auction goods intends price wishes pay 
response seller wins auction 
support auction defined fipa interaction protocol shown 
auction interaction protocol auction interaction protocol composed fipa protocols 
fipa request interaction protocol specification creating auction informing auction result 
auction server asa creates auction instance receives request message buyer ta sends back agree message 
refuse message sent back unable unwilling create auction 
auction server uses fipa propose interaction protocol specification process bidding auction 
sends cfp message known seller agents sa 
seller agent decides accept offered price target retail price stock number 
seller agent decides sell goods sends proposal message auction server 
accept proposal message comes signed contract sent auction server receives valid proposal 
incoming proposal message subsequently rejected reject proposal message 
auction server informs buyer agent auction result reports contract information moa 
proposal message received auction expires timeout period appropriate failure message sent buyer 
content language 
content language language express content messages exchanged agents 
fipa communication infrastructure allows agents communicate mutually understandable content language long satisfied minimal criteria fipa compliant content language fipa 
published fipa specifications provide library registered fipa compliant content language including fipa sl xml rdf 
content language able express rich forms content efficiently processed fit existing technology 
xml language adopted tac system express messages conversation lots parsing tools available 
xml language adopted tac system express messages conversation lots parsing tools available 
representation language xml provided essentially mechanism declare simple data structures desired language expressing complex knowledge 
enhancements basic xml xml scheme addressed shortcomings result adequate language representing reasoning kind knowledge essential realizing semantic web vision 
taga system uses rdf content language agent communication 
benefits adopting stronger semantically rich content language rdf facilitates higher level interoperability agents agreeing meaning conveyed simpler applications share meaningful content 
actions exchanged taga include statements price hotel day requests create airline auction instance contracts travel agent ta successful organized travel package customer joe pay ta ta pay compensation joe 
policies win contract customer joe travel agent reputation better average reputation computed comparing customers fulfilled travel package vs served customers 
currently revising taga framework owl dean content language 
owl defined model theoretic semantics axiomatic specification determines intended interpretations language 
owl unambiguously computer interpretable making amenable agent interoperability automated reasoning techniques 

discussion section briefly discuss additional design issues addressed taga 
service description matching 
fipa agents associated fipa platforms offers set agent services including directory facility df agent handles service registration matching 
register content df include service information service type owner 
specific service information may useful searching agent services 
example customer may want booking hotel star rating close public transportation offers breakfast accepts visa card payments 
achieved daml daml profile 
taga travel service provider describes service process model daml language publishes web page 
covers basic service information address phone number service interface information 
example hotel may describe booking service customer name payment methods travel date input reserve number output effect booking room occupied travel date 
travel agent responsible organizing travel package able contact customer agent related service agents finds best match 
travel agent loads daml parsing rule planning rules build xsb sagonas reasoning engine
