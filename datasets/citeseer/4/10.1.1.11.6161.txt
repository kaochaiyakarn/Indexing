standard techniques transforming non binary constraint problem binary dual graph hidden variable methods 
alternatively obtain binary constraint model directly trick integer variables represent positions 
de ne variables denoting positions ones zeroes row column giving sets variables denote positions row ones zeroes 
similarly cf denote positions ones zeroes column denote shared positions ones rows rf domain bg cf domain vg 
constraints follows 
zero placed place row values agree column values 
zero placed row column position zero placed corresponding column row position 
agree state directly involve non binary constraints 
state indirectly rows share position zero placed row 
positions ones zeroes di erent rows columns ensure location contains entry 
exactly variables row column ensures row column position assigned zero
