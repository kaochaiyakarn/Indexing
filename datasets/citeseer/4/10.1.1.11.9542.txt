news grouped stories event topic detection tracking tdt style system developed columbia 
tdt systems columbia uses learned weighted combination features determine similarity stories grouping articles event 
www cs columbia edu nlp typically generates summaries clusters news hlt san diego calif usa stories cases event generates lot interest may find larger cluster example november rd generated summary articles describing advance troops 
began running september th summarization system robust run daily basis 
interested archiving news september th events 
archives see bottom web page show progress interface time moved rudimentary classification events level hierarchical classification current version 
unique integration tdt summarization provide system daily browsing news 
integration separate components papers previously published introduced number unexpected research issues 
summarizers designed generate summaries single event 
current tdt approaches produce clusters topically related necessarily single event 
needed create fine grained clustering produce kind input needed summarizer 
second wide variety news find online environment needed multiple strategies allow summarize different kinds news clusters 
led multiple summarization systems architecture router automatically determines summarization system invoked 
third user interface needs inherent displaying large quantities information day created demands clustering summarization process 
example early implementation single level clustering feed document sets summarizer 
results provide useful breakdown large quantities news browsing 
led interleaving categorization clustering create hierarchical view news new approach generating labels clusters 
overview system discussing gathering news organization events subsequent summarization events integration related images 

system description follows pipeline architecture 
system crawls web news articles followed pre processing phase normalizes text standard form extracts images 
news articles clustered event clusters clusters grouped higher level putting related events 
events categorized top level categories 
multidocument summary created event cluster augmented pictures extracted articles 

gathering news currently crawls news sites including cnn reuters fox news ny post usa today 
list sites stored text file may change time 
site traversed maximum depth currently links site considered 
page examined amount text largest cell page stripping tags links greater particular constant currently characters assumed news article text extracted 
note tables web sites format page largest table cell usually contains body text article 

organization stories hierarchically classifies news stories gathered crawler levels 
top level uses text categorization determine story falls predetermined categories international financial entertainment science technology sports 
calculate category tf idf vectors category compare tf idf vector article cluster categories 
manner articles assigned closest similar cosine measure category 
classify cluster category largest number articles cluster assigned 
calculations smooth estimated frequencies articles smoothing bins 
categories shown large orange bands main front page shown category april nd 
broad category articles organizes news stories hierarchical levels 
lowest level corresponds articles event see underlined text egan says mistakes handling sex abuse cases higher level groups related events shown bold heading group events united states rome pope john paul ii 
hierarchical clustering system developed columbia 
particular day specific events related united states 
related clusters different event summary page containing articles event 
system uses agglomerative clustering average similarity function 
distinguished usual tf idf weighted words linguistically motivated features terms noun phrase heads proper nouns correlate events simply topically related stories 
incorporates log linear statistical model automatically adjusting relative weights different features 
evaluated news clustering system tdt data 
system performs comparably top tdt participants measures outperforms macro averaged detection cost 
empirically determined thresholds clustering levels single event group related events 
facilitate user interaction categorized stories provide labels cluster 
lowest event level articles closely related content heuristics select article related articles cluster label entire cluster article title shown blue main page 
second level related events extract articles cluster proper names terms weigh total frequency inverse document frequency select terms representative related events shown black heading group events 

summarizing events sets clustered articles corresponding lowest event level sent columbia summarizer generate summaries events 
columbia summarizer composite summarization system uses different summarization strategies dependent type documents cluster contrasts systems typically perform type summarization 
router automatically determines type documents cluster invokes appropriate summarization multigen summary ponent 
training corpus provided duc manually derived typology document sets 
single event documents center single event happening place roughly time involving agents actions 
biography documents deal event concerning person include background information person 
multi event documents describe events occurring different places times usually different reported 
common theme events cluster collect fire incidents unrelated cruise ships 
time span covered unpredictable longer single event case 
clusters contain loosely related documents fit categories 
summarize documents event columbia summarizer uses enhanced version multigen 
multigen integrates machine learning statistical techniques identify similar sentences set set similar sentences called themes input articles 
uses alignment parse trees find intersection similar phrases sentences 
orders selected themes uses language generation cut paste similar phrases theme sentences 
theme corresponds roughly sentence summary 
biographical documents uses alternate system dems dissimilarity engine multidocument summarization tuned biographical task sets loosely similar documents uses dems general configuration 
dems selects sentences contain information important interesting included summary 
uses combination features critical new information detection traditional heuristics single document summarization 
example uses frequencies concepts sets synonyms opposed individual words combined global information words appear lead sentence determine article sentence included summary 
biographies incorporates techniques system developed jointly mitre columbia 
sets similar sentences input generation strategy multigen applicable duc 
investigated ways rewrite summary continuing explore techniques 
clusters closely related duc needed summarizer handle clusters closely related single event descriptions 
example shows summary loosely connected set articles related afghanistan borders afghanistan visit cheney area 
dems selected different important facts articles necessarily sequentially strongly linked 
case summary provides overview different topics touched articles 
shows multigen summary single event fire grew control new mexico 
summary sentences relate different stages sequence events dems summary exception sentence fires year 
sentences ordered chronologically summary 
individual summary sentences drawn pieces article sentences 
shows sentence summary generated pieces similar phrases theme produced 
third theme sentence provides summary wording blaze started 
note exact wording third sentence information repeated different sentences theme 
second sentence theme contributes clause mistakenly thinking cold 
information repeated sentences theme 

adding related images selects displays thumbnails images related event page summary events displayed 
web crawling phase addition looking news articles looks embedded images articles 
articles taken different sources web sources change time important rules system find images general applied multiple sites 
rules extract appropriate images advertisements inappropriate images 
weighted precision higher recall users notice certain images inappropriate images visible 
patterns noticed manually examining news sites images cell article embedded cell 
images jpeg tend appropriate formats advertisements link related 
images word ad advertisement url probably appropriate 
combining rules system achieve nearly perfect precision recalling high majority appropriate images 
currently working rules retrieve corresponding captions images 
prior research developed techniques categorizing images captions image features 
current ongoing research exploring categorization images sub categories news categories shallow parsing captions simple word similarity metrics 
example news concerning disasters main subject verb sentence image determine image focuses victims workers responding 
research incorporated displaying images similar content allowing users browse search group
