security accounts passwords concern developers users unix 
unix younger password encryption algorithm simulation cipher machine army world war ii morris 
fair encryption mechanism difficult invert proper circumstances suffered fast algorithm 
pdp encryption took approximately ms pos sible check roughly passwords second 
armed dictionary words cracker compare encryptions stored password file little minutes 
clearly security hole worth filling 
post versions unix des algorithm des encrypt passwords 
user password des key algorithm encrypt constant 
algo rithm iterated times result character string plus character salt method similarly difficult decrypt complicated possible salt values added advantage slow 
vax ii machine tially faster pdp single encryption takes order ms determined cracker check approximately encryptions second 
checking dictionary words take hours cpu time

checking passwords system accounts take average cpu days random selection salt values practically guarantees user password encrypted different salt guarantee success 
new slow algorithm com user education needed prevent selection obvious passwords problem solved

action reaction results 
clearly needs done safeguard security systems attack 
intention enhancing security study undertaken 
knowing kind passwords users able prevent easily thwart cracker 
approach eliminating easy guess passwords periodically run password checker pro gram scans passwd tries break passwords raleigh 
approach major drawbacks 
checking time consuming 
system accounts take month check 
check bad check users find easy circumvent easy checks vulnerable pass words 
second drawback resource consuming 
machine password checking useful fast password checker extremely cpu intensive 
popular approach easy guess passwords force users change passwords frequency 
theory eliminate easy guess pass words prevents cracker dissecting passwd leisure account broken account password changed
