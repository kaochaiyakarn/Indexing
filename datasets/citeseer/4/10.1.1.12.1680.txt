abstraction dangerous weapon artificial intelligence researchers fond pointing ai denied rightful successes 
popular story goes idea solve particular sort problem playing chess known ai problem 
algorithm developed ai researchers successfully tackles problem ai claim problem solvable algorithm wasn really ai problem

claim ai researchers guilty self deception 
partition problems components

typically ai succeeds defining parts problem unsolved ai 
principal mechanism partitioning abstraction

ai abstraction usually factor aspects perception motor skills 
argue hard problems solved intelligent systems shape solutions problems constrains greatly correct solutions small pieces intelligence remain 
early ai concentrated games geometrical problems symbolic algebra theorem proving formal systems 
case semantics domains fairly simple 
late sixties early seventies blocks world popular domain ai research 
uniform simple semantics 
key success represent state world completely explicitly 
search techniques planning understood world 
learning done blocks world simple concepts worth learning captured enumerating set subexpressions contained formal description world including instance concept 
blocks world vision research mobile robotics provided strong constraints perceptual processing necessary 
eventually criticism surfaced blocks world toy world simple special purpose solutions considered general problems 
time funding crisis ai uk active places ai research time 
ai researchers forced relevant 
moved complex domains trip planning going restaurant medical diagnosis soon new slogan representation key ai conceptually efficient programs 
idea representing pertinent facts explicitly semantics world surface quite complex reduced simple closed system 
abstraction relevant details simplified problems

perform abstractions programs ai done blocks world 
blocks slightly different shapes colors underlying semantics changed greatly

abstraction reduces input data program experiences perceptual world humans 
vision researchers independently fill details time place
