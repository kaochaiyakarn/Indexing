web crawler mail reader web crawler gathers daily news multiple sources including general news sources newspapers medical sources communicable disease reports world health organization promed moderated electronic forum medical professionals exchange reports spread infectious diseases 
added coverage crawler invokes news search engine small set keywords relevant epidemics diseases 
addition system incorporates mail reader interface information mailing lists added data base received 
general news sources system applies keyword filter requiring set keywords derived event patterns extraction system described section document sent extraction engine 
done efficiency purposes avoid processing totally irrelevant articles

structure event data base record information disease outbreaks developed relatively simple event structure primary components range dates location name disease number type organisms affected organisms died 
disease report may give rise substantial number elementary events 
example people infected died generates events data base people infected week bringing total 
events may contain sub events geographically temporally example 
data base includes linking fields intended capture containment relations 
normalization data critical support effective retrieval information 
dates date expressions including dates relative report time week normalized standard form explicit day month year ranges 
city area names tagged country gazetteer major cities information document 
disease names normalized list disease synonyms 
events stored relational data base implemented mysql 

extraction engine extraction engine multi phase finite state transducer previously muc evaluations extraction tasks

interface provide access data base web interface provides spreadsheet presentation data base records 
users select subsets combination attributes including date location disease type 
event linked back corresponding text record selecting event spreadsheet brings text highlights event components date location disease suitably 
allows rapid validation extracted information review associated information

status plans current data base incorporates promed reports disease outbreak events infectious disease reports addition currently accumulating events reported chicago sun times various sources retrieved northern light news search engine plan add news sources 
access documents event data base created information extraction significant advantages keyword browsing 
requiring disease names context outbreaks excludes incidental mentions descriptions treatments having normalized dates allows searches date ranges possible original documents associating countries city area names similarly allows search geographical regions 
example query countries reported outbreaks past year answered quickly event data base difficult answer efficiently keyword search 
addition tabular structures provide compact summary outbreaks particular region involving particular disease 
informal evaluation conducted september task designed mitre required prepare report hour period indicated benefit tabular structures rapid creation summaries 
hand set extraction patterns incomplete instances disease outbreaks 
circumstances exhaustively review documents returned keyword search disease results comprehensive 
user may time exhaustive review combination client side interface earlier version written troy server side interface written joshua rosenblatt 
keyword extraction search offer user flexibility 
avenue development continue mitre lead ife bio contractor integrate event extraction technology routing retrieval system 
add sources system seeing multiple reports outbreaks 
problem potential strength 
event entries individual documents kept separate user redundant entries reporting event potential distraction 
combining compatible entries yield multiple benefits 
extraction patterns events chance missing event stated differently sources considerably reduced data base complete 
data successfully extracted sources reported improved confidence 
area focus continue development 
important direction extension involves linking infectious disease reports news events developed information extraction capability natural disasters floods earthquakes 
natural disasters repercussions involving disease outbreaks 
linked data bases common formatted fields location date allow event search summary multiple dimensions
