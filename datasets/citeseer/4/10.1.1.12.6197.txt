boris katz jimmy lin dennis quan mit artificial intelligence laboratory technology square ma usa boris ai mit edu knows sharing notations requires considerable effort document author give original period time 
keeping documents electronic form alleviates problems 
fact date internet annotation concentrated types document topic specific applications mentioned 
example microsoft research studied microsoft office product posting documents web engaging online discussions 
believe kinds software packages go long way supporting exchange ideas online areas functionality need improvement 
powerful annotations locating items subjectively match certain criteria 
example buying product commerce website find customer complaints webpage featuring product 
specific product sought identified 
major advantage going bookstore buying online ability speak sales associate ask person suggest mystery novel long flight tokyo websites unable offer advice expose customer feedback interfaces geared allowing users browse annotations sake find objects specification

data model basic rdf data model consists series nodes graph represent objects arcs connecting nodes represent relationships objects 
arc called predicate conjunction nodes connects collectively termed statement rdf parlance unit information rdf model 
furthermore nodes predicates named uniform resource identifiers uris conjunction xml namespace standard allow object identifiers globally unique 
standards allow predicate vocabularies defined give standard names relationships name published predicates correspond concepts easily expressed natural language fact start ternary expression representation language nearly decades simplifies translation rdf statements

annotation predicate specifies relationship annotated object annotation 
possible predicates include description connects document factual summary synopsis reply connects document annotation annotation serves response original document 

annotation body consists natural language text 
text analyzed start forms basis system natural language querying capabilities 
annotation text parsed syntactic structures linguistically sophisticated machinery synonymy hyponymy ontologies structural transformation rules brought bear question answering process 
linguistic techniques allow approach achieve capabilities simple keyword matching handling complex syntactic alternations involving verb arguments 

type annotation 
possible types include reminder suggestion problem complaint idea plan 
annotation types provide way people classify annotations aid browsing retrieval relevant objects 
annotations saved rdf stores haystack storing personal corpora kind annotea storing shared information 
natural language search engine require access rdf store order properly index search require natural language annotations extracted stored internally case start 

user interface expressiveness data model realized exposed user properly 
best way provide ubiquitous support annotations annotation process intrinsic part user interface 
shows screenshot haystack depicting annotation pane 
users create description comment annotations pane view annotations 
annotations created right clicking object screen 
interface supports standard notion threaded annotation discussions built annotations serve replies annotations 
support annotation type metadata associated annotations incorporated 
developed infrastructure support needed pervasive annotations currently developing support querying 
queries may include elements natural language text annotation metadata annotation type annotation predicate date creation annotator envision system able answer queries wanted remember meeting danish customers

queries span multiple rdf stores annotation servers semantic web result haystack support integrating disparate information sources 

proposed online annotation systems useful tools collaboration effective means retrieving documents finding items interest semantic web 
outlined ontology describing annotations rdf described initial efforts integrate support creating searching annotations haystack 
believe natural language support crucial element annotation framework 
leveraging start natural language system allow users locate relevant information simply specifying query everyday language
