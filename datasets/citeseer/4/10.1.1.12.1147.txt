philipp nig ries michael klein unfortunately general cooperative behavior implicates increased resource consumption interest autonomous devices 
case information sharing confronted additional disc accesses growing processor load 
lower network layers increased usage bandwidth energy node forwarding packages prevent necessary benevolent cooperation 
mobile devices commonly wireless environments especially concerned saving device inherently scarce resources 
external incentives cooperation indispensable 
incentive schemes designed order discourage uncooperative behavior time account high heterogeneity devices resulting asymmetry cooperation fact devices may valid reasons lack cooperation cell phone just able offer certain service case punished incentive scheme

assume conceptual layering suffices order exemplify misbehavior cooperation domains 
comprehensive listing misbehavior 
link 
link layer provides peer peer links devices reach 
protocol entity ensures packet waited may turn receive state upper protocol entities act agent 
network 
general network layer offers simple datagram service multiple links 
apart failure forward packets misbehavior varies network protocol 
table driven routing protocols network protocol entity may fail send packets 
connection oriented network protocols entity may refuse participate routing 
network protocol entity establish connections send superfluous packets wasting resources 
transport 
transport layer provides reliable links devices 
transport protocol entity handle connection management lazily omitting connection releases datagram reception 
discovery 
discovery layer application services advertised service provider requests application services processed 
topologies routing matching advertisements requests conceived maintained 
existing approaches discovery layer employ different topologies research project diane hierarchical rings multi layer clusters 
discovery protocol entity may drop uninteresting advertisements fail participate topology maintenance shut prior sign 
entity frequently send advertisements application services 
case memory shortage stores entities advertisements frequently issues requests 
failure forward advertisements entity may alter competitors advertisement

application

philipp nig ries michael klein selfish behavior profitable profitable misbehavior misbehavior agent principal uncooperative behavior unreasonable behavior uncooperative behavior unprofitable malicious behavior fig 

taxonomy uncooperative behavior reasonable taxonomy uncooperative behavior 
defined reasonable uncooperative behavior due resource shortage 
persistent resource shortages arise limitations device limitations computation memory bandwidth energy capacity 
transient resource shortages due device environment usage patterns 
device experience connectivity problems resources overloaded routing bottleneck 
wireless information systems exist protocol entities inherently principal agent entities 
stems asymmetry regard network topology devices resources usage patterns 
asymmetry closely related problem incentive schemes assume principal entity acted agent entity 
incentive scheme exempt punishment 
important able distinguish unreasonable uncooperative behavior misbehavior 
malicious behavior unprofitable misbehavior exhibited profitable protocol entity upper layer 
instance reputation incentive scheme posting packets requires resources profitable network protocol entity 
application protocol entity profits competing service provider excluded network due bad reputation 
generally speaking protocol entities subject moral hazard known agency theory 
profitable uncooperative behavior may exhibited principal agent entity 
principal entity may consume services send superfluous datagrams 
agent entity may fail commit action order resources 
instance network protocol entity may fail forward packets 
cooperation domain protocol entity experiences exhibit uncooperative behavior 
effective uncooperative behavior requires vertical interaction protocol entities 
instance upper layers protocol entities inform malicious protocol entity target 
hand selfish protocol entity stimulating cooperative behavior autonomous devices take account upper layers cooperation patterns 
example link protocol entity able save energy turning ready receive state network protocol entity wait message 
incentive schemes introduce means uncooperative behavior 
instance malicious behavior especially attractive remuneration agent entity flexible regard resources market position

depending incentive scheme trust constitutes incentive cooperation prerequisite remuneration mechanisms 
trust subdivided principal entity perspective agent entity perspective 
hand principal entity ensure agent entity acts specified 
furthermore agent able alter duplicate remuneration 
hand agent entity sure remuneration valid 
distinguish extremes trust static dynamic trust 
practice trust mechanisms take advantage 
static trust refers statement trust certificate remains valid explicitly revoked issuer 
trust transitive entity trusts entity certificate chain trust significance certificate chains discussed 
example manufacturer devices may issue certificate trustworthiness devices protocol entities 
general protocol entity implicitly trusts device manufacturer 
addition manufacturers cross certify protocol entities devices trust 
general philipp nig ries michael klein static trust implemented framework public key infrastructure 
apart authentication infrastructure comes mechanisms enforce integrity non repudiation importance robustness 
downside deployment operation public key infrastructure place high demands devices 
contrast certificates dynamic trust arises prior experiences entity continuously changes behavior 
dynamic trust entity entity experience entities experience order allow needs way learn experiences 
achieved mechanisms diffusion reputation sniffing overhearing messages 
transaction 
elementary principal agent cooperation consists phases 
negotiation phase participants agree agent action assess arbitrary remuneration 
processing phase agent executes action 
negotiation remuneration standard approach overcoming asymmetry topology resources usage patterns 
instance routing expensive overloaded parts network 
remuneration action negotiated regard cost profit ratio principal agent 
processing consists action remuneration 
processing transaction required atomic 
agent executes action action remuneration takes place 
unfortunately atomicity enforced common transaction techniques assume cooperative behavior 
action remuneration separable subactions risk unfairness considerably lowered interleaving action remuneration 
general remuneration granularity finer feasible 
instance principal may turn half remuneration agent action 
downside separation subactions generally implies additional overhead 
lower cooperation domains network link layer actions lower value 
overhead low value transactions considerable 
example forwarding packet network layer may implicate packets forwarding protocol entity immediately 
promising aggregate actions 
prerequisite principal actor participate transactions 
aggregation rendered flexible flow control mechanisms applied 
instance outstanding may managed sliding window 
context flow control constitutes dynamic trust mechanism 
particularly important immediate remuneration infeasible 
sniffing 
generic protocol mechanism sniffing allows collection dynamic information ad hoc network 
certain circumstances enables observation entity behavior 
context incentive schemes sniffing particularly important dynamic trust 
stimulating cooperative behavior autonomous devices link layer sniffing consists listening transmissions destined devices network discovery layer sniffing entities retain content forwarded packets advertisements requests respectively 
shown effectiveness link layer sniffing guaranteed :10.1.1.42.559
