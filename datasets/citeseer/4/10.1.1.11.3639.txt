tim berners lee proposed extension existing world wide web known semantic web berners lee berners lee 
web existing content designed read understood humans readily parsed processed software agents 
central idea semantic web develop machine understandable languages expression semantic content web pages 
promises enhance ability software agents navigate web information space carry tasks humans need sophisticated artificial intelligence 
central semantic web project concept ontology 
web pages conceived composed statements relating objects 
denotations terms making statements need fixed relative particular universe discourse represented ontology 
ontology shared common understanding domain 
ontology usually constructed domain experts 
examine possibility generating ontologies automatically hierarchical conceptual clustering consider certain online ontology discovery semantic web communities methods highly appropriate existing conceptualisation site resources 
important emphasis point concerned generating ontologies behavioural usage data relating resources interest free text data web pages 
aim demonstrate technique may practically implemented overview technologies build semantic web focusing particular basic ontologies represented rdf schema brickley guha 
subsequent sections discuss concept formation system cobweb fisher demonstrate concept hierarchies discovered algorithm represented ontologies rdf schema 
conclude discussion application approach online communities dealing particular smart radio system hayes cunningham developed test bed ideas point research directions 
implementing semantic web uniform resource identifier uri provides foundation web allows give object concept uniquely identifying name 
uris decentralized sense person organisation controls 
create uri inevitably multiple uris representing thing important semantic web provide means resolving names correctly 
provided ontology usually takes form taxonomy defining classes relations 
meaning terms resolved point particular ontologies equivalence relationships defined ontologies 
resource description framework rdf provides means software agents exchange information web 
defines simple model describing relationships web resources terms properties values 
rdf provides means declaring properties 
task left rdf schema represent simple ontologies 
rdf written xml tags important note xml sufficient building semantic web 
xml facilitates arbitrary creation tags annotate web pages 
programmer knows advance tags signify possible write software process web pages automatically 
absence knowledge possible write programs xml builds semantics structures 
rdf hand encodes machine processable structures statements 
rdf see www org addressing overview naming addressing schemes world wide web

represented rdf xml version rdf rdf xmlns rdf www org rdf syntax ns xmlns description org schema rdf description www org home lassila creator ora lassila creator rdf description rdf rdf rdf schema defines collection rdf resources describe properties rdf resources define application specific rdf vocabularies 
rdf schema type system similar type systems objectoriented programming languages java 
purposes sufficient system context example 
consider class hierarchy 
define class 
define subclasses truck van 
define class subclass van 
representing hierarchy core classes properties defined rdf schema 
particular things described rdf expressions called resources considered instances class rdfs resource resource rdf type property value specific class say resource instance specified class schema defines new class resource representing class rdf type property value resource rdfs class rdfs subclassof property specifies subset superset relation classes

hierarchical conceptual clustering data mining extraction implicit previously unknown potentially useful information data 
objective build computer programs automatically detect regularities patterns databases 
useful patterns generalise accurate predictions data 
final objective data mining activity knowledge discovery 
machine learning provides technical basis data mining 
extract information raw data databases 
process abstraction order find patterns 
usually require system provide explicit structural description provide observer explanation learned explanation basis new predictions 
clustering data mining task goal unsupervised classification set objects 
classification unsupervised sense priori target classes training 
clustering techniques rely existence suitable similarity metric objects 
clustering algorithms may classified number criteria 
distance describe clusters purely enumerating members represent clusters means description 
description may take form set necessary sufficient conditions membership cluster may probabilistic description set conditions tenable 
furthermore set clusters may flat sense cluster contained cluster may hierarchical providing taxonomy clusters definite relationships 
cobweb incremental conceptual clustering algorithm represents concepts probabilistically 
initially inspired research basic level effects 
example humans typically verify item bird quickly verify item animal vertebrate robin 
concept birds said reside basic level 
cobweb design assumes principles dictate basic concepts humans heuristics machine concept formation 
ontology discovery semantic web cobweb designed produce hierarchical classification scheme 
carries hill climbing search consists current state search expanding evaluating children selecting best child expansion halting child better parent space schemes search guided heuristic measure called category utility 
category utility metric originally developed gluck predict basic level human classification categories 
adopting criterion evaluating concept quality ai systems fisher notes viewed function rewards traditional virtues held clustering generally similarity ai vij ck ai objects class dissimilarity objects different classes 
cu cn cobweb performs hill climbing search space possible taxonomies uses category utility evaluate select possible categorisations 
initialises taxonomy single category features instance 
subsequent instance algorithm begins root category moves tree 
level uses cu evaluate taxonomies resulting 
classifying object respect existing class 

creating new class 

merging combining classes single class 

splitting dividing class classes 

ontology generation cobweb propose cobweb may automatically generate ontologies

advantages approach sort domain best discussed light fundamental goal semantic web project create environment software agents roaming page page readily carry sophisticated tasks users berners lee 
context online music community tasks going recommendation songs users 
user example request agent finds new songs similar liked past 
request new songs provided ontology discovery semantic web somewhat dissimilar previously encountered may 
ontology facilitates fulfilment requirements similar songs fall concept degrees similarity dissimilarity hopefully captured relationships concepts 
usual way creating ontology domain experts establish fundamental concepts objects relations exist community 
presupposes ontological elements uncovered priori 
domains smart radio clear priori analysis team experts yield sort concepts important recommendation tasks 
songs may categorised artist lesser extent genres sub genres may employed approach inadequate account fact people songs widely divergent artist genre criteria 
algorithms cobweb cluster songs user ratings hope discover structures truly reflective similarities dissimilarities songs 
need evaluate resulting conceptual structures terms impact recommendations need worry users may unable articulate hypothesised perceived similarities dissimilarities songs 
furthermore expect discovered conceptual hierarchy map existing familiar network human concepts 
expect discover structures feasible human experts detect 
advantage conferred automatic generation ontologies cobweb related systems concept formation algorithms incremental sense observations processed en masse 
stream objects processed time 
case smart radio means conceptual hierarchy automatically evolve time new songs added database new users join system 
costly human experts involved capacity evolve time essential constantly expanding online community resource 
may wonder automatically generated ontologies map existing human understandable ontologies fulfil requirement interoperability web sites 
far considered online community held enhanced ontologies turn consideration online communities similar assets case songs exchange information agents site 
traditional ontology engineering collaboration required people run web sites online communities 
different case employing automatic ontology generation techniques 
difference human beings collaborate machines 
smart radio database accessible cobweb agent different database songs user ratings hypothetical smart radio ii accessible agent problem agent constructing maintaining evolving shared ontology sites 
limitation agent able understand structure databases 
collaboration requires set standards conventions construction description databases collaboration entirely spirit semantic web project 
summary ontology discovery semantic web discussed hierarchical clustering algorithms may employed automatically construct basic ontologies illustrated context cobweb rdf schema 
argued approach highly appropriate domains expert knowledge exists proves inadequate gone propose employ software agents collaborate place human beings construction shared ontologies 
benefits recommendation tasks particular allowing evolution concept hierarchies match articulated human conceptual structures hopefully closely reflective criteria people employ rating online assets 
task semantic web project render human understandable resources processable machines say task envisaged extend resources processable machines domain human understanding view helping humans carry online tasks
