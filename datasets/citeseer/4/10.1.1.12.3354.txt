usability small screen www org cdrom papers index html page considerable history research usability small screens including done members group 
quite early interest developing mobile information services reviewing puts current perspective 
early small screen displays starting years ago long web notions mobile information access interest usability information screens smaller conventional computers 
typically displays range quarter half size vga dimensions 
early done readability comprehension information displayed small screens 
interest motivated desire miniature displays devices cash machines atms 
researchers dillon discovered small displays lines text users ability read understand information adversely affected 
established research revisited mobile internet commentators feel mini screens totally inadequate information presentation 
course difference user immediate preferences comments generally reflect user performance actual behaviour turn influence long term preferences 
early office automation devices allowed users select functions choosing options list choices small lcd screen 
research carried consider impact reducing size display 
smaller display fewer options users having scroll list see options shown initially 
users performance terms time select option worsened display size dropped impact dramatic 
real problems occurred display small option displayed time 
research suggests simple lists choices users current small screen mobile devices users able manage struggle example wap phones display line text 
personal digital assistants technology apple newton uk began producing handheld digital information appliances 
tools limited display provided range organising functions diary management contact lists expense management 
display research time focused best limited area increasing functionality devices 
experimented transparent widgets buttons controls displayed top information shown user 
way valuable screen space wasted permanently function controls 
considered schemes similarities framework providing multiple presentations document 
johnson example discusses tool marking information content indicate importance different elements 
screen space reduced system automatically displays important elements 
technique generally called ellipsis 
www org cdrom papers index html page current pdas called handheld computers sophisticated terms graphical capabilities 
researchers investigate ways presenting complex information limited screens early research findings field information visualisation see 
dunlop davidson report presenting database cinema film information palmpilot starfield scheme 
mobile telephone function access mobile telephones networks connected began offer far broader range functions simply making receiving calls 
users divert calls set message boxes change ringing options

briefly review results described different approach short cut codes described

key find letters 
phones vary key allocation relevant approach 
approach navigating complex set menus access functions users simply spell function wished access pressing appropriate numeric keys 
normally words user press key get twice get times get approach key pressed allowed mean initial ambiguity user starts press keys spell function name 
new key press standard computer science technique known hashing system displayed best set function name matches 
example user wished access call divert pressing followed meaning letters function name system display scrollable list containing choices call divert call identification call barring combination keys case abc followed abc started function names battery condition displayed 
soon required function appeared best match list selected directly user input user spell entire function name 
users know exact function name allowed words function name entered order example call divert divert call permitted user probably prefer divert unambiguous 
believed direct systematic approach appropriate devices display input characteristics
