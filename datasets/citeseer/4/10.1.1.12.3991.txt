solar model context aware applications respond context changes adapting new context 
applications active nature actions triggered asynchronous occurrences 
event driven structure context changes rep resented events 
treat sensors contextual data information sources sense physical properties location computational properties network bandwidth 
information source publishes events indicating current state changes state 
sequence events produced event stream 
sensor query interface easily wrapped proxy publisher 
context sensitive applications subscribe event streams interest react arriving events adapt changing environment 
solar represents contextual events list hierarchical attribute value pairs 
internal data structure forest values leaves 
example event current location badge numbered ver may look 
enable application subscribe desired sources solar needs name sources provide flexible mechanism resource discovery services named focus sources 
possibility hierarchical naming scheme unix path names 
example source publishes location badge ver locator versus ver 
strict hierarchical struc ture depends strong convention followed providers users 
syntax may difficult adapt expressive name queries range selection 
limitations hierarchical name space attractive pervasive computing envi ronment 
hand attribute naming scheme flexible expressive order ver location organization dartmouth building sudikoff room location badge veri granularity room rate location event source name badge loc measure location badge ver device camera color true resolution location badge loc location context sensitive name mobile event representation naming mecha nism solar 
attribute value pairs difference 
solar uses hybrid approach keeps values order free allows tree structure attribute names values convenience exactly representation solar events 
name source tracks badge ver shown 
traditionally resource directory fairly static assumes names rarely change registered 
context aware applications may need look names context 
example context aware display may want find nearby cameras 
case physical location part resource description camera may move frequently 
manual updates camera name impossible scenarios 
automatic name updates example attach active badge camera arrange location changes update camera name 
name context sensitive 
challenges involving naming resource discovery context aware applications automatically track associations badge camera handle frequent name updates support persistent name queries applications notified name space changes 
solar uses approach allows name source change context 
solar provides unique way automatically manage context sensitive names defining values contextual attributes output sources computing piece context 
show example context sensitive name mobile camera 
defines source tracks camera location assuming camera badge ver attached defines location attribute camera part location event published specified source 
due space limitations reserve details solar naming system 
operator graph solar simply event delivery system 
solar open platform allow dynamic injection context processing modules shared applications 
observation context aware applications want directly raw data contextual sources 
application needs portion data data wrong format data inaccurate data incomplete useful aggregating sensor inputs 
sensor data typically needs go processing steps meaningful contextual knowledge desired applications 
contextual computation tends result high development cost contextaware applications heterogeneous sources diverse context needed 
hand see adaptive applications ask similar exactly contextual information basics location context high level social context user activity 
natural re overlapping context aggregation functions sub functions applications 
approach decompose context aggregation process application series modular re usable operators object subscribes processes input event streams pub event stream 
typical operators include filters transformers complicated aggregators 
operators accumulated state transformer mapping sensor id room number 
operators may state temperature aggregator publishing highest temperature day 
subscriber view sources operators expose interface event publishers 
publisher named equivalent say output event stream named publisher publishes event stream event stream publisher 
inputs output operator event streams applications tree recursively connected operators starting sources collect aggregate desired context 
application build operator tree scale large number applications take advantage opportunities reuse operators applications operator trees 
open platform solar uses small flexible language allow applications specify operator tree instantiated runtime 
leaves name queries publishers names may match multiple publishers application choose merge event stream name queries resolved different publishers different times depending context 
applications choose name event stream published root operator subscription tree re applications 
interconnected overlapping operator trees form directed acyclic graph call operator graph 
currently solar incrementally builds operator graph new subscription trees added sharing event streams names match 
explore background justification design earlier 
stateful operators may cause complexity shared applications 
consider location aggregator maintains current location objects tracked publishes event object changes location 
active map subscribes aggregator may know location printer moves aggregator information state 
solar allows operator publish special sequence events new subscriber events marked state pushing events considered represent current state operator 
feature reminiscent gryphon expansion operation 
new subscribers receive series events bring date ongoing stream events represent changes current state 
occasionally application may need ongoing event stream simply needs obtain current value 
system application query information source 
operator graph retain publish subscribe abstraction permitting subscriptions stateful operators 
application needs obtain current value information published operator time subscription operator 
operator pushes state described cancels subscription 
time subscription approach avoids need additional maintains unidirectional data flow 
advantages operator graph abstraction context collection aggregation dissemination 
applications receive events semantically closer needs produced sources 
second due modular object oriented design benefit operator re usability data abstraction maintainability 
third due modular design operator graph deployed network achieve benefits parallelism distribution 
fourth filters aggregators dramatically reduce traffic graph edges reduce inter process inter host communication requirements 
sharing common operators event streams system support applications users
