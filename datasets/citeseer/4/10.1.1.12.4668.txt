conclude discussion benefits limitations visualization technique 
related visualization techniques substantial amount research done navigation aids techniques displaying driving walking directions 
driving directions essentially interface arrow sufficient contextual information required route planning supported maps museum guides 
visualization techniques proposed viewing large documents maps limited screen resources 
multi window arrangements overview plus detail visualizations simultaneously display multiple views map 
different scales individual views difficult users integrate map information single consistent spatial mental model require users spend additional time switching views

halo combines advantages approaches listed 
offers single non distorted view allows users inspect detail information losing context 
arrow visualizations halo require additional distance annotation arcs provide full information location screen objects direction 
eliminates need scale indicator distance information encoded arcs refers scale current scene

concept design decisions halo concept halo derives techniques known cinematography theatre 
conventions imply screen space include exit entry points character exiting entering points point view character screen looking screen partially frame part screen prop screen space 
partially frame viewers recognize prop portion object implies rest object screen space 
main difference halo arrow techniques explained classification 
techniques implement point view technique convey directional information 
halo uses partially frame technique attaching screen location prop prop conveys full screen location information 
prop fulfill requirements 
allow viewers mentally fill missing screen parts object viewers know recognize 
second object display features allow viewers understand position space know location attached target 
ring shape halo fulfills requirements 
ring familiar shape furthermore fulfills second requirement extraordinary way ring reconstructed fragment 
tremendous redundancy rings robust various types cropping window border partial occlusion rings 
furthermore humans efficient searching lines higher curvature lines lesser curvature 
rings provide advantage searching closer screen locations 
expected positive impact task completion time tasks striving path length minimization search closest gas station map 
halo implements modified metaphor original concept halo represent screen locations cast light ground map 
metaphor allowed derive important properties halo 
creates aura large artifact allows observers infer lamp existence view 
second aura created map round resulting benefits discussed 
third light overlays objects occluding overlapping multiple lamps aggregate nicely adding light intensities 
forth fading aura distance provides additional visual cue distance 
intense aura indicates lamp located nearby weaker aura indicates distant lamp 
prototype implemented metaphor literally light dark background 
final design undergone modifications 
order easier perceive halo curvature replaced smooth transition aura edges sharp edge 
second minimize occlusion window content overlap replaced disks rings 
third inverted color scheme resulting dark halos light background order better accommodate typical map material light background 
concept fading arcs representing distant locations implemented 
halo renders short arcs represent nearby locations nearly opaque 
longer arcs representing distant location rendered increasing compensates additional visual weight additional length cause 
framework set metaphor series additional design decisions goal maximizing visualization location particularly indication distance central theme halo 
design described subsections introduces third visual cue distance arc length 
intrusion border arc length order limit interference arcs display content halo restricts arcs periphery display 
space outside intrusion boundary shared arcs content space inside intrusion boundary reserved exclusively content 
intrusion border handle space arcs corner arcs halo preference dialog 
scaling intrusion border horizontal drag users assigns space arcs 
rounding corners vertical drag gives extra space corner arcs 
shape intrusion boundary designed arc length serve indicator distance addition curvature opacity 
ideally longer arc indicate represented object away object represented shorter arc circular screen example watch type device easily accomplished circular intrusion border 
arc length depends distance location illustrates arcs representing distance device arc length 
circular display arcs representing distance length 
rectangular display case arcs corners may cropped 
non circular display window achieving correspondence arc length distance represented location requires additional attention 
rectangular intrusion boundary arcs cropped corner display window shorter arcs comparable intrusion depth edge 
accurate solution computing intrusion depth arc basis function desired arc length arcs intrude deeply display window conflicts notion space reserved content 
halo maintains concept intrusion border limiting arc intrusion uses rounded boundary see give extra intrusion depth length corner arcs 
making halo scale large numbers locations arcs mapping similar positions intrusion border may overlap 
general arcs highly robust overlap cases issue 
arcs strongly collocated locations yield arcs large amounts overlap entire length arc halo handles merging strongly overlapping arcs single multi arc 
multi arcs created rendering thinner concentric arcs centered average location 
groups locations indicated thick double ring 
user pans cluster arc overlap decrease targets exactly collocated individually accessible 
second scenarios involving large number screen locations get cluttered number intersections arcs grows quadratically number arcs 
tasks locations represent alternatives halo allows suppressing rendering locations fall certain rank specific relevance threshold 
tasks require users visit targets halo allows showing targets merging arcs multi arcs bottom clustering 
overlapping arcs merge double arc design variables available content visualization halo uses arc shape arc length opacity conveying location information 
means wide range design variables color texture arc thickness remain available communicating additional properties respective screen locations restaurant rating 
applications designers may example choose overload relevance value arc opacity notion relevance may compensate distance map arc thickness map color properties hue
