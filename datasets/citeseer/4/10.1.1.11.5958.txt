hypercup peer peer routing obviously routing networks crucial scaling network 
networks evolve unorganized manner arc prone suffer serious problems limiting number nodes network creating network overload pushing search times unacceptable limits 
schlosser describe hypercup topology networks organizes peers deterministic graph topology featuring symmetry node equally originate searches broadcasts low network diameter limited node degree logarithmic order amount peers network load balancing traffic network 

hypercube dimension arrive constructing hypercube available peers shown 
construct hypercube base dimension dimension set nodes split partitions defined th digit binary encoding node number giving partitions dimensions hypercube neighbors node 
broadcasting topology guarantees node receives messages exactly featuring network diameter logarithmic amount nodes 
searching broadcast limited number nodes efficient reasons 
schlosser provides construction maintenance algorithm permits nodes join leave network arbitrarily number nodes equal low message overhead logarithmic amount nodes network requiring central servers supernodes
