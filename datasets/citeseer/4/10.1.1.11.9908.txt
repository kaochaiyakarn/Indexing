knowledge representation 
commitments accumulate layers commitment representation begins level representation technologies accumulates 
additional layers commitment put technology 
frame structures internist offers illustrative example 
fundamental level decision view diagnosis terms frames suggests thinking terms prototypes defaults taxonomic hierarchy

early description system shows questions answered task hand supplying second layer commitment knowledge base underlying internist system composed basic types elements disease entities manifestations contains hierarchy disease categories organized primarily concept organ systems having top level categories liver disease kidney disease prototypes intended capture prototypical diseases classic case disease organized taxonomy indexed organ systems

third case final layer set choices instantiated diseases included branches hierarchy appear 
questions arise level quite fundamental 
consider example determining considered diseases abnormal states requiring cure chronic fatigue syndrome 
commitment sufficiently obvious sufficiently important subject debate field quite independent building automated reasoners 
similar sorts decisions representation technologies supplies order guess see world offer way seeing don indicate instantiate view 
frames suggest prototypes taxonomies tell things select prototypes rules suggest thinking terms plausible inferences don tell plausible inferences attend
