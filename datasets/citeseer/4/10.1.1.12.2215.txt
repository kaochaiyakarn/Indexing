motivation spatial abilities important component human intelligence 
term spatial abilities covers components spatial perception spatial visualization mental rotations spatial relations spatial orientation 
generally main goal geometry education improve spatial skills 
long term study gl ck positive effects geometry education improvement spatial intelligence verified 
various studies conclude spatial abilities improved virtual reality vr technology 
little done systematic development vr applications practical education purposes field 
fill gap generation virtual reality interfaces mathematics geometry education developing dimensional geometry construction tool called construct high school university education 
system uses augmented reality provide natural setting face face collaboration teachers students 
main advantage ar students see dimensional objects calculate construct traditional pen methods 
thesis working directly space complex spatial problems spatial relationships better faster comprehended traditional methods 
important note geometry education software shares aspects conventional computer aided design cad software glance aims goals fundamentally different 
geometry education software intended generating polished results puts emphasis construction process 
relatively simple geometric primitives operations suffice intended audience age user interface intuitive instructive terms provided visualizations tools 
commercial cad software offers overwhelming variety complex features step learning curve
