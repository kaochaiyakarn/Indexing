just brief account debate primarily eye better understanding pssh 
fuller account situated embodied cognition challenge poses traditional approaches ai see entries embodiment situated cognition situated robotics symbol grounding problem volume anderson forthcoming 
proponents situated embodied approach understanding intelligence pssh suggests picture cognition lines 
symbol system characterized distinctive kind decomposition cognitive functions sensorimotor system independent functions primarily source inputs target outputs reasoning system 
problem solving proceeds terms temporally conceptually distinct steps world sensed input received sensory system model world built plan action formulated computation model action taken output sent motor system 

symbols terms world modeled transformations cognition proceeds meaningful primarily terms internal relations symbols virtue physical relation external objects behavioral dispositions cognitive system particularities physical instantiation 
symbols denote objects aspects environment representative function rests relation denotation 
proponents embodied situated cognition henceforth combined simply sc question intelligent organisms humans included satisfy descriptions 
deny cognition involves reasoning planning humans employ symbols engaging sort reasoning 
suggest reason tip cognitive iceberg rests requires great number substantive cognitive capacities capacities symbolic nature involve states processes tightly coupled proceed interaction environment agent question

get clearest idea mind quote characterization symbol systems length symbol system built set elements called symbols may formed symbol structures means set relations 
symbol system memory capable storing retaining symbols symbol structures set information processes form symbol structures function sensory stimuli produce symbol structures cause motor actions modify symbol structures memory variety 
symbol system interacts external receives sensory stimuli environment converts symbol structures memory acts environment determined symbol structures motor symbols produces 
behavior uenced current environment sensory inputs previous environments information stored memory experiences 
henceforth usually refer symbols symbol structures simply symbols 
symbols patterns

say symbols patterns mean pairs compared system processes pronounced alike erent system behave di erently depending di erent decision 
call patterns symbols designate denote 
information system take symbol token input gain access referenced object order ect ected 
symbols may designate symbols may designate patterns sensory stimuli may designate motor actions
