crucial component infrastructure standardized web ontology language emerging 
article offers pointers emerging area shows ontology languages semantic web lead directly powerful agent approaches realization colleague science fiction vision 
ontology really 
number terms abuse ai community 
terms confusing interact communities web toolkit developers abuse 
term ontology oxford english dictionary defines science study ai usually attribute notion ontology essentially specification conceptualization defined terms relationships usually formal preferably machine readable manner 
complicated relationship ontologies logics 
people treat ontology subset logic treat logic subset ontological reasoning consider terms disjoint 
article employ term currently semantic web circles 
define ontology set knowledge terms including vocabulary semantic interconnections simple rules inference logic partic ular topic 
example ontology cooking includes ingredients stir combine ingredients difference deep expectation products eaten drunk oil cooking consuming forth 
practice useful consider complex logics inference systems separate ieee ieee intelligent systems data document data rules proof logic trust ontology xml name space xml schema unicode resource description framework rdf schema digital signature universal resource indicator

large complex consistent ontologies great numbers users share see great number small ontological components consisting largely pointers 
web users develop components way web content created 
years university government agency ad hoc interest group want web resources linked ontological content powerful tools available content 
information exchanged applications letting programs collect process web content exchange information freely 
top infrastructure agent computing practical 
distributed computer programs interacting nonlocal web resources eventually dominant way computers interact humans 
interaction primary means computation 
vision reality phenomenon similar web early days occur 
web users mark web pages perceive value doing tools demonstrate value developed web resources marked

don claim answers ideas remainder article inspire creation exciting web agent applications 
develop vision step time describing creation pages ontological information definition services machine readable form logics agents provide important new capabilities 
markup free crucial aspect creating semantic web enable users logic ability link browse ontological relations enabled web semantics powerful tool users know ontologies 
experts create machine readable web content 
ideally users shouldn need know web semantics exist 
lowering markup cost isn users free 
semantic markup product normal computer 
current web content small number tool creators web ontology designers need know details users know ontologies exist 
consider known products creating online slide shows 
products contain libraries insert presentation 
software developers mark pointers ontologies 
save html feature include linking products respective ontologies 
presentation pictures example cow linked animals mammals animals forth 
doing guarantee appropriate semantics cow school icon political party retrieval engines markups clues presentations contain linked ones 
user simply creates slide show search tools better job finding results 
alternative example markup tool driven ontologies 
consider page creation tool represents hierarchical class relations menus 
properties classes tied various types forms available simple web forms 
user choose menu add information person choose relative opposed friend professional acquaintance forth daughter 
system semantics retrieve properties daughters specified ontologies display user form filled strings name numbers age browse related links homepage online images photo forth 
system lay appropriate web page design tools recording relevant instance information 
tool driven ontology libraries terms created mixed different ways 
single easy tool allow creation homepages ontologies people hobbies forth professional pages ontologies relating specific occupations industries agency specific pages ontologies relating specific functions 
easy interactive way tool help user create page provide free markup 
mixtures various ontologies forms easily created helping create semantic web pages linking different ontologies mentioned earlier 
incremental ontology creation pages created links numerous ontologies ontologies include links reuse change terms 
notion creating large ontologies combining components unique semantic web vision 
ability link browse ontological relations enabled web semantics powerful tool users know ontologies

expressive logic languages declarative frameworks extend capabilities agents analyze information needs resource requirements processing burden services described 
languages linked cgi scripts procedural techniques agents perform procedural invocation 
run services user intervention allowing general form agent interaction web resources 
service logics defining languages users define structural ontologies current projects including darpa daml initiative exploring extension web ontologies allow rules expressed languages 
efforts vary complexity rules allowed range description logics daml oil language mentioned earlier shoe horn clause rules higher order logics exploratory efforts 
types rules particularly effective connection service classes shows 
service class contains addition service advertisement service description pointer uri containing associated service logic 
logic express information goes information contained service description 
example returning agent replies consider case service offers date picture taken tomorrow particular cost 
rule cost service reached cost represent information actual transfer funds occur reaching particular point service invocation case

agent sends annotated proof agent 
annotations pointers particular fact web ontology particular rule resides 
agent receiving proof analyze check pointers decide trusted computer org intelligent ieee intelligent systems previous agreements check ontology read agree 
lets agent recognize valid transaction occurred allow funds transferred 
service logics serve purposes 
example heterogeneous agent systems discusses deontic logics agent programs multiagent systems 
logics tied appropriate service descriptions represent agent 
logical descriptions services automated matchmaking brokering planning set services achieve user goal capabilities currently discussed implemented multiagent systems 
agent agent communication course having pages service descrip daml languages modern world dynamically changing environment exponentially increasing ability create publish data rapidly human abilities process data information 
agent computing potentially help recognize complex patterns widely distributed heterogeneous uncertain information environment 
unfortunately potential hampered difficulty agents face understanding interacting data unprocessed natural languages 
inability agents understand conceptual aspects web page difficulty handling semantics inherent program output complexity fusing sensor output information name problems truly keep agent revolution happening 
potential solution humans meet computer halfway 
tools provide markup annotations attached data sources information available agents new exciting ways 
goal darpa agent markup language daml program develop language aimed representing semantic relations machinereadable ways compatible current internet technologies 
program currently developing prototype tools show potential markups provide revolutionary capabilities change way humans interact information 
realize goals internet markup languages move implicit semantic agreements inherent xml community specific controlled languages 
darpa leading way daml semantic language ties information page machine readable semantics 
language allow communities extend simple ontologies allowing bottom design meaning allowing sharing higher level concepts 
addition language provide mechanisms explicit represen tions agent programs linked ontologies include links ontologies introduces compelling issues 
shows representation small piece ontological web 
small boxes represent agents web resources terms web ontologies represented larger boxes 
arrows represent mechanism provides mapping full partial ontology 
mapping simple inclusion terms complex sort ad hoc mapping program simply reads terms terms 
shows dag directed acyclic graph taken larger web ontologies 
assuming agents communicating terms ontologies content terms relatively straightforward communicate 
linking ontologies agents commit terms consistently usage mandated ontology 
ontology specifies particular class particular property property restriction agent assume legal values property maintaining restriction 
interesting agents ontologies able communicate 
mappings perfect obviously agent communicate finding common ontology map 
ontologies partially imperfectly mapped 
happen example mary pet shop site 
mary defined site ontology linking back zoo animal ontology changed definitions left untouched 
terms modified modified tation services processes business models allow information encapsulated programs sensors recognized 
daml provide number advantages current markup approaches 
allow semantic interoperability level currently syntactic interoperability xml 
objects web marked manually automatically include descriptions information encode descriptions functions provide descriptions data produce 
doing allow web pages databases programs models sensors linked agents daml recognize concepts looking 
successful information fusion diverse sources reality 
darpa funds development daml help military areas command control military intelligence 
example daml improve organization retrieval large military information stores center army lessons learned 
respect intelligence daml aimed improving integration information sources provide specific indications warnings aimed preventing terrorist attacks military targets year attack uss cole 
ad hoc group researchers formed joint eu committee agent markup languages released new version daml called daml oil

march april computer org intelligent uses uses certain restricted ways mapped couldn ontologies combination extension principle partially mapped trouble 
mind reconsider dag 
clearly agents able find terms share 
agents pointing ontologies terms share sort subset 
case agent able terms significantly changed defined 
agents ones pointing share partial terms ontology changed case 
fact agents share terms take mappings common terms cases 
previous discussion purposely vague regarding mappings 
certain kinds restricted mappings able obtain interesting formal results 
example mappings inclusion links lower ontology includes terms upper find rooted dag set agents guarantee agents share terms worst case share terms uppermost ontology 
mappings ad hoc example sort procedural maps defined hand lose provable properties gain power efficiency 
uses uses uses uses uses 
mappings agents ontologies 
research issues inherent ontology mappings quite interesting challenging 
agents communicate want maximal mappings merged ontology 
agents simply sending single message invocation online service want sort quick fly translation limited terms particular message 
approach large ontologies cyc infer mapping terms agents ontologies
