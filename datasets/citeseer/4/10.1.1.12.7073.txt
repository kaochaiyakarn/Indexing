gate extended provide support importing accessing visualising ontologies new type resource 
functionality provided integration prot editor noy gate visual environment see 
developed gate specific ontology visualisation facilities facilitate process developing testing ontologically aware nlp components see section 
ontology import export provided daml oil 
advantage providing support ontologies gate various nlp modules need uniform way accessing ontologies common api regardless original formats 
similar way gate transparently supports handling multiple document formats enabling modules run large variety texts developers having implement methods data format nlp module 
generating semantic web annotations order allow nlp modules produce results semantic web compatible format implemented daml oil 
takes input user ontology see types annotations exported person organization 
implemented gate processing resource means part gate nlp application export results semantic web 
shown entities different names bush president bush handled 
decision names refer entity handled gate coreference resolution modules dimitrov 
apart handling coreference named entities gate resolves pronoun nominal mentions president compatibility restrictions ontology choosing right antecedent 
example bank kind refer entities kind person 
ontology aware gazetteers illustrate nlp applications benefit semantic web knowledge available gate ontology take gazetteer example show connected ontological resource enriched information processing tasks named entity recognition grammars coreference resolution improve performance 
gazetteer module frequently nlp applications information extraction order annotate occurrences phrases text lists phrases type names cities name indicators 
problem typically types phrases determined ad hoc fashion system developer possible perform reasoning relations types companies organizations phrases annotated companies organizations referred 
modules coreference resolution directly information rely module specific domain ontology 
leads duplication knowledge nlp modules ontology example shown 
updating third party ontologies difficult done module separately 
problems solved having ontology aware gazetteer treats phrases instances concepts ontology language processing modules access ontology perform reasoning information produced earlier gazetteer module obtain semantic distance concepts 
way ontologies shared resources just lexicons 
new gazetteer tied specific ontology ontology management systems ontologies management gate separate nlp modules 
gate components ontologies processing modules easily outside gate standalone part application gate modules integrated prot support knowledge acquisition process annotating automatically texts information companies person names dates 
main issue connecting concepts ontology instances gazetteers nlp 
beneficial process editing gazetteer entries part ontology maintenance 
advantage enables nlp components annotate automatically texts instances available user ontology 
gate user view ontology instances shown separate window edited 
user specify connected gazetteer semantic classes required subsequent components 
shows ontology instance names displayed right list format markup automatically occurrences texts 
list instance names concept shown 
way lists provided gate system simultaneously lists derived instances user ontology 
cases text annotated matching gazetteer list entry coming daml oil annotations generated system ontology annotation provides information ontological class uri ontology 
information subsequent language processing modules query ontology reasoning purposes 
example user set companies entered instances ontology information ontologically aware gazetteers annotate automatically mentions companies text having class 
default gazetteers tools recognise organization extra information ontological class introduced gazetteer classified correctly instance 
nlp modules reason organization super classes 
mentioned allows lists entities provided gate countries cities mapped corresponding class user ontology see mapping definition 
similar example ontological information nlp modules daml oil export 
example list countries mapped class ontology see instances united states classified countries general type location 
order see differences compare daml oil output ontology mapping mapping shown 
ontological information nlp components anaphora resolution gate light weight coreference resolution modules identify names pronouns nominal phrases 
algorithms restricted identify phrases refer named entities try resolve general purpose anaphora resolution modules 
information ontology order verify entities compatible ontological types 
example assume text gordon brown met president bush day connecting user ontology gate gazetteers visit 
said case gordon brown bush recognised persons puts instances ontology 
nominal resolution module resolve president appears title person name easily resolved coreferent bush ontology updated corresponding information 
resolved 
recency ontological compatibility wrongly resolved referring bush entity type person 
updated information ontology possible check bush president presidents generally people profession time 
ontology enables simple reasoning perform anaphora resolution 
processing ontology gate easy understand flexible pattern action language called jape java annotations pattern engine cunningham 
jape rules describe patterns match annotations created result 
jape provides finite state transduction annotations regular expressions 
jape grammar consists set phases consists set pattern action rules run sequentially 
patterns specified describing specific text string annotations previously created modules gazetteer document daml oil export ontological information format analysis 
rule prioritisation activated prevents multiple assignment annotations text string 
example rule specifies words starting uppercase letter followed designator annotated organisation 
rule token kind word token orth lookup type cdg organization lookup annotations created gazetteer lookup module discussed 
case ontological information available gazetteers order assign proper ontological class 
instance designators specified ontology cue words indicating instances class information annotations created pattern classified specifically companies general 
planning extend jape engine take account subsumption relations ontology doing matching left hand side 
example rule look organization followed location order create relationship 
jape takes account subsumption rule automatically apply sub classes organisation
