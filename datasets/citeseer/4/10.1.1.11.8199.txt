germany parsing chunks steven abney bell communications research november intuition read sentence read chunk time 
example previous sentence breaks intuition read sentence read chunk time chunks correspond way prosodic patterns 
appears instance strongest stresses sentence fall chunk pauses fall chunks 
chunks represent grammatical watershed sorts 
typical chunk consists single content word surrounded constellation function words matching fixed template 
simple context free grammar quite adequate describe structure chunks 
contrast relationships chunks mediated lexical selection rigid templates 
occurence chunks determined just syntactic categories sensitive precise words head order chunks occur flexible order words chunks 
describe attempt give content intuitions show parsing chunks distinct processing advantages advantages help explain human parser adopt chunk strategy 
chunks psychological evidence existence chunks 
gee examine call performance structures 
structures word clustering emerge variety types experimental data pause durations reading naive sentence diagramming 
gee argue performance structures best predicted call phrases 
qb phrases created breaking input string syntactic head content word exception function words syntactically associated preceding content word particular object pronouns group preceding content word 
chunks sentence qb phrases 
unfortunately gee undesirable syntactic assumptions 
example assume prenominal adjectives qualify syntactic heads phrases big dog comprise chunk 
gee assign syntactic structure chunks 
remedy deficiencies assume chunk syntactic struc ture comprises connected subgraph sentence parse tree define chunks terms major heads 
major heads content words appear function word content word selects example proud major head man proud son proud major head proud man appears function word content word man selected 
parse tree segments associated sample chunks illustrated cp pp dp vp dp bald man wax hix

heads defined terms syntactic heads follows 
syntactic head phrase content word head function word head head phrase selected parse tree tc chunk subgraph global parse tree root tc highest node head content word defining example man sitting suitcase major heads 
dp highest node head man ip highest node head sitting pp highest node head suitcase 
tc largest subgraph dominated contain root chunk 
parse tree man chunk subtree rooted dp 
parse tree sitting chunk subtree rooted cp entire global parse tree subtrees dp pp excised 
parse tree suitcase chunk subtree rooted pp 
single special case 
terminal nodes excluded chunk inclusion cause chunk discontinuous frontier 
exam ples orphan nodes subject intervenes rest verb chunk prepositions separated rest noun chunk intervening possessor 
example cp pp dp dp vp dp np john sang john house qb phrases generated chunks sweeping orphaned words adjacent chunk 
consequence qb phrases chunks span connected subgraphs parse tree 
example john constitutes qb phrase syntactically phrase john contains unconnected fragments 
correspondence prosodic units syntactic units direct mediated chunks 
qb phrases elements prosodic level representation 
chunks global parse trees elements different levels representation 
global parse trees qb phrases calculated chunks global parse trees qb phrases calculated 
final issue regarding definition chunks status pronouns 
hand clean division grammar chunks grammar relations 
pronouns function syntactically noun chunks particular fill subject object positions consider chunks 
hand generally suggesting treated separate chunks treat separate chunks example 
reasonable solution consider lexical noun phrases assign status orphaned words 
level chunks orphaned words belonging chunk 
level qh phrases swept adjacent chunk 
level syntax treated noun phrase 
position specific adjacent chunk orphaned words swept 
orphaned word takes complement swept nearest chunk direction complement chunk 
swept nearest chunk direction syntactic governor 
example pronouns function words take complements 
best knowledge function words take complements 
subject pronouns swept chunk object pronouns swept preceding chunk

lr stands left right rightmost derivation item np vp 
np dot generates items np np det changes 
item sets control computation follows

example top control stack may shift det suppose shift kernel new item set determined stepping item follows dot

non determinism chunker chunker non deterministic version lr parser just described 
sources non determinism chunker 
points chunks explicitly marked word stream leading ambiguities involving chunks different lengths 
second word may belong category leading conflicts chunker know shift word stack result graph computation path chunker input node snapshot chunker arc parsing action result line tree 
chunker performs best search tree legal computations 
aim best search approach deterministic parsing losing robustness 
success marcus parser similar determin istic natural language parsers fidditch hindle gives cause believe deterministic near deterministic parser english possible 
marcus style deterministic parsing related drawbacks 
complexity grammar development debugging increases rapidly 
believe results partly production rule grammar format partly fact grammatical heuristic information folded indiscriminately 
second parser best initial guess choice point leads dead parser simply fails 
preferable separate heuristic information grammatical information non deterministic architecture 
heuristics improve approach deterministic parsing non garden path sentences 
time sentences genuine garden paths garden paths imperfect heuristics cause parser fail merely slow 
non determinism simulated straightforwardly chunker 
configuration snapshot computation 
configuration number possible actions 
chunker builds task possible action 
task tuple includes current configuration action score 
score estimate task lead best parse 
tasks placed priority queue score 
example suppose simple grammar chunk np chunk vp np vp word sentence water chunker creates tasks sh water np sh vp element task current configuration control parse stacks empty current word word 
second element action performed shift water stack go state np shift water stack go state vp 
final element task score 
tasks placed queue best task queue 
chunker main loop takes best task queue task configuration current configuration 
executes task action producing new configuration 
new set tasks computed new configuration placed priority queue cycle repeats 
continue example executing task yields configuration np 
possible action re np producing single new task 
assuming score better new queue np re np sh vp parser execute reduction task 
scores tasks determined factors 
lexical frequencies 
general category preferences prefer participle prefer modification adjectival modifier 
lr resolution prefer shift reduce 
agreement disagreement produce ungrammaticality score vector length position factor 
values range negative infinity represent log frequency lexical frequency factor number violations factors 
natural order scores partial order partial order embedded total order assigning weights factor wifi sl wifi 
weights currently assigned arbitrarily method fixing empirically clearly de 
desirable best search scores decrease monotonically parse proceeds 
guarantees solution best solution 
task represents tree possible computations 
making scoring function monotonic decreasing assure solutions task scores better score 
solution score task queue task queue score solution solution score solution 
deciding chunk ends problem deciding chunk ends inasmuch ends chunks ends sentences marked text 
general single chunk cover entire input return highly valued chunk covers prefix input 
straightforward way pretend word alternate reading solution score score accept task generated 
input marker 
lr parsers treat input grammatical category albeit special 
input markers position string sounds expensive fact 
piece information keep task input marks subset readings lookahead word task legal 
example suppose just shifted word stack current configuration qp qp sole lr state control stack sole category parse stack word input word 
word say readings 
common reading verb rare reading noun unit measure area 
legal action configuration reduce qp 
qp ultimately modifier head noun 
reduction legal word noun 
noun reading rare task calling reduction qp know keep track subset readings lookahead word legal 
keep sets lookahead readings task slip fake input markers lookahead readings 
operations perform performed anyway reductions legal lookahead fake input marker 
score reductions relatively low prefer longer chunks shorter chunks turns input markers causes execute tasks executed

worst case pro rules number words dictionary
