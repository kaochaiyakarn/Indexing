researchers stated mail spoken communication 
important differences 
example mail normal spoken communication 
mail participants see faces hear voices identify gestures visual cues 
information content mail include simple text markup text convey additional information 
senders mail natural language text formulate content transmitted information users developed electronic para language mark message convey affective socio emotional information 
informal language codes called include intentional misspelling lexical surrogates hmm grammatical markers excessive upper case letters repeated question marks visual arrangements text characters short combinations normal rotated characters resemble facial expressions joy sadness

methods proposed text categorisation 
techniques employ bag words word vector space feature representation learning algorithm decision trees bayesian probabilistic approaches support vector machines classify text document 
mail text classification undertaken researchers context automated mail document filtering filing see example 

authorship attribution studies extensive controversial example authorship federalist papers shakespeare works 
studies employ stylometric features style markers discriminating authors large formal texts source documents 
stylometric features proposed including word character stylometric features function words punctuation exists number different techniques performing discrimination 
include statistical approaches cusum neural networks 
unfortunately exist consensus existence set uniquely discriminatory stylometric features correct methodology mentioned techniques suffer problems questionable analysis inconsistencies set authors failed replication small number studies mail authorship attribution undertaken

mail corpus methodology describe process generating mail corpus selection attributes gender preferential language author categorisation experiment 
briefly describe sampling methodology calculation categorisation performance 

mail corpus generation generation suitable corpus mails study complicated various factors 
firstly process generating mail corpus constrained privacy issues ethical considerations 
possible mails people consent 
unfortunately obtaining person consent impossible exercise 
secondly possible publicly available mail corpuses newsgroups mailing lists easy validate gender sender mail corpus 
example sufficient sender name alias indeterminate spoofed 
thirdly generally difficult obtain sufficiently large clean void cross postings topic spam empty bodied mails attachments corpus mails 
important generate mail corpus biased example particular cohort author language style mail topic may affect categorisation results gender preferential language author attribution experiment 
judicious timeconsuming selection mails model building paramount
