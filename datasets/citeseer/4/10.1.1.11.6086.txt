system combines features expertise expert finders recommender systems fundamental differences expert expertise finder system locate expert special knowledge skill causes person regarded authority specific topic 
quality answer depend explicit knowledge search cases peer reviewed supplied experts result consultancy exercise 
expertise systems range centrally held database personnel skills searching limited range personally selected documents systems real time information held corporate system recommender system extension basic expertise finder approach results modified feedback provided previous users quality validity recommendations 
view resource locator looks information repositories organisation needed outside organisation locate suitable resources resolve specific query 
recommender systems results query personalised user example job function status

newman investigated searching scientists collaboration networks built mainly document 
argues true collaboration networks affiliations people memberships clubs teams organisations 
expert finder projects mitre aim provide online search facility searching experts organisation 
expert finder identifies experts certain topics searching database variety documents authored submitted employees 
system person considered expert certain field name associated documents specific subject 
type association documents type employee researcher administrative staff indicates degree expertise 
constructs social networks projects publications technical interactions applies statistical clustering techniques social network analysis bring people similar skills interests 
experts rated network connectivity relevant projects documents related experts 
project means knowledge enhanced search ontologies investigated 
mcguinness describes tool deployed uses ontologies improve search perspectives recall precision ease query formation 
tool mainly targeted information retrieval research area aims improve search engines technology 
provide means updating topic sets categorize information 
addition ontologies team notion evidence phrases uncover hidden information related topic 
example evidence topic internet telephony 
system elaborates approach cue phrases evidence abstraction topic 
similar system ontoseek 
deploys content matching techniques support content access web 
project target information retrieval area aim improving recall precision focus specific classes information repositories yellow pages product catalogues 
underlying mechanism uses conceptual graphs represent queries resources descriptions 
graphs constructed automatically 
ontoseek team developed semi automatic approach user verify links different nodes graph designated userinterface 
uses ontologies area include skills management discussed discussed

author elaborates requirements building systems large organisations prototype system 
design issues designing resource locator systems rely gathering wide range information different locations outside organisations making accessible number issues addressed system continuously update information individual resources resources created revised eliminated users resources system take account different perspectives resource providers users provide required information relevant users system keep balance enabling discovery information distributed environments ensuring provision resource locator collects combines information order provide appropriate user interaction 
requirements lead system design complex needs take account interactions subsystems change time 
implementation agent approach demonstrates number features support requirements 
firstly order deal distributed heterogeneous resources necessary reduce effort time needed combining maintaining resources 
decomposing sources configurable components easily incorporated eliminated treating individual agents possible build scalable system 
similarity information sources operate similar context allowing unique features captured 
secondly order build centralised resource locator adding workload users learning capability automatically allows changes resources tracked necessary reported study agent approach suitable prompt adaptation crucial 
architecture dependent ontologies retrieve infer necessary information searching locating resources 
ontologies provide systems classifications topics people roles events sorts activities relevant locating resources organisations 
information user example help expert search similar roles job categories user short social paths user encourage response 
hierarchy topics narrow broaden query results respectively 
furthermore ontology relations valued differently searching resources gaining control process obtaining tuned results 
social networks shown important role people finder applications 
approach intend treat ontology assertions social network analyse infer variety information hub authoritative people communities practice shortest paths

emnlp potential information resources resource discovery agent exploit mail messages exchanged companies different organisational departmental groups outside organisations 
types content messages carry task discussion action decisions business rules particularly important organisational task analysis 
contextual information inherently included exchanged messages example names communicators time information enables extracted user information easily attached context specific properties important creating expertise models 
emnlp example expertise modeling mail communication 
emnlp examines application nlp natural language processing technique user modeling development expertise modeling mail communication 
captures different levels expertise reflected exchanged mail messages expertise facilitating correct ranking experts 
linguistic perspective regards exchanged messages realization verbal communication users assumption user expertise best extracted focusing sentence users viewpoints explicitly expressed 
addition names structures mail folders discovering user interests regard message content 
supporting assumption folder names tend show information needs users associate meaningful concepts names described
