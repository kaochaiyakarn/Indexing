summarizing neonatal time series data sripada ehud reiter jim hunter jin yu department computing science university aberdeen aberdeen csd ac uk describe investigations generating textual summaries physiological time series data aid medical personnel monitoring babies neonatal intensive care units 
studies suggest summarization communicative task requires data analysis techniques determining content summary 
describe prototype system summarizes physiological time series 
time series data ubiquitous measurement humans period time produces time series 
building system summarize physiological times series data heart rate blood pressure measured neonatal intensive care units 
background sumtime project aims develop generic techniques produce textual summaries time series data sripada 
initially worked domains meteorology gas 
meteorology generate textual weather forecasts weather data wind speed wind direction wave heights 
gas generate textual summaries unexpected patterns sensor data exhaust temperature liquid fuel flow turbine speed 
domains working industrial collaborators built prototype systems

physiological parameters heart rate mean blood pressure temperature recorded second frequency various probes attached baby 
order monitor health babies medical personnel doctors nurses working neonatal unit required inspect data continually 
currently visual displays data 
system generate textual summaries data aid medical personnel 
believe interpreting textual summaries lot quicker require mathematical statistical knowledge compared interpreting graphical displays 
knowledge acquisition carried variety knowledge acquisition ka activities multiple techniques developed expert system community scott clayton gibson understand humans perform data summarization

human written summary data shown 
ka studies number observations neonatal data summarization 
raw data contains number artifacts due external events baby handling blood sampling 
artifacts need separated input data summarizing 
example data shown contains blood sampling artifact 
summaries report rises falls data 
summaries report actual numerical values parameter summarized 
artifact separation required domains unique neonatal data 
experts ka explained physiological data artifacts reflect true physiology underlying baby 
explained artifact data interesting right summarized separately summaries show underlying baby reacting external actions 
interestingly general observations data summarization domains 
summarization needs domain knowledge reflecting data 
domain neonatal care form knowledge artifacts 
domain meteorology form knowledge important 
example changes wind speeds directions important marine forecasts public forecasts gales predicted

content selection segmentation important question summarization data points input included summary model summarization needs find ways reduce size input data set improve accessibility significantly altering content informativeness 
process sensitive domain constraints limits parameter values 
clear studies data summarization earlier studies shahar boyd data summarization needs data analysis determine trends patterns data set

sumtime sripada segmentation input weather data determine intervals similar trends 
manual inspection corpus texts felt segmentation neonatal data 
segmentation process fitting linear segments input data series keeping maximum error introduced segments lower user defined value

segments joining smaller values different error limit compared join larger values 
user defined limits thresholds control segmentation process way suited summarization 
general data analysis algorithms segmentation need adapted suit summarization requirements sripada 
initial prototype assumed variety control values produced output summaries

observed domain meteorology include information related significant intervals summary 
neonatal domain need obtain domain specific knowledge identifying significant segments intervals 
initially bp stable

interested producing purely descriptive textual summaries neonatal data 
human written summary shown includes interpretative parts interwoven descriptive parts 
producing interpretative summaries data requires lot expert domain knowledge 
current want get building specialist domain knowledge 
planned experiments plan conduct small pilot tests software get general feedback useful summaries 
performed ward involve small number doctors looking generated summaries suggesting improvements revisions making general comments 
experimental evaluation system fully developed proper experimental evaluation 
example set kind diagnosis task doctors examine data particular baby diagnose wrong baby say baby particular problem 
ask group doctors task just graphic visualizations graphic visualizations text summaries see significant difference accuracy time diagnosis confidence decision
