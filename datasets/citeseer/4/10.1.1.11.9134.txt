research hand gesture recognition static dynamic assumes gesturing hands segmented background basis simple cues color motion disparity 
argue complex natural environments case 
system zhu achieves results segmenting hand static images cluttered background 
method requires hand cover large portion image prior knowledge position hand needed 
requirements difficult meet applications 
appears segmentation achieved independently recognition 
main strength approach rely separate segmentation stage finding object boundaries closely integrated recognition 
suitable situations complex backgrounds segmentation decoupled recognition 
deny motion color processing important cues helping segmentation recognition process 
additional color features shown significantly improve system 
experiments described recognition result input image simply graph giving highest similarity 
applications necessary address situation hand may image significance match evaluated 
simple effective method achieve compares similarity best graph distribution similarities graphs 
idea match best graph sufficiently better graphs match accepted 
details approach ref 

demonstrated applicability approach creating gesture interface autonomous robot 
robot operates pick place scenario 
user points objects different hand postures indicate object pick pick put 
coarse localization tracking pointing hand done simple robust scheme integrating motion color disparity cues 
system uses slightly different set gestures suitable particular application model graphs fewer nodes system fast interaction human operator 
system performed successfully numerous demonstrations 
main problem current approach large geometric variations different instantiations posture 
variations require bunch graph greatly distorted 
reducing topological costs big distortions graph possible node easily reach number false targets performance worse 
needed way adequately representing distortions different instantiations posture 
promising approach may model graph distortions principal component analysis demonstrated faces lanitis 
require hand labeling image correspondences bigger training set 
showed faces space typical deformation patterns learned relatively small set labeled face landmarks large gallery unlabeled faces 
promising idea hierarchical object graphs allow different sources geometric distortions different finger shapes sizes versus different relative positioning fingers compensated suited hierarchy level 
idea regarded compromise purely viewbased technique model technique method employing kinematic model hand 
weakness approach high computational complexity 
current method requires seconds analyze single image special hardware 
hierarchical hand posture models share constituent parts hand may provide substantial benefits
