weakness reusable password systems choice password 
commonly example consider unix password system current password mechanism cryptographic transformation fixed string zero bits user supplied password key 
transformation normally altered version des encryption performed times 
transformation sufficiently slow exhaustive keyspace attacks currently practical fast implementations exist perform tens thousands comparisons second 
unix encrypted version password traditionally kept world readable file safety passwords protected time complexity exhaustive attack 
factors safety unix passwords large potential keyspace passwords 
full character set character passwords chosen number potential passwords searched far large successfully searched high speed 
assuming usable character set characters possible passwords length 
attempts second exhaustive search keyspace require years complete 
unfortunately unix systems users select passwords exploit large keyspace available 
choose common words names simple transformations names 
greatly simplifies attacker task common words searched 
basic methods system administrator enforce better reusable password security computer system 
educate encourage users better choices passwords 

generate strong passwords users allow choose passwords creation 
done random password generator 

check passwords fact force users change easily broken dictionary attack 

screen users password choices prevent weak ones installed 
unix trademark unix system laboratories method educating users choose strong passwords environments significant number novices turnover high 
users understand importance choosing strong passwords novice users best judges obvious instance novice users mistakenly may believe reversing word capitalizing letter password strong matter education may users may forget may believe significant follow guidelines leading transient long term 
problem education provided users select password dangerous 
instance education provided gives users specific way create passwords letters favorite phrase users may exact algorithm making attack easier 
second method strengthening passwords generate passwords users allow opportunity select weak password 
mechanism passwords need randomly drawn keyspace 
unfortunately method flaws 
particular random mechanism chosen truly random analyzed attacker 
furthermore random passwords difficult memorize especially changed aged regularly 
result users may write passwords providing opportunity intercept effort dictionary search 
third method preventing poor password choice scan passwords selected chosen see weak 
supported systems including crack cops significant problems approach dictionary search may comprehensive catch weak passwords 
outside attackers scan choices system password scanner include search 
scanning approach takes time fast implementation 
lucky determined attacker may able penetrate system weak password discovered scanner 
especially problem environment large number users systems 
output scanner may intercepted system 
additionally correlation finding weak password getting replaced stronger 
academic business government settings difficult impossible force higher level managers change passwords 
fourth method disallowing choice poor passwords place appears drawbacks mentioned 
difficulties associated 
particular storage required keep sufficiently large dictionary may prevent method workstations small computer systems 
instance standard unix dictionary usr dict words words bytes space 
dictionary times size necessary reasonable protection words webster new world dictionary occupy bytes disk storage 
include slang colloquial words phrases include user names local names phrases words foreign languages strings shown poor password choices 
moderately comprehensive dictionary password research entries requires bytes storage 
full fledged collection dictionaries including words foreign languages proper names atlas collection slang terms occupies megabytes storage 
maintaining large dictionary difficult 
add new words phrases means dictionary additional space overhead indexing sorted addition lookups take time proportional length dictionary 
small computer environments alternatives may appropriate
