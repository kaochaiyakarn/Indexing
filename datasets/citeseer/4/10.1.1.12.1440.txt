organization bookmark archive users organize bookmark archive fight entropy add structure 
helps reduce retrieval time enables user collaborate users sharing structured archive 
large bookmark archives unwieldy organized 
organizing bookmarks top web usability problems reported survey respondents 
users continually tradeoff cost organizing bookmarks remembering bookmarks folders versus cost having deal disorganized set bookmarks 
optimize cost structure information environment small amount information available low cost larger amounts available higher costs 
users cost tune archives expending amount effort needed build structure support fast retrieval useful bookmarks

retrieval hierarchy bookmarks comments survey respondents showed bookmark users find difficult manage large number bookmarks 
bookmark hierarchy created incrementally somewhat informally time place enforces rigid structure 
users remember bookmarks stored structure 
finding item deeply nested hierarchy challenging users 
labeling bookmarks tended problem bookmarks descriptive aren great actual content web page 
respondents reported scale problem significant problem titles problem mean std 
users reported change name bookmarks 
may due lack tools traditional difficulties naming items 
bookmark pointer web page modified time content change warning urls invalid 
user wrote easily tell bookmark obsolete url changed page disappeared link checker 

design implications interpretation results bookmarking rational process transfers knowledge head knowledge world 
users deal number tradeoffs concerns bookmarking including worth making bookmark probably infrequently 
time taken organize bookmarks current cost worth benefit 
bookmarking behavior change number bookmarks increase 
folders begins bookmarks multi level hierarchies prevalent archives bookmarks 
users bookmarks offload database invent creative organizational schemes 
users archives bookmarks tend motivated organize share resulting index urls 
users expend significant effort required maintain growing archive value user personal information space breaks 
entropy creates disorder archive complex information space 
www dominant global information resource new compelling web sites emerge users need bookmark management systems scale manage growing archives 
consideration results leads design recommendations fundamental areas organization visualization representation integration 
organization users need scalable tools bookmarks pile fast unmanageable 
minimize effort needed organize bookmarks build hierarchies 
place prescribed folder easily mouse click 
systems provide users immediate filing mechanism bookmarks filed creation time avoiding buildup disordered bookmarks 
users hate having sort bookmarks folders systems provide automated sorting capabilities hierarchies organized context browsing session 
metaphor managing bookmarks folders 
bookmarks organized usage patterns users easily cost tune archives 
example users order bookmarks frequency 
commonly bookmarks stored pull menu navigation archival bookmarks stored separately longterm retrieval 
visualization poor visualization hampers users large archives 
problem get bookmarks screen 
bookmark management systems provide ways visualizing large numbers bookmarks aid retrieval 
research showed visualization directly affects organizational habits create folders pull fills screen limit approximately items 
example user wrote folders way browsing 
visual clutter results pollution growing archive 
bookmarks don list 
designers investigate time visualization automated filters display large numbers bookmarks 
representation bookmarks represented texts defaults title respective web site 
consequently bookmarks aren great actual content web page 
systems allow users easily rename bookmark created difficult change name descriptive 
multiple representations help users visualize large archive 
currently limited information top level listing bookmarks difficult find bookmarks 
user suggested short descriptive title available top level 
designers investigate contextual information representing bookmarks bookmark surrounding hypertext cluster 
integration really bookmark organizer doesn demand exit browser 
integrated bookmark management system fit naturally web browser 
user suggested tight coupling bookmarks search engines tend collect organize resources batches 
interface search queries bookmarks nice 
bookmarks collaborate users publish information tools combine hierarchy formation web page authoring aid organizing viewing bookmarks 
users computer need ways integrating multiple lists 
example single bookmark file multiple platforms 
need nfs bookmarks 

bookmarks serve starting points hypertext exploration 
created stored archival purposes visited months 
users weigh costs organizing bookmarks expected gains 
bookmarking takes place context users ongoing information requirements assessment important current bookmarks 
advantage users maintain bookmarks single list see bookmarks screen time 
strategy minimizes current effort 
number bookmarks increases users typically employ sophisticated organizational strategies hierarchies folders 
results indicate sizable proportion users organize bookmarks backlog unorganized bookmarks accumulated 
proactive organization bookmarks tends occur people large numbers bookmarks 
users bookmarks tend file time creation keep date archive order manage bookmarks 
users benefits todate organizational structure outweigh distraction browsing required file bookmark 
study questionnaire analysis bookmark files obtain initial assessment bookmarks archived 
questions remain answered happens people try manage hundreds thousands bookmarks 
results depend bookmark management capabilities browser 
results hold larger samples users taken broader populations users 
functions bookmarks serve 
example mental maps study users suggests users may create bookmarks personalize web structure cloud unmapped resources terms familiar landmarks study needed 
increasing importance web role general repository information understanding bookmarking process developing appropriate tools organizing large numbers bookmarks pressing issues 
research lays empirical foundation study web user behavior design bookmark management systems
