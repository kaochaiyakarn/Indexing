brevity arp protocol specification pages testament elegant simplicity arp design 
longevity specification years attests arp suitability address resolution problem 
arp incorporates distinct goals single protocol neighbor discovery determining network peer neighbor address resolution establishing mapping link layer addresses network layer addresses 
neighbor discovery neighbor discovery nd primitive multihop routing built 
route data network necessary node route aware existence hop 
separately characterize flavors nd information positive negative 
positive nd provides indications neighbor new neighbor come range communication 
negative nd indicates previous neighbor left neighborhood leaving communication range crashing 
different mechanisms provide varying flavors nd example overhearing transmission neighbor positive nd indication absence transmissions necessarily negative nd indication 
address resolution inter networking protocol ip independent specific choice link layer technology 
consequently mechanism maps ip addresses link layer addresses necessary transmit datagrams ip peers attached multiple access link neighbors refer problem address resolution ar 
arp operation pure protocol view arp simple

single exchange pair packets nodes learn node neighbor discovering link layer addresses 
crux problem lies pure protocol specification integrated real network stack 
system perspective arp reasons 
systems desire negative nd positive 
negative nd useful situations mobile nodes wireless networks may move transmission range

arp implementations derived original bsd unix arp buffer single packet neighbor ar ongoing 
additional packets arrive neighbor replace buffer contents ar process completes

manet routing goal manet routing protocols determine multihop route ad hoc network source destination live long deliver data packets 
protocols establish routes proactively maintaining routes possible destinations reactively establishing routes response data demand 
infrastructure routing protocols traditionally delegate nd arp dynamicity manets requires ad hoc protocols maintain finer grained control nd

routing protocols incorporate concept link layer notification popular ieee specification link layer notify protocol failure id arp tex exp deliver packet assumed neighbor

manet routing protocols cheaply provide ar service service provided arp eliminated system entirely 
manycast conflict ideal implementation manycast manet routing protocols course differs proactive reactive routing protocols

reactive protocols approach slightly complicated 
reactive protocols perform nd demand route request reply packets propagated network negatively timeout response link layer notification packet delivery failure 
reactive protocols perform automatic ar provided route request reply packet received possible determine network layer address previous hop packet 
assume link layer source address received packets available routing protocol 
source routed protocol dsr automatic ar trivial previous hop network address clearly indicated source route attached request reply 
claim demand routing protocol propagates requests hop propagates replies backward discovered route perform automatic ar 
note hop hop propagation implies received route request packet previous hop network layer address ip source address field route reply minimum indicate ip address hop route necessarily previous hop transmitter reply packet 
provided network link layer addresses neighbor relaying route reply routing protocol maintain arp cache entries parallel route discovery 
routing protocol receives request reply updates arp cache entry neighbor ensuring entry discovered route consequently neighbor forward packets 
proactive reactive handling negative nd update timer expires threshold number periodic updates missed link layer notification provides indication similar 
routing protocol decides previous neighbor moved away delete neighbor arp cache entry maintain freshness cache 
key concept approach ensure neighbor knowledge represented set routes particular neighbor hop ar information share fate 
ensures neighbor link layer address known unicast communication neighbor necessary 
note additional communication resources automatic ar necessary ar information available routing protocol simply advocate routing protocol take maximum advantage data 
automatic ar require additional overhead reduces overhead eliminating exchange arp packets 
general automatic ar applicable routing protocol discovers existence neighbors ip addresses receiving packets neighbors
