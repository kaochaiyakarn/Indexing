process setting collecting icsi meeting corpus involved decisions 
purpose describe data corpus reasons chose particular approach 
section discuss high level decisions regarding meeting types participants equipment sections describe audio section information section speaker information section transcripts section 
finish section related section acknowledgments section 
decisions early process record natural meetings meaning meetings taken place anyway 
option meetings people asked discuss particular topic solve problem play game result decision clear bulk meetings people international computer science institute icsi set recording room 
possible convince people move regular meeting new location far easier simply record meetings occurred room nearby 
recordings regular group meetings research groups icsi 
consequently speakers appear meetings 
examples topic 
see sections information meeting types speaker demographics 
key decision simultaneously record head worn microphones desktop microphones 
introduces unnatural component meeting wearing mi felt crucial 
near field signals allow separate far field acoustic effects language dialog effects 
second provides high quality baseline human transcription 
speech activity detection easier signal mic participant head quite strong compared signals neighboring mics 
third provides baseline analyzing techniques designed compensate far field effects noise reverberation crosstalk 
allows non acoustic research dialog act analysis proceed penalty poor acoustic signal 
meeting asked participants read digit strings similar 
full task performing automatic speech recognition far field signal unconstrained meeting task quite daunting current accuracy poor 
providing digits data allows research far field acoustic issues additional complexity large vocabulary human human interactions 

audio meetings took place conference room icsi 
room seats approximately people long thin table 
projection screen located room 
projector seldom fan active recordings 
meeting simultaneously recorded head worn microphones desktop omni directional pzm microphones dummy pda containing inexpensive microphones 
pzm microphones arranged staggered line center conference table pda placed roughly center table 
earlier meetings single lapel style microphone head worn microphones 
problems background noise crosstalk hearing neighboring voice lapel channel stopped lapel mic early data collection 
moved wireless system head worn microphones 
expensive solution allowed participants move room eliminated common hardware faults broken connectors 
waveform channel stored separate file 
data sampled fly khz khz encoded bit linear nist sphere format 
software gain setting controlled available bits sample 
chose khz bits reduce data storage requirements higher quality settings appear necessary automatic speech recognition systems 
file compressed lossless algorithm 
obtained compression near field signals contain large amount silence 
example minute meeting participants takes gigabytes disk space uncompressed actual compressed meeting takes gigabytes disk space
