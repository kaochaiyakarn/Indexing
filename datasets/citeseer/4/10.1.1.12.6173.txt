gnutella people wish gnutella network download gn develop gn application adheres gnutella protocol 
application acts client consumer information server supplier information high level network connecting routing information clients servers 
instance application called peer 
peer interchangeably host discussion 
gnutella number features attractive certain users 
example gnutella provides anonymity masking identity peer generated query 
additionally gnutella provides mechanism ad hoc networks formed central control 
central servers gnutella network order join system user initially connects known hosts available generally provide shared files 
hosts forward ip port address information gnutella peers 
attached network peers interact means messages 
peers create initiate broadcast messages re broadcasting receiving transmitting neighbors 
messages allowed network ping messages essentially message directed host 
pong messages reply ping 
pong message contains information peer ip address port number files shared total size files 
peers forward kind message neighbors possible find peers 
needed case disconnect network 
query messages messages stating am looking get forwarded entire network theoretically 
query messages uniquely identified source unknown 
query response messages replies query messages include information necessary download file ip port location information 
responses contain unique client id associated replying peer 
messages propagated backwards path query message originally took 
messages broadcast impossible trace query responses system 
get push messages get messages simply request file returned query 
requesting peer connects serving peer directly requests file 
certain hosts usually located firewall unable directly respond requests files 
reason gnutella protocol includes push messages 
push messages request serving client initiate connection requesting peer upload file 
peers located firewall connection impossible 
features gnutella protocol prevent messages re broadcast indefinitely network 
feature includes short memory messages routed peer preventing re broadcasting 
additionally messages flagged time live ttl field 
hop re broadcast ttl decremented 
soon peer sees message ttl zero message dropped re broadcast 
free riding gnutella analysis consider types free riding

experiments described address kinds free riding 
experiments section describe experiments test hypotheses hypothesis significant portion gnutella peers free riders 
hypothesis free riders distributed evenly different domains speed network connections 
hypothesis peers provide files download necessarily files downloaded 
measuring downloads features attract users gnutella difficulty associating queries particular peer user 
query message virtually impossible large percentage peers collude find peer originated query 
unfortunate side effect property impossible experimentally measure number queries files downloaded client 
forces assumptions downloads order measure 
possible assumption users share high number files downloaded share download 
case free riding 
possible assumption users files try access 
fewer files user download resulting free riding 
unfortunately way knowing extremes closest reality assume truth

sites rank ordered sorted number files offer left right 
results indicate approximately peers share files share files 
nat allows hosts share files sharing host downloading host nat addresses transaction completed 
number nat hosts network increases number completed transactions decreases 
hosts nat trivial 
approach turns transactions 
intentional free riding important consider 
probabilities push zero share statistics 
data shows top percent hosts represent approximately percent total files shared 
quickly top percent hosts sharing files 
table shows values data points 
top share percent hosts hosts hosts hosts hosts hosts table second definition free riding determined hosts provide files hosts provide files downloaded 
attempted capture analyzing query response traffic 
difficulty analyzing data unclear long peer connected network 
assume due large sample network connectivity averages degree 
show bandwidth appears significant effect free riding 
lower bound estimate nat hosts find eliminating hosts provide downloadable files left set hosts 
measured considerable amount free riding gnutella network 
sample set peers approximately provided query response 
hosts theory files share responded queries didn provide desirable files 
illustrates data depicting rank ordering sites versus number query responses host provided 
see rapid decline responses function rank indicating sites bulk 
sharing hosts top percent sites provides nearly answers top percent provide 
shares files 
second experiment verified hypothesis files query responses free riders shared equally different domains 
implication hosts domain contribute hosts domain terms ratio peers network files responses offered 
imply certain domains contribute total hosts network simply free riders distributed equally 
additionally domains function proxy bandwidth example aol com hosts tend operate modems rr com cable modem connections

discussion studies social dilemmas gl hu hu shown hard generate spontaneous cooperation large anonymous groups 
shown gnutella exception finding experimental study user patterns shows free riding norm exception 
distributed systems gnutella rely voluntary cooperation free riding may eventually render useless individuals contribute new high quality 
current debate copyright non issue compared possible collapse systems 
collapse happen factors tragedy digital commons increased system vulnerability discuss 
tragedy digital commons ideal analysis free riding allow calculate contribution provided individuals exchange consumption proportion fixed cost 
ways individuals gnutella contribute 
simply uploading files 
second active participation protocol network providing glue holds network 
may peers network contribute provide downloadable files 
point peers act glue provide diminishing returns system leading ways quality service degrades 
peers provide files set handle limited number connections file download 
limit essentially considered bandwidth limitation hosts 
imagine hosts provide responses file requests illustrated results section 
connections peers limited rapidly saturated remain preventing bulk population retrieving content 
second way quality service degrades impact additional hosts search horizon 
search horizon farthest set hosts reachable search request 
example time live search messages reach peers hops away 
host hops away unreachable outside horizon 
number peers gnutella increases hosts pushed outside search horizon files held hosts reach 
vulnerability argument appeared popular press regarding systems gnutella diminished risk system shut lawsuit attack 
impossible users argue recording industry association america sue 
belief spread press allowed users believe safe 
unfortunately light evidence provided gnutella provides false sense security 
seen experiments small collection peers provide bulk shared files answered queries 
providers act centralized server consisting peers need sue users bulk users 
simply need target top serving peers serve 
overcoming free riding ways patching gnutella accommodate privacy rules scale effectively interesting establish different file sharing applications rely technological features induce users share 
freenet example forces caching downloaded files various hosts 
allows replication data network forcing network provide shared files 
unfortunately system prone replication bad illegal data tainting hosts second cost automatic replication implemented freenet unique identifiers files forces users know exactly looking 
napster default downloads files shared upload directory 
way user downloads file automatically shared 
ways feature addresses freenet problem users keep files computers 
users easily circumvent shared upload download directory frequently 
witnessed napster users speed network connections saying modem high speed connection order discourage users connecting 
system provide set solutions free riding cost introducing problems systems 
possible solution problem transformation effectively public private 
accomplished setting market architecture allows peers buy sell computer processing resources spirit spawn created wa 
context stress utility users necessarily monetary 
instance issues prestige status drive participation open source systems linux lo said seti home se obviously owner pc detects intelligent signal outer space constitute great utility 
alternative eliminating free riding reduce cost 
example usenet system allowing degree anonymity provided great advantage individual users messages distributed infrastructure offloaded bandwidth requirements individuals 
cost user initial posting message propagated system 
analyzed user traffic gnutella concluded significant amount free riding system 
specifically nearly gnutella users share files nearly responses returned top sharing hosts 
furthermore free riding distributed evenly domains group contributes significantly peers volunteer share files necessarily desirable ones 
findings serious implications development gnutella variants 
order distributed systems central monitoring succeed large amount voluntary cooperation required requirement hard fulfill systems large user populations remain anonymous 
logic decision cooperate changes interaction ongoing expected utility gains join ones influencing rational individual decision 
particular individual expectations concerning evolution social dilemma play significant role member decisions hu
