overview foraging strategy ants studied mexican tropical forest near border 
colonies ants comprise approximately individuals time small percentage hunting 
global strategy prey searching characterized follows 
ants create hunting sites distributed relatively uniformly nest distance approximately 
hunting sites radius approximately way mosaic small areas ants cover large surface nest 
periodically nest location changes

nest move quite complex process relying ants specialized search new site recruitment mechanism called tandem running ant leads 
local strategy foraging ant follows 
initially ant randomly chooses hunting site nest 
success prey capture memorizes site 
ant tendency go back successful hunting site path 
follow path uses visual landmarks 
prey captured hunting site exploration performed ant starts hunting site 
hunting site ant longer receives reinforcement represented capture prey tendency explore hunting sites 
specifically move previously explored hunting site highlights ability memorize sites 
prey captured ant goes straight back nest
