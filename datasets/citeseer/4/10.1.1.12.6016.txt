ontologies shown right answer knowledge structuring modelling providing formal conceptualization particular domain shared group people organization ol 
centralized ontologies need long development phase difficult maintain 
suggest distributed approach knowledge management better fits true situation organizations processes people 
technological point view peer peer solutions particularly suited possible different participants organizations individuals departments maintain knowledge structure exchanging information 
today solutions extremely limited rely keyword search appropriate high requirements
