alternate approach allows user browse subject hierarchy 
subject hierarchies typically created humans coverage larger general purpose search engine 
search engine northern light approach called custom folders organizes search results categories 
results may organized clusters desired category fixed choices user manually filter results 
northern light currently allows users specify different categories prior searching

query modification query modification new concept 
years process called query reformulation relevance feedback enhance precision search systems 
query modification internally query different submitted user 
modifications include changing terms making phrases removing terms adding extra terms 
goal internal query representative user intent knowledge contents database 
simple example user typing jordan 
user looking sports related results better query michael jordan basketball helping reduce chance document returned country jordan different michael jordan 
mitra describe automatic approach discover extra query terms improve search precision 
basic algorithm relevance feedback algorithms retrieves initial set possibly relevant documents discovers correlated features expand query 
algorithms attempt focus relevant results opposed entire set 
considering results consistent user original query effective query modification generated
