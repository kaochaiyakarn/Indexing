vast amount information available casual user today mainly due proliferation world wide web www 
difficult find information appropriate query 
users usually find relevant information increasingly difficult isolate information suitable terms style finn nick ucd genre 
current search services take size fits approach little account individual users needs preferences 
techniques succeed identifying relevant documents large number documents relevant query difficult isolate documents relevant query 
easy achieve high recall high precision addition high recall challenging 
huge volume information available means new techniques needed filter relevant documents identify information best satisfies users information need 
identified automatic genre analysis additional tool complement existing techniques improve results returned user
