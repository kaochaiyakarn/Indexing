decode proposal health database executive summary ross anderson october invited medical association evaluate privacy aspects decode proposal central database medical records genealogy genetic data 
primary proposed database research hereditary diseases behalf drug companies secondary uses include providing management information health service supporting research 
components database essentially public domain genetic data gathered patients consent research 
medical records collected hospitals health centres de identified extent obvious identifiers names social security numbers replaced single pseudonym 
patients right opt database asked give explicit consent 
creates serious conflict medical ethics data protection principles demand exceptions patients consent sought personal health information 
countries permit data anonymous certain circumstances consent 
example health service managers routinely gather statistics numbers operations consumption drugs 
statistics typically compiled current records give snapshot healthcare activity certain time short period de identifying records relatively easy 
countries maintain databases de identified medical records link health care encounters patient life 
records practice impossible de identify completely combination data frequently identify patient 
meet usual test requiring unreasonable effort attacker wishes identify patient 
necessary quite extensive controls prevent abuse 
example new zealand maintains database called national medical data set contains citizens health records identified encrypted social security number 
addition system limits access small group health service statisticians limits type enquiry rejects enquiry answered records patients 
presence controls special administrative measures thought necessary national databases am aware operated government agencies cases special legislation data protection regulation thought necessary 
number reasons database proposed iceland lies limits established precedent firstly proposed system intrinsically difficult protect existing health databases contains information genealogy health proposed allow access large transient population commercial subscribers carefully statisticians secondly proposed database available ministry health tasks cost control 
time medical records available centrally government kept locally health centres clinics 
raises number ethical issues appear escaped debate despite environment greatly increased privacy risk compared existing systems measures proposed limit scope users enquiries provide technical protection ways credible 
information proposed database determine effective protection measures feasible 
proposed database falls outside boundaries acceptable europe 
established proposed cause serious conflict ethical principle identifiable health information available consent patient 
recommend medical association oppose current bill 
need rule possibility supporting amended proposal uses database clarified appropriate security measures included 
wish point proposed database conflict established data protection principles 
data protection authorities overseas acquire view iceland country normal data protection controls bypassed easily powerful vested interests extremely grave consequences trade development 
caution considering matter simple choice national development medical privacy 
decode genetics sponsored legislation currently parliament enable construct database medical records genealogy genetic data 
stated objective facilitate research hereditary diseases enable decode clients mainly drug companies develop test new products 
number secondary uses envisaged providing management information health service supporting research 
components database essentially public domain genealogical database developed decode may complete online sources currently available 
component database appears privacy implications underlying records publicly available 
genetic data gathered patients consent research implication historical data pathology samples post appears dropped 
privacy protection requirement data order prevent applications patients 
medical records proposed collected hospitals health centres de identified extent obvious identifiers names social security numbers replaced single pseudonym encrypted social security number provided database 
patients right opt database asked give explicit consent 
non consensual secondary uses medical records raise sharp ethical concerns dealt de identifying records 
usual test technology take unreasonable amount time effort identify patient information subsequently available 
de identification panacea important understand limits 
de identified data anonymous 
firstly difficult de identify data provide time limited snapshot population health data health services compile monthly management statistics numbers operations consumption drugs effectively impossible de identify records records link health care encounters patient life 
wishing abuse database investigate business political rival example know facts target investigation broke ankle playing football th october absent iceland doing postgraduate wish know facts treated psychiatric disorders 
cases known facts enable target patient identified despite pseudonym database 
reason database medical records considered personal health information patients may protected pseudonyms 
database contains individuals easy identify search people great great data generations available groups siblings identified 
point database contains identifiable medical information readily conceded decode management th october briefing medical association subsequent press release claimed concession 
countries health services maintain central databases medical records new zealand consider pseudonyms protection 
stringent controls 
new zealand system noted limits access small group health service statisticians limits type enquiry rejects enquiry answered records patients 
large literature mechanisms inference security subject called 
basic ideas initially developed world census prevent statistical enquiries census databases abused ways leak information identifiable individuals 
critical growing interest medical research organisations actively promoted data protection authorities europe 
standard introductory textbook 
sufficient merely require enquiries minimum size query set ensure combinations queries identify individuals 
example possible enquiry target plus individuals second see complex examples powerful attack techniques 
common protection mechanisms include logging analysing queries adding noise underlying data making query depend selected fixed size subset data suppressing records particular data values census records indicating high incomes medical context subscriptions 
techniques prevent possible inference attacks system provides adequate level protection depends closely nature application 
systems de identified data fall broad categories 
data processed remove identifiers released arbitrary processing untrusted programs 
example census past distributed tape containing record household names exact geographical locations removed 
second data held trusted system restricted set enquiries permitted example new zealand medical records system mentioned 
kinds system effective de identification depends detailed knowledge application 
example evaluated behalf bma proposed system collecting de identified data resale drug companies 
case required protect privacy doctors patients 
original design proposed grouping doctors cells doctors known doctor doctor 
system provide total prescriptions drug week 
possible experienced drug salesman look figures say example doctor susan smith went skiing second week february look drop prescriptions system redesigned show percentage market share absolute volumes controls 
prescription system kind pre process release 
decode proposal second kind data held database cases identifiable privacy depends mechanisms restrict queries 
necessary control kind programs run database 
example system merely compelled enquiry programs read records attacker wished find target patient write program read target patient record selected random returned value target alcoholic received psychiatric treatment 
reason arbitrary enquiries permitted database user access query language turing powerful known concept computer science describing language powerful general computer sense may write arbitrary programs 
leads reasons consider security proposals de code unsatisfactory level technical expertise shown far inadequate 
point users access turing powerful query language point decode failed understand th october briefing emerged technical expert understand phrase turing powerful 
am convinced simply linguistic misunderstanding explained requirement user queries strictly limited difficulty doing morning th october decode continued maintain meeting afternoon writing filter police user queries simple 
security expert aware case 
example expenditure banking computer security relates extensive quality control procedures programs examined tested multiple independent people reduce risk programmer credit large sum money account 
example comes military computer security systems prevent information flows higher security level lower independently application programs order prevent application programmer writing code leak information 
example popular java programming language designed order users download programs internet run web browsers relatively little risk programs steal personal information destroy data misbehave 
short problem software trust extent central issue computer security 
security proposals decode particular claims encryption indicate lack expertise claimed way functions process social security numbers turn pseudonyms 
file iceland social security numbers publicly available attacker simply pass way function build look table link numbers pseudonyms 
pointed decode claimed way function involve different key hospital health centre trusted party data protection commission translate institution specific pseudonyms uniform pseudonyms database 
case appropriate mechanism way function block cipher way function compel trusted party key build look table decryption described claimed disease codes encrypted public key coded database 
public key encrypt known icd disease codes giving lookup table decrypt database 
pointed decode claimed public key encryption include random number prevent 
codes database accessed authorised users 
told trusted party private key decrypt 
case appropriate mechanism public key encryption function symmetric block cipher healthcare providers iceland public key mechanisms hard justify decode presentation slides cryptography shown th october briefing grounds know stuff anyway 
exception slide proposed guard risk breakthrough cryptanalysis block ciphers des idea rc 
idea suggested outsiders time time appealed professional years ciphers commute prove composition weaker components block ciphers commute claimed separation duty policy enforced database order prevent system administrators having access full patient records encrypting different families disease codes different symmetric keys encrypting genotypic databases different keys 
am sceptical claim having experience designing databases encryption copy protection am aware difficulties need overcome decode appear unaware 
case principal issue database encryption controls programs run people access program output 
example accept claim encrypting records different keys prevent system administrators having access database 
decryption performed software system administrators access keys performed tamper resistant hardware access plaintext decrypted processing performed computer system administration computer issue 
automating system administration solution eventually long way practice 
reasons accept decode claim adequate expertise computer security claim adequate security plans simply disclosed 
lack competence computer security quite evident proposal 
health database built 
question arises access security expertise problems fixed 
new zealand example shown possible construct operate national healthcare database way satisfies medical privacy interests 
obvious question ask database built deliver adequate value decode customers exercise worthwhile provide adequate privacy protection 
noted order design evaluate de identified health record system necessary detailed understanding data 
significant difficulty finding precisely database 
decode proposals vague different accounts different times different people 
corporate summary claims database marketed principal uses design disease management programs search drug targets genotypic phenotypic correlation 
claims assess interplay genes encoding members pathway identify biological pathways affected particular disease gene product fits provide approaches search drug targets 
envisaged subscribers database decode said briefing th large changing population users able perform silico mapping individual disease genes determine constellations genes influence natural history response treatment complications diseases 
users include pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies insurance firms 
appear require analysts able complex enquiries database need powerful query language 
stark contrast version heard th ethical objections ima 
told database identify possible subjects genetic investigation queries answered records individuals 
asked sort queries restrictions example likelihood diagnosed disease cancer case family develop cancer done simple restricted queries wonders justify investment 
pressed details example disease traced certain marker certain chromosome correlating available health records genotypic data 
genotypic information available patients consent doctor enter decode research programmes enquiries appear require records patients consent proposed legislation required 
remains serious concern decode construct database supported restrictive queries find forced extend functionality originally envisaged 
access ministry health bill provides database available ministry health administrative purposes 
presumably include cost control clinical audit tasks related performance analysis health providers individual health service staff 
may public health missions 
tasks may performed mechanism new zealand lines appears public discussion issues sort institutional arrangements necessary prevent function creep 
understand time medical records available centrally administrators kept locally health centres clinics 
prudent see open informed public debate issues simply wake morning realise ministry health copy medical record believed kept safely local health centre reaction disruptive harmful 
uk health information systems developed consultation apparently adapted ends 
example bma concerned police access prescription records granted order trace doctors nurses stealing search illegal 
problem systems 
resulting public row led establishment commission look secondary uses health records development health networking held year commission 
assure parties iceland experience avoided possible 
order maintain trust doctors patients administrators public health professionals politicians healthcare sector generally better necessary debate systems built 
recommendations medical association initial opinion gave medical association meetings th october interviews gave media went way give decode benefit doubt 
simply proposals unacceptable current form considered better give decode opportunity step back consider produce system respect ethical constraints viable business asset 
despite abusive tone press release feel appropriate response 
understand decode decided delay detailed design database bill passed 
view unacceptable 
unclear database built simultaneously ethical useful purposes decode claim mind 
bill passed turns ethical useful database impossible outcome useful database 
ethical useful database possible parliamentary endorsement decode current plans management cut corners order save money 
recommend medical association insist decode produce functional specification database security specification sufficiently detailed independent evaluation carried 
mean specifying data items stored restrictions processing enforced 
recommend medical association insist health data body consider trustworthy 
mean control chief medical officer data protection commissioner mean keeping health records distributed health centres hospitals having mechanism allowing queries sent 
kind system uk helpful maintaining medical confidence doctors observe sort queries modem believe system abused 
absence functional specification security specification trustworthy recommendation medical association oppose current bill passed advise members cooperate resulting data collection exercise 
need rule possibility supporting amended proposal satisfies independent evaluation 
international economic issues economic point people iceland ought consider 
iceland country tied extent information economy 
reason prudent seen grave breach letter spirit european data protection law 
governments theory law grounds national interest designed police national intelligence purposes 
transferring medical records non patients private sell access clients outside european union seen 
quote statement decode proposals data protection eu ees countries santiago de september th international conference data protection stress importance elements principle free informed consent person concerned storage processing data fully respected 
data subject right withdraw base data entered 
principles acceptable exceptional reasons adequate safeguards correct data 
definition personal data explicitly clear method securing anonymity effective 
country relatively small population information genetics indicate biological lineage reveal identities persons concerned 
code replace identifiers case sufficient secure anonymity 
commercial interests user lead expansion original purpose register 
express serious concern matter recommend authorities reconsider project light fundamental principles laid european convention human rights council europe convention data protection recommendation medical data ec directive protection personal data opinion privacy protection decode database appears provide falls short minimum standards demanded developed world supplying information raise severe ethical problems 
medical association oppose 
grave risk bill enacted undermine confidence iceland ability trusted processing personal information countries
