sentence position prepared functions sentence position 
function returns position sentence threshold returns 
score pst threshold decided number words summary 
scoring function selected training stage 
second function reciprocal function position sentence sentence receives highest score gradually decrease go minimum final sentence 

score pst third function maximum reciprocal position document

sentence length second scoring function uses sentence length set significance sentences 
length means number words sentence 
method returns length sentence 
score len second method sets score negative value penalty sentence shorter certain length
