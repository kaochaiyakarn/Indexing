scenario example knowledge representation provide consider scenario amy walks office notices received email update 
reading mail discovers synopsis meeting took place earlier day 
normally attends meeting doctor appointment 
meeting management software able recognize normally regular attendee generated synopsis meeting discussions sent 
synopsis highlights major discussions goes depth status reports staff 
synopsis flags items interest especially notably action item assigned 
get information particular point synopsis provide clicks link item able browse meeting record depth 
call meeting cued time action item described 
particular item satisfied simply providing numbers latest budget report annotates meeting record necessary information explanatory notes 
measure asks computer fetch group budget report adds link resulting budget document 
information annotations members meeting involved discussion 
addition meeting management software recognize item completed add agenda item review team 
indicates level knowledge users find useful 
having meeting spaces track meeting attendees recognizing assisting people allowing people line recognizing human relationships coworkers supervisors important creating intelligent environments assist 

semantic network description order implement scenario keeping constraints imposes representation require kr easily encapsulate different objects associations implied text including people amy meeting attendees meetings recording documents budget discourse items action item annotations amy provides attendance system recognize amy attend meeting usually ownership action items responsibilities amy responsibility staff list continues 
needed representation store information objects people meetings easily track follow relationships 
representation semantic network roots quillian reasoning computer environments 
represented knowledge concept nodes related directional relationship links representing world directed graph 
exploring framework knowledge system straightforward moving node links discover related information 
example finding amy workers simple starting node representing amy moving charge group link find organization runs member links group individual workers 
structure easy intelligent system uncover information particular topic discover relationships different objects 
semantic network satisfies conditions imposed 
easy encapsulate human readable form graph networks simple text representations simple add new information localized fashion making inferences merely collecting links 
semantic networks continued scale world wide web consortium part semantic web project 
project focuses addressing central problem larger semantic networks notably problem unifying large multiple ontologies 
problem multiple ontologies straightforward describe difficult overcome 
easy describe mapping human centric view world people places things set descriptive names mapping bound highly domain 
different people try create mappings mental model mapping created somebody create separate mapping 
semantic web project spawned technologies translating ontology people choose ontology roll see fit

software agents written intelligent room metaglue language able create query update semantic network information user requires 
developing system identified areas semantic network representation appropriate valuable piece infrastructure intelligent environments notably areas user information meeting management location infrastructure 

user knowledge key pieces knowledge intelligent space users individual spaces

extended layout adding information interests expertise hierarchies groups know expert writing lisp code know introduce lisp expert system part room security model 
role access controls reasonable model limiting access intelligent room example allowing users ability turn lights voice commands allowing users considered room administrators ability add new devices space 
role access control rbac mechanism semantic network extremely useful representation 
node room administrator created links people groups people node instantiated indicate membership administrator role 
security subsystem follow membership links user find roles access user maintains 
semantic network security models provide interesting situation dependent control isn possible simpler rbac setups 
example users control room devices time may special access set meetings instance allowing current meeting facilitator access room devices presenting information 

meeting management semantic network structures capture meetings occur linking main meeting topics contributors attendees 
typical information gets captured meeting includes agenda topics action items supporting arguments documents presentations web 
people linked meeting attendees document authors issue 
meetings take place instrumented environments linked video audio capture meeting progress 
philosophy meetings primary piece information merely framework examining disseminating information discussion topics meeting management software linked 
possible review proposals travel long term set meetings ask system questions regarding previous meetings discussing current topic 

location management important piece information ies need deal location information 
especially true integrate hand held devices environment 
devices extremely useful tools navigating spaces sharing information require knowledge current location provided local ir camera tracking systems widespread systems radio networks gps 
problem systems coordinate framework describe person location provide resolution coordinates 
addition queries location granularity asking amy probably different answer task deciding device trying address opposed task deciding send email message talk pager 
semantic network assemble location infrastructure intelligent room project 
allow integration translation different coordinate systems allowing users specify location descriptions home 
meeting management application useful examine applications depth get real sense network gets created provide 
reason go detail application utilizes tools semantic network intelligent room 
intelligent room project uses java metaglue agent infrastructure build agents communicate 
agents identified function example agent activates projection screens room called agent 
part agents communicate direct remote method calls broadcasting facilities available 
current version application builds initial oh created application demonstrate intelligent room collaborative meeting context 
application maintained information agenda major issues raised commitments agreed meeting time 
record information link events quicktime recording session 
performed demonstration hampered lack robustness data model inability capture deeper broadest points discussion capacity reviewing augmenting discussion line 
evolution application encompasses agents act concert 
serves merely interface semantic network abstracts network lookup tasks simpler methods 
ability broadcast changes meeting structures agents request 
suspect design feature intelligent room semantic network applications having agent coordinate monitor kr appropriate changes prevents duplication code provides better data abstraction 
agents available provide different interfaces meeting manager data 
gui agent see builds tree structure view meeting information allows easy creation editing topics issues discussion points 
editor serves fairly primary interface meeting recorder takes notes 
currently primary conduit meeting information get semantic network hoping intelligent room add information automatically recognizing meeting attendees knowledge seating arrangements determine raising discussion points provide robust interaction room voice commands create nodes 
viewing editing agents provide different views data web interfaces graph networks specialized meeting views simply agenda items commitments 
updated information gets added semantic network 
meeting attendees decide bring person view meeting state augment add meeting information information meeting recorder able provide

network stores variety node link types meeting including meetings multimedia recordings documents people issues commitments discourse items 
types little information attached semantic network relies links nodes define relationships 
example person act author document attendee meeting facilitator meeting owner considered raiser discourse item discussion points raised supporting argument argument implication preceding discussion discourse items marked agenda nodes organize meeting flow 
endpoints links limited storage nodes links created links 
allows complex interactions data model person augment supporting argument node describing agreement 
ability augment links extensively register link created meeting request information discussion points raised certain time link points meeting video 
discussion points raised meeting networks grow fairly complex seen figures
