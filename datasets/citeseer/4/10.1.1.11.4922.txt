relaxed definition group notion group encompass rich complex reality cooperative 
pointed associates classic study group specific unit cooperation modern industrial plants 
cooperation typically mediated complex machine systems involve direct communication agents 
workers operating rolling mill steel plant example cooperate monitoring adjusting state machine system 
constituted group interact communicating sense symbolic interaction 
likewise various domains instance administrative engineering design scientific research actors cooperate arm length direct communication necessarily knowing knowing shared information space space comprising data personal beliefs shared concepts professional heuristics concepts group group designate specific types cooperative relations characterized shared responsibilities

cooperative comprises indirect direct distributed collective modes interaction 
conducted collectively group merely specific mode cooperative 
cooperative may conducted distributed manner ensemble semi autonomous workers changing behavior circumstances change planning strategies 
furthermore cooperative may conducted indirectly mediated changing state transformation process directly means interpersonal communication

core issues cscw groupware addresses technical problems enhancing humancomputer interface providing multiple user facilities principle application program cscw needs address specific requirements cooperative articulating cooperative sharing information space adapting technology organization vice versa 
opinion meeting requirements constitute core issues cscw field 

supporting articulation cooperative effort involves number secondary tasks mediating controlling association individuals 
tasks allocated different members cooperating ensemble worker 
second assigning task worker worker rendered accountable accomplishing task certain criteria soon level quality terminology suggested strauss cooperative requires articulation numerous tasks clusters tasks segments trajectory tasks need meshed 
likewise efforts individuals ensembles need meshed 
words star articulation consists tasks needed coordinate particular task including scheduling subtasks recovering errors assembling resources environments characterized task uncertainty due unstable contradictory environment task allocation articulation planned advance 
environments task allocation articulation negotiated continuously 
demonstrated convincingly domain office 
commonly accepted view constitutes office relies heavily traditional bureaucratic model people perform number tasks set specified procedures developed management efficient effective means certain ends 
model assumptions rational basis action common goals employees organization 
traditional formal organization chart presumed show actual lines authority correct pattern information flow communication 
despite studies dating far back world war industrial sociologists pointing existence informal networks communication grapevine informal groups affect organizational activity controlling information coordinating output early computer systems developed automate office built designers implicitly assumed traditional office model 
designers automating fiction aptly put 
systems admitted failures lyytinen hirschheim 
researchers practitioners appreciate inherent complexity supposedly routine tasks difficulty capturing tacit knowledge day day informal practices office workers 
studies performed sociologists emphasized rich nature allegedly routine activities office complex pattern decision making negotiation engaged workers relatively low positions organization wynn suchman star 
suchman gives concise account discrepancy office procedures supposedly govern office practical action carried office workers 
notes procedural structure organizational activities product orderly office reflection enduring structure stands office procedures irrelevant just procedures constituted number activities requiring negotiation workers result interpreted performance procedures 
informal interactions take place office serve important psychological functions terms acting human support network people example providing companionship emotional support crucial actual conduct process 
evidence apparent workers rule 
perform exactly specified office procedures 
result usually office halt quickly 
imply design office support systems 
building computer systems seen simply concerned information flow neglecting articulation needed flow possible lead serious problems 
computer support cooperative aim supporting self organization cooperative ensembles opposed disrupting cooperative formal procedures 
vein robinson double level languages states cscw application support interacting levels language 
addition naked functionality cscw application system facilities allow users freely negotiate task allocation articulation 
system provide multiple alternative channels interaction 
example system providing simple effective alternative channel cooperative task articulation robinson cites grove system developed mcc austin texas 
basically grove multi user outline processor allowing multiple users cooperate drafting common text 
addition interactions visible ongoing online textual modifications users talk going means voice link 
terminology suggested robinson voice link provided second level language 
robinson insightful remarks worth quoting said non trivial collective activity requires effective communication allows ambiguity clarity 
ideas ambiguity clarity developed formal cultural aspects language participants projects organizations 
computer support valuable insofar facilitates separation interaction formal cultural 
applications restrictions support level expense tend fail 
formal level essential provides common point participants 
sort external world pointed behavior rule governed predictable 
cultural level different type world 
possible counterfactual significant 
formal level meaningless interpretation cultural level vacuous grounded utilize distinction analyze cscw applications 
take example ordinator mail system developed flores winograd winograd 
analysis system robinson notes reviewers criticized system forces people explicit commitments messages 
comments concur objection making explicit textual dimension communication 
general separations formal cultural levels seen creative desirable 
ordinator falls formalised textual dimension excluded marginalised cultural dimension conversation 
levels interact fruitful operation happen take early cscw project management support tool xcp 
words designers xcp experimental coordinator tool assists organization implementing maintaining procedures 
goal reduce costs communicating coordinating deciding carrying formal plans cooperative activity partnership users 
tracks manages relational complexity captured formal plan human resources available productive tasks 
important effect xcp encourages organization clearly define formal procedural obligations relationships appear xcp assumes people settings follow procedures 
wonder authors note difficulty involved developing debugging formal protocol 
generalization approach wide range office situations unrealistic 
appears exclude cultural dimension task articulation 

sharing information space support shared information space core problems cscw field 
issue predates computer technology fundamental cooperative problems aggravated increased scope intensity cooperative relations facilitated computer systems 
observed cooperative may conducted distributed indirect way computer systems meant support cooperative support retrieval information filed workers unknown context unknown 
addition conducted collectively directly may require interaction people multiple goals different scope nature different heuristics conceptual frameworks gives rise series problems quite apart technical problems concurrency control multi user applications cf greif sarin stefik 
give brief account problems 
people prefer different problem solving strategies heuristics 
accordingly decisions bear stamp strategy applied reaching decision 
result biased reasoning 
cooperative decision making regard norm supposedly routine office people discount biases colleagues 
point brought home march classic study bulk subjects experiments idea estimates communicated individuals taken face value estimates taken really viewed reasonable 
bias bias discount cooperative decision making involves continuous process assessing validity information produced colleagues 
cooperative settings involving discretionary decision making exercise mutual critique decisions arrived colleagues mandatory participants 
order able assess information generated discretionary decision making participant able access identity originator unit information 
shared information space transparent 
problems information ownership responsibility dissemination neglected information systems literature colleagues human scale information systems partly addresses important issue see hellman information framework 
second decisions generated specific conceptual framework answers specific questions 
knowledge perspective applied person reaching decision producing information indispensable colleagues supposed act intelligently information conveyed 
accordingly addition task related information conveyed message speak shared information space provide contextual knowledge conceptual frame originator 
computer system supporting cooperative involving decision making enhance ability cooperating workers interrelate partial domain knowledge facilitate expression communication alternative perspectives problem 
requires representation problem domain representation form mappings perspectives problem domain 
far understanding build properties systems despite converging evidence kinds supports required people 
summarize data bases cooperative decision making transparent terms identity originator information strategies perspectives applied producing information 
third problem albeit public discussion presupposition designers information systems information innocent neutral 
view implied design information system needed consider data flows files existing 
consequently common data base containing relevant data different parts organization providing managers unified data model organization believed attainable 
words hard reality idea utopia 
fact conventional notion organizations monolithic entities quite naive 
organizations perfectly collaborative systems 
perspective organizations views mixture collaboration conflict overt covert appears illuminating greater explanatory potential traditional account 
view organizations coalition individuals motivated individual interests aspirations pursuing individual goals march 
accordingly organizational settings information daily purposes 
information generated processed organizations subject generated gathered communicated context goal interests motives 
hand requirement transparency amplified divergence 
knowledge identity originator situational context motivating production dissemination information required enable user information interpret motives originator 
hand requirement transparency moderated divergence interests motives 
certain degree required discretionary decision making conducted environment charged colliding interests 
transparency bounded 
idea comprehensive fully transparent database realistic 
worker engaged cooperative decision making able control dissemination information pertaining revealed form 
realities organizational life investigated seriously cscw turned fascinating laboratory research activity activity producing useful real world systems 
ignoring diversity goals participants involved differentiation strategies conceptual frames cooperating ensemble proponents prevailing group oriented approach cscw evade problems shared information space 
tend focus technical problems multi user systems viewed ultimately accepting technology oriented approach problem concomitant limitations 

designing socio technical systems issue changes organizational life caused technological developments long history 
changing allocation functions humans implements changes technology induce changes organization 
roberts self acting mule instance performed functions directly controlling spinning operations 
skilled removed cotton manufacturing replaced semi skilled operators 
self acting mule induced transition organization modern factory 
flexibility computer agent organizational change par excellence designing computer systems cooperative settings writing water 
careful analysis design information system may designed match current social structure labor processes 
change technology turn induces change social structure labor processes 
bitter experience plethora office automation projects installations designed match traditional allocation tasks office 
office automation experience unequivocally demonstrated potentials terms productivity flexibility product quality information technology office realized corresponding change allocation tasks staff

designed organization 
researchers designers acknowledge 
instance winograd notes time computer system built introduced setting redesigned consciously unconsciously 
choose impact just chose outside perspective 
conscious choices ones follow consequences anticipate addressing task designing computer systems support cooperative need understand control far better interaction technique organization heretofore case see dker 
old problems fitting technology workplace acute cscw move narrow domains start discuss computer support coordination control large portion everyday workplace activities assumptions situation surface important variables 
adequate understanding really going workplace see sections crucial acceptance systems
