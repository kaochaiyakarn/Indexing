categorization task evaluate generic summaries summaries important original texts 
adhoc retrieval task evaluate user directed sum summaries created user queries 
generic summaries replace original texts speed text categorization user directed summaries integrated information retrieval engine help users quickly judge relevancy retrieved documents
