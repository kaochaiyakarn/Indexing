harabagiu report initial experiments integrate knowledge engineering techniques nlp methods question answering 
additional knowledge allowed answer engine process vast majority open domain questions extending initial cases covered trec questions 
furthermore generating semantic logical forms questions answers enabled justi cation option abductive proofs 
boosting methodology relies new sources pragmatic knowledge

new paragraphs returned evaluated generating second loop represented 
answer extracted logical justi cation correctness provided 
purpose semantic forms questions answers translated logical forms comprising predicates arguments localize dependencies 
logical proof implemented abductive backchaining answer question 
paragraph span syntactic dependencies limited number content words backchaining space quite small 
number coreference relations relevant paragraph generally small null world knowledge encodes semantic relations wordnet semantic net 
abductive lter incurs little additional processing 
answer justi ed related concepts searched wordnet provide semantic alternations guide new paragraph retrievals

immediate advantages processing semantic forms 
semantic forms facilitate detection answer type 
node largest connectivity representation mapped answer hierarchy producing expected answer type 
semantic forms indicate keywords considered furthermore alternations searched 
nouns immediately related concept determined answer type considered retrieval keywords 
addition consider adjectival adverbial adjuncts 

semantic forms enable relations words bag words approaches 
keywords alternations paragraphs containing answers retrieved keywords passed boolean search engine 
reduce number loops illustrated enhance performance falcon allow alternations keywords passes 
alternations classi ed linguistic knowledge 
morphological alternations 
speci city question keyword determined expected answer type enable morphological derivations accessible wordnet 
example case question invented clip

hypernym relations model isa relations model instanceof relations 
distinction presence proper names conceptual synsets subsumed words

speci city measured number nodes connected isa types hypernym relations answer hierarchies 

lexical alternations 
wordnet encodes wealth semantic information easily mined 
types semantic relations span concepts enabling retrieval synonyms semantically related terms 
alternations improves recall answer paragraphs 
example case question killed martin luther king considering synonym killer noun system retrieved paragraphs correct answer 
similarly question far moon adverb far encoded wordnet attribute distance adding noun retrieval keywords correct answer 

semantic alternations 
mining wordnet semantic knowledge localized conceptual synset allows semantic alternations 
example case question leave
