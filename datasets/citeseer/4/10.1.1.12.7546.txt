digital identities profiles relevant enable internet transactions ns citizens service providers enterprises government institutions 
confidential information including personal data financial details business data needs disclosed order enable interactions 
particularly interesting case internet interactions span multiple parties government scenarios due sub contracting outsourcing integration services supplied multiple providers 
case disclosure personal identity profile information enable single sign reduce complexity simplify users experiences 
personal identity profile information precious valuable organisations improve customise services provide statistical strategic marketing information sold third parties 
hand unauthorised information violate users privacy cause encourage spamming 
people perceive address related security privacy issues different ways ranging completely ignoring indiscriminately disclosing personal data concerned prevent internet web applications 
situations commonly occur users bother read long lists terms conditions concerning privacy confidentiality understand time 
users asked web sites authorization electronically manage information order carry transactions 
identity privacy management solutions going play key role protecting identities profiles enforcing management practices helping detect criminal activities support forensic analysis 
solutions need simplify users experience people feel control confidential data data managed accountable way 
people willing involved active protection management digital assets trusted third parties behalf provide people easy tools monitor keep situation control 

addressed problem related address problem providing people control personal information enforce accountable management information 
order describe aspects involved problem refer commerce scenario 
way issues aspects highlight limited sector common financial government enterprise areas 
shows scenario users deal electronic transactions span multiple commerce sites user negotiation privacy policy provision identity profile data multiparty transaction interaction policies data services enterprise identity profile disclosure multiparty transaction services enterprise services enterprise scenario person initially provides digital identity profile information commerce site order access services possibly negotiations privacy policies need applied description negotiation process scope 
user logs interacts services happen doing needs involve web sites organisations 
user conscious happen scenes example due fact commerce site interacts partners suppliers 
commerce site need disclose personal data third parties suppliers information providers government financial institutions order fulfil specific transaction 
involved commerce sites necessarily prior agreements belong web trust 
scenario highlights key issues fulfill users privacy rights users control information 
time users interactions need simple intuitive 
general users little understanding knowledge privacy laws legislation regulate management information implications 
privacy data protection laws regulate area exist hard enforce monitor especially private information spread organisations nations boundaries 
addition complexity arises due fact privacy laws differ quite substantially depending national geographical aspects 
example privacy laws restrict government personal data introduce restrictions trading personally identifiable information private enterprises 
europe eu people consent personally identifiable information commercial purposes default protect information allow indiscriminately marketing purposes 
little done far directly involve users entities acting behalf explicit management enforcement privacy policies especially context multiparty interactions 
users lack control personal information especially initial disclosures 
addition third parties delegates commerce sites enterprises lack control confidential information manage behalf customers particular disclose organisations transactions interactions 
cases matter trust

approach limits scalability flexibility allowed interactions transactions 
seminal fine grained control privacy personal information described 
authors defines privacy control language includes user consent obligations distributed administration 
introduce core elements privacy policies formalisation 
authors describe platform enterprise privacy practices 
introduce sticky policy paradigm mechanisms enterprise privacy enforcement 
particularly interesting concept sticky policy submitting data enterprise user applicable privacy policies selected opt opt choices 
sticky policies strictly associated users data drive access control decisions privacy enforcement 
papers describe strong associations policies confidential data enforced especially enterprise boundaries 
users need trust enterprise disclosing data 
leakage personal confidential information happen despite data protection laws privacy policies lack security involved intermediaries complexity systems 
extend done suggesting mechanisms strongly associate disclosure policies personal data increase accountability involved parties 

proposed model technical solution section introduces high level model related technical solution allows users enforce privacy polices time organisations accountable whilst dealing users data
