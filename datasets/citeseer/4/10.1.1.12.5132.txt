robust photo retrieval world semantics hugo liu henry lieberman mit media laboratory software agents group ames st cambridge ma usa hugo lieber media mit edu photos annotated textual keywords thought resembling documents querying photos keywords akin information retrieval done search engines 
common approach making ir robust involves query expansion thesaurus lexical resource 
chief limitation keyword expansions tend operate word level expanded keywords generally lexically motivated conceptually motivated 
photo domain propose mechanism robust retrieval expanding concepts depicted photos going lexical expansion 
photos depict places situations events everyday life concepts depicted photos place event activity expanded common sense notions concepts relate real world 
example concept surfer common sense knowledge surfers beach provide additional concepts beach waves ocean 
presents mechanism robust photo retrieval expanding annotations world semantic resource 
resource automatically constructed large scale freely available corpus commonsense knowledge 
discuss challenges building semantic resource noisy corpus applying resource appropriately task 

task described robust retrieval annotated photos keyword query 
annotated photos mean photo accompanied metadata photo keywords phrases describing people things places activities depicted photo 
robust retrieval mean photos retrievable just explicit keywords ann ot ation implicit keywords conceptually related event depicted photo 
retrieval sense annotated photos behave similarly documents contain text exploited conventional ir techniques 
fact common query enrichment techniques thesaurus keyword expansion developed document retrieval may applied photo retrieval domain modification 
keyword expansion thesauri limited usefulness keywords expanded synonyms retrieve documents directly related original keyword 
furthermore na synonym expansion may contribute noise query negate little benefit keyword expansion may add query keywords word sense disambiguated synonyms word senses particular word may expansion potential retrieve irrelevant documents 

relevant attempting overcome limited usefulness keyword expansion synonyms various researchers tried slightly sophisticated resources query expansion 
include dictionary resources lexical semantic relations voorhees keyword occurrence statistics peat willet lin resources generated dynamically relevance feedback global document analysis xu croft collaborative concept expansion 
approaches promising share problems na synonym expansion 
dictionary resources wordnet fellbaum occurrence frequencies sophisticated just synonyms operate word level suggest expansions lexically motivated conceptually motivated 
case wordnet lexical items related limited set relations 
relevance feedback somewhat successful dictionary approaches requires additional iterations user action consider fully automated retrieval inappropriate candidate task 

photos vs documents regard ou domain photo retrieval key observation difference photos documents exploit difference photo retrieval robust 
observation photos taken ordinary person structure predictable average document web structure may immediately evident 
contents typical document web page hard predict types genres web pages content predictably follow stereotyped structure 
typical photos photo album predictable structure 
intended subject photos includes people things common social situations 
situations depicted vacations sporting events common human experience high level predictability 
take example picture annotated keyword 
looking photo person may able successfully guess photo situation depicted 
common sense lead person reason usually people may groom father may take place chapel church may wedding cake walking wedding reception 
course common sense predict structure specialty photos artistic highly specialized photos considers photos realm consumer photography 

caveat proceed important point semantic resource attempts encapsulate common knowledge everyday world going somewhat culturally specific
