construction bdi agent plan agent computational entity capable perceiving reacting 
rational agent adds certain level practical reasoning perceptive reactive capabilities 
sort reasoning allows agent select best possible action knowledge goal state environment 
say agent cognitive capability allow behave adequately particular context 
practical reasoning involves fundamental processes decide goals going pursued choose plan achieve 
decision process requires consideration alternative options selection options commitment 
selected options agent intentions actions restrict practical reasoning persist way time 
planning process consists selecting set actions allow satisfy intentions 
agent modify intentions decides able achieve reasons supported selection alternatives longer valid 
agent intentions linked beliefs world surrounds 
belief desire intentions model bdi practical reasoning possesses necessary elements representation mental attitude rational agent acts dynamic environment subject sudden frequent changes 
beliefs agent knowledge environment occupies 
desires intentions refer state wishes achieve represent motivations commitments 
bdi agent elaborates plan considering beliefs world intentions respect desired state abilities transform 
abilities associated actions preconditions consequences 
tell preconditions satisfied 
application action creates consequences may modify set beliefs creating dynamic continuous interaction 
plan sequence actions execution provoke changes knowledge environment 
individual agent plan built considering beliefs intentions abilities 
agent part community ask collaboration beliefs abilities members system participates 
social agent beliefs built perception world surrounds include knowledge knowledge agents group 
cognitive elements shared members system 
individual know elements reason knowing know know shared 
agent knowledge gather beliefs beliefs shared members group 
set beliefs consistent may applicable sets different agent proper beliefs 
agent actions going modify shared beliefs members group agree 
planning argumentation mentioned rational agent certain level practical reasoning 
kind reasoning allows agent select actions interact environment 
argumentation formalism construct plans

agent selects intention andg warranted agent modifies set beliefs way argument defeaters obtained support executed preconditions warranted look sequence actions allow establish 
complete sequence including plan modify set beliefs adding literals allow construction new arguments 
construction plan actions chosen executed allow introduce literals necessary obtain warrants 
warrants obtained support preconditions allow execution actions 
action selection trivial task classic planning problems reflected argumentative schema 
sequence actions may applicable initial state executed 
consequences may modify way preconditions warranted 
execution may add literals allow construction new defeaters preconditions eliminate literals allow construction warrants preconditions 
analysis progression regression planning context formalism 
planning performed collaborative process agent forms part group select action may interfere rest members plans 
behavior collaborative ask permission introduce changes may affect 
explore situations appear 
collaborative agents behavior isolated agent determined individual motivations beliefs world abilities 
characterization insufficient modeling agent interacts social context cooperative attitude 
social agent beliefs built agent perception environment shared cognitive elements members system 
individual know elements reason knowing rest knows know shared 
definition collaborative mas collaborative multi agent system pair set argumentative bdi agents set shared beliefs 
knowledge member system incomplete frequently insufficient deduction specific fact 
fact deduced gathering distributed knowledge group 
group heterogenous members different abilities 
builds plans sets actions 
asks collaboration member group may execute actions satisfy requirement 
reduce cardinality set agents 
simplification allow concentrate essential problems interaction 
clear members group bring new complications subject 
example collaborative agents defined suppose set goals set committed goals 
agent capable constructing warrant beliefs beliefs 
aggregation group beliefs set invalidate advantages working community agents 
model case just agent 
interesting alternative respects paradigm agents interact asking cooperation set beliefs insufficient 
group may heterogenous members group benefit 
collaborative attitude offer beliefs abilities rest group hand request knowledge necessary carry action build warrant 
social contact requires capability resolving conflicts may introduced interaction 
example intention constructing warrant may decide execute andj fact warranted 
side effect change shared beliefs removing decision may conflict plan case agent intention executing build warrant support agents autonomous quality reflected directly modify agents beliefs 
hand members group modify shared beliefs 
agent maintains consistency control consistency agents beliefs shared ones 
social interaction requires agent may affect group beliefs 
negotiating beliefs agent ask collaboration build argument support requires literal agent find warrant belief sets elaborate sequence actions allow build warrant 
asks assistance member group 
agent receives proposal respect literal added set intentions 
example allow illustrate different situations shown different cases produced varying set committed intentions 
example group composed collaborative agents simplest case knows request taken directly adding set committed beliefs notifying 
complex cases introduced 
case shows group conformed agents satisfy proposal executing actions change introduce conflicts literal added exactly required 
group larger conflict may arise beliefs rest members 
case set goals set committed goals 
order build warrant needs request 
literal beliefs response immediate 
beliefs modified accordingly build argument supports counterarguments defeats warranted 
case shows different situation agent may request literal literal part preconditions action agent needs execute 
case set goals set committed goals 
order build warrant needs reasoning indicates execute literal added 
preconditions satisfied 
literal belongs supports possible build warrant precondition proposal requesting literal beliefs response immediate beliefs modified execute generate build argument supports counterarguments defeat warranted 
case requests literal belong soa tries execute action allow add set shared beliefs 
case set beliefs set committed goals 
order build warrant needs reasoning indicates execute added 
notwithstanding preconditions satisfied knowledge allow warrant proposal requiring literal beliefs intention collaborate decides execute modify shared beliefs 
note preconditions literals belong respectively supported 
defeated attacks defeated 
warranted supported argument defeater defeated 
execute generate build argument supports frequently limited finding simple action allows add satisfy proposal agent may need consequences action sequence 
situation shown 
case set goals set shared beliefs 
order build argument defeaters supports needs literal part knowledge asks collaboration 
reasoning leads decision able collaborate executing action elaborate plan action allow add beliefs preconditions second 
decides execute preconditions 
order obtain warrant needs literal beliefs execute modify beliefs obtaining result execute modify shared knowledge 
builds argument defeaters committed goal proposals suppose requests literal satisfy request need literal asking 
capable satisfying request add set shared beliefs 
case notify result interaction see section 
example group conformed collaborative agents defined set goals set committed goals 
reach needs build argument supports reasoning capability leads decide execute action 
order satisfy action preconditions proposal requiring agent add executes order needs agent know isn capable executing action allow reach 
ask collaboration means 
receives request decides execute set shared beliefs communicates signal completion 
receives response executes modifies shared beliefs communicates 
process set shared beliefs 
cases analyzed far negotiation ended successfully 
search process agents able find actions favorable 
evidently possible situation 
negotiation fail reasons 
trying collaborate agents introduce unexpected side effects 
reason knowledge build plan conflict agents beliefs 
sections show examples illustrate cases 
side effects actions executed order change world modify shared beliefs produce unplanned side effects 
example illustrate problem 
example group conformed collaborative agents defined order achieve intention ask collaboration 
reasons decides execute modifies shared beliefs 
agent requested order build warrant needed longer part set shared beliefs 
way conflict may arise appears 
decides execute order build warrant action requires precondition asks collaboration 
capable directly constructing argument supports execute add executing shared beliefs modified added 
note agent requested intention executing precondition longer part set shared beliefs 
avoid harming plans actions communicate intention adding removing literal specified proposal 
request tends assure mutual benefit 
receives request analyzes modification proposes provokes conflicts knowledge action intends execute 
case communicates accept reject request 
accepts executes sequence actions allow addition shared knowledge communicates indicate task successful 
failure negotiation simplest case failure produced agent receives proposal satisfy lack knowledge execution appropriate actions 
example group conformed collaborative agents set committed goals agent accept proposal elaborate 
communicates negotiation 
somewhat complicated situation presents agent receives proposal elaborate rejected 
agent proposal referred agent decides execute action allow add shared knowledge needs order 
accept proposal elaborate 
communicates inform failure ends negotiation 
negotiation fail previous examples lack knowledge capacity elaborate successful plan reason failure produced inconsistency proposal respect achieve intention anda knowledge 
plan fails try elaborate new 
plans require may insist proposal forcing revise plans 
order able collaborate agent revise plans trying eliminate source conflict 
achieves accepts offer fails notifies failure 
possible demand 
clear expressive language agent express attitude negotiation 
communication languages success application developed agent model depends considerably agents ability communicate 
sense role communication language acl fundamental allow interact share knowledge 
technically communication takes place messages network uses low level protocol conceptual level agents exchange messages maintain conversations 
acl comprises levels interaction protocol interaction language language representing shared beliefs agent interaction protocol conversation pattern governs interaction agents allows structure communication :10.1.1.15.9293
interaction language medium agents communicate attitudes exchange knowledge 
interaction language allow agents assist agents demand services relay tasks control execution commit reject execution tasks report evolution final success failure 
language representation shared knowledge guarantee preservation semantics 
say concept object entity uniform meaning different applications referenced different names 
alternative maintaining body shared knowledge domain ontology 
proposal interaction protocol considers participants interaction exchange proposals trying reach general agreement 
interaction protocol negotiation thought distributed search process space consisting potential agreements 
majority cases portion search space satisfy particular agent desires 
agent proposal space acceptable agreements 
member group receives may accept reject 
case agent analyzes may accept reject 
acceptance indicates point shared agreement reached 
rejection implies negotiation ended success 
process possible participants yield compromise state acceptance reached agreement favorable 
metaphor negotiation requires agents certain minimal capabilities 
able proposal space acceptable situations accept reject proposal elaborate words may influence effectiveness message 
expressions insist demand imply greater 
notwithstanding acceptance depend words mental attitude receiver respect request 
dialogue initiated proposal agent requires agent execute plan accept proposal attend requirement adds shared knowledge 
alternatively reject proposal conflict plan achieve tries elaborate plan require achieve insist requirement 
face insistence seeks plan conflict accepts requirement adds shared knowledge 
case rejects proposal 
agent revises intentions decides persist 
agent revises intentions tries abandon reasons trying reach committing new goal elaborate plan conflicts wit interaction language interaction language bdi agents able express mental attitudes beliefs desires intentions 
way essential functions offered interaction language retain aspects allow humans communicate 
philosophers linguists developed formal model human communication known speech act theory 
model served base development languages oriented communication multiagent systems 
interaction languages speech act theory capture essential characteristics human communication transport adequate model development artificial agents 
idea recognize internal aspects artificial autonomous entity considering particular changes interacts 
essential idea theory communication special class action 
doesn express sentences may true false executes actions requirements suggestions promises speech act minimum unit communication 
expression speech act denotes action time 
interaction language agents theory speech acts comprised set communication primitives 
generally possible define set primitives captures essential aspects communication independent application domain 
semantic description set yields communication model 
selection set primitives related knowledge representation language 
system developed content specification language set interaction language primitives reduced 
hand different languages communication contents set primitives larger 
way interaction language going implementation applications different domains different content specification languages set versatile cover diversity 
negotiation primitives negotiation dialogue established agents exchange messages express proposals counter proposals 
messages actions try modify mental attitude participant dialogue 
say communicative acts express fact communication particular type action 
simplest negotiation primitives requests add agent modify shared knowledge order needs authorization authorize add agent received request needs add shared knowledge find conflict authorizes request 
require agent needs requests addition shared knowledge 
insist agent needs request addition shared knowledge reformulate plans 
demand agent needs request addition shared knowledge modify intentions 
accept agent received requirement shared knowledge capable doing accepts proposal 
reject agent received requirement shared knowledge capable doing rejects proposal 
unable agent received requirement shared knowledge capable doing knowledge 
participants interested reaching agreement ad cooperative attitude 
information faster process negotiation 
part shared knowledge needs part plan reach intention avoiding conflicts 
primitives extended include intention agent message require insist demand agent partial knowledge world partial knowledge mental state rest agents 
agent includes argument proposal way showing part mental state 
proposed negotiation protocol bdi agents participants maintain conversation trying initially divergent interests converge 
process successful communication ends shared agreement reached 
initially agent request asking agent knowledge order obtain goal 
receiver collaborative attitude tries cooperate 
successful modifies set shared beliefs 
conflict dialogue continues participants shows part mental attitude tries influence agent plans preferences 
communicative acts actions way provoke changes environment state 
negotiation success depends considerably agents ability communicating exchanging knowledge 
sense language role fundamental determines sender capacity specify message emphasis receiver capacity choose course action compatible function 
proposes specific negotiation primitives effectiveness communicative acts exchanged dialogue 
mental attitude receiver considered proposal type communicative act request 
interaction agents considerably enhanced context provides norms allow establish general agreements behavior 
norms don force individuals act specific way condition social behavior structure interaction rest agents 
proposed model extended reflect impact norms roles relationships negotiation process
