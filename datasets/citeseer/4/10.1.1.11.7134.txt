reliably producing better representations requires understanding important characteristics representations change different transformations 
transformations applied natural language text take account fact text contains distinct words optimal statistical classification methods ir indexing terms words redundant noisy infrequent 
semantic standpoint words ambiguous identifiers content broader meaning desirable 
term clustering method groups redundant terms grouping reduces noise increases frequency assignment 
fewer clusters original terms dimensionality reduced 
semantic properties suffer ambiguity increased meaning broadened
