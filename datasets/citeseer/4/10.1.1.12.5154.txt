query topic root set log web web base set user set log 
procedure find expert query system proxy logs record user visit information web pages recorded proxy logs indexed text retrieval system okapi 
procedure identifying expert query topic illustrated explained follows query 
firstly query sent text retrieval system okapi top pages form root set 
step get root set containing web pages relevant query visited users 
threshold set control number include reasonable number relevant pages root set 

root set expanded base set including pages point root set pages pointed pages root set 
link structure base set extracted form adjacent matrix determine neighborhood root set algorithm needs follow links point documents 
links easily obtained fetching document 
way obtaining links altavista queries form link returns list documents point url implementation 
doing step fact constructed sub graph web containing relevant pages recorded proxy log order measure importance pages wide scale 

extract user visit information proxy log form visit matrix 
proxy logs extract list users visited root set pages visit relationships users web pages construct visit matrix accordingly 
visit matrix sparse smooth zero entries replacing zero entries small numbers 
example total number zero entries replace entries means probability random visit pages
