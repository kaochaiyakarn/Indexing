re booking airline ticket online say want travel london probably get response airport matches london 
please type new airport name code select airport list london england london england lhr london england lon airports london england stn london oa canada london system browser sending information list possible airports world letter code means airport 
passenger requesting flight london wish travel airports 
ectively letter code possible sense word london interact ectively system know meanings acceptable user

user see options choose appropriate travel needs system information travel needs able correct decision 
word london ambiguous particularly polysemous meaning senses process deciding meaning appropriate known ambiguity resolution disambiguation

research word sense disambiguation wsd natural language processing goes back decades historical survey 
central theme able sense word examining context word written wsd text speech 
initial focussed laboriously building expert classifiers enumerate di erent contexts word appear information sense 
machine readable dictionaries mrd available automatically provide information disambiguation 
early quite representative approach hierarchy concepts say lon hypernym parent node lhr stn 
lesk words definitions mrd clues indicate sense 
example sense word ash defined genus trees olive family leaves thin bark gray webster sentence encounter words tree leaves near word ash evidence sense ash 
problem information provided sparse di erent register words encounters normal text 
example definition major sense ash includes words residue words cigarette dust better contextual clues 
lesk solution mismatch words occurring definition ash words definitions share words ash 
example dust related residue combustion sense ash definitions include word particles 
method relating definitions clearly reflect actual usage sense collocation assumption 
works premise idiomatic phrases seed examples particular senses high reliability 
example yarowsky distinguishes living thing factory sense word plant assuming instance collocation plant life uses plant mean living thing instance manufacturing plant uses plant mean factory 
examples find words indicate sense gradually extend coverage 
method involves labelled instances sense examining surrounding contexts extrapolating achieve similar labelling similar contexts 
get representative sample instances di erent senses initial labelling phase carried cost human annotators

late wsd recognised field natural language processing internally defined standards senseval evaluation contests 
contests provide manually annotated training data held evaluation data compare performance di erent systems

viewing ambiguity problem approach creating lexicons ambiguity guiding principle defining systematically polysemous categories 
possible choice term disambiguation describe process mapping word usages word senses led divisive view word senses healthy

translation important insofar determines correct translation word single word english possible senses translated word french irrespective sense distinction matter determining correct translation 
information retrieval ir hand distinction senses important knowing distinction ect particular document relevant user

entirely unsupervised approach wsd taken schutze finding di erent senses particular words identifying distinct clusters context vectors :10.1.1.14.6026
