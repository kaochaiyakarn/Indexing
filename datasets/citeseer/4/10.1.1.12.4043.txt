original ctl operators expressed atl respectively extremes express abilities particular agents groups agents 
atl extends ctl way atl extends ctl 
dual operator defined usual way meaning avoid 
atel atel adds atl atl respectively operators representing knowledge world incomplete information

computational complexity model checking main virtue atl atel

semantic structures formulae verified important usually 
concurrent game structures model atl defined concurrent game structure natural number defining set players players identified numbers set states system set atomic propositions observables observation function specifying propositions true states 
decisions available player state labeled natural numbers complete tuple decisions state implies deterministic transition transition function 
models atel alternating epistemic transition systems add epistemic accessibility relations expressing agents beliefs definition atel previous version atl actions represented explicitly function absent arbitrary finite non empty set players :10.1.1.25.5461
system transition function meant encode choices available agents state

noted di erent versions atl proposed alur colleagues course years slightly di erent definition semantic structure 
earliest version includes definitions synchronous turn structure asynchronous structure transition owned single agent :10.1.1.25.5461
ers general games structures action labels sophisticated transition function :10.1.1.25.5461
function introduced simplified arbitrary finite set agents replaced set 
may lead confusion 
resulting transition assumed intersection choices agents 
system required deterministic state agents choices

informally speaking exists collective strategy fa satisfied computations fa 
words matter rest agents decides agents way enforcing 
strategy agent function giving choice finite history possible transitions

example considered agents play simple card game deck consisting ace king queen 
assumed beats beats beats card 
trade card remaining deck keep current 
player better card wins game 
turn synchronous game shown environment env dealing cards 
right cards don know hand player rest game players complete information state 
atomic propositions win win enable recognize final winner 
note win definitely false game 
course may happen win doesn power bring winning way recognizing right decision win win win win win win win win win win win win env env env env fig 

epistemic transition system card game 
state players hands described 
thick arrows indicate winning strategy 
late 
ask player know winning strategy doesn help win satisfied win 
calls constraint von neumann morgenstern history previous transitions strategy specify action unfortunately impossible express constraint actions identified outcomes 
note action started di erent states seldom generates result trades ace system moves loses game trades card system moves wins 
discriminate trading ace situations 
relation subjective necessary agents choices tell decisions considered states 
probably easiest way accomplish provide decisions explicit labels way done latest version atl assume choices label represent action agent subjective point view 
kind solution fits tradition game theory 
identifying actions outcomes may things unnecessarily complicated incomplete information 
consider system single binary variable processes controller server enforce variable retains value step client change value 
client request value 
player complete information current state players proceed choices simultaneously don know player decision transition done 
states possible transitions system shown 
propositions available observe value note just atomic propositions equality symbol 
fig 

transitions variable controller client system try look 
controller choice enforce change deterministic outcome 
singleton 
want transition possible 
singleton system proceeds consequence isn singleton 
resulting transition function unfortunately easy show model obviously wrong respect original description system 
doesn necessarily mean problem having added extra states transitions 
transition system 
states reflect value transition force request point atel aimed model checking re going search model formula satisfied 
way round come believe right natural order verify formulae question 
model perfectly natural 
improved definitions get rid problems 
evolution concurrent game structures allowing explicit representation agents actions fact shows design transition system general case identify set pure system states st tuples valuations variables involved processes instance sets possible actions agents act defining subset st act 
trick 
fig 

new controller client simplest solution 
additionally may useful allow symbolic action agent labels natural numbers doesn change computational costs specifying system natural human designers

final remarks atel atel interesting formalisms describe verify properties autonomous processes situations incomplete information 
small changes suggested atel atel models consistent incomplete information assumption 
notion strategy way defined formula describe coalition may happen bring cient enemies enemies know current state collective strategy original idea atl able enforce 
incomplete information constraint strategies proposed far perfect 
agent see history previous states decision point infer current state cases shouldn allowed 
better equivalence relation histories looked 
modified semantics atel proposed important implications 
instance ctl equivalent 
ctl redefined 
vanilla atel weaker property 
explicit representation actions specifying incomplete information strategies constraint easy 
enables express interesting features note equivalent concurrent game structures complete information 
multiagent systems 
instance define monotonic agent player uses new observations narrow beliefs exist monotonic reasoning belief revision
