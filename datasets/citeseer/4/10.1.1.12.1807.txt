run system directly trec documents lack redundancy limit success 
greater number information sources draw easier task answer expressed different manners 
example consider difficulty answer question killed abraham lincoln source contains text john wilkes booth altered history bullet 
forever known man ended abraham lincoln life versus contains transparent answer string john wilkes booth killed abraham lincoln obvious answer strings text redundancy multiple differently phrased answer occurrences improve efficacy qa
