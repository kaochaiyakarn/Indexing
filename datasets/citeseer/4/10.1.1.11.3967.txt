open archives initiative interface metadata exchange harvesting initiatives open archives initiative oai step 
order achieve technical interoperability distributed archives oai created protocol open archives initiative protocol metadata harvesting oai pmh standard technologies xml dublin core metadata scheme 
addition bibliographic schemes rfc marc excel describing documents traditional print paradigm oai presently supports multipurpose resource description standard dublin core 
dublin core simple versatile general supply finegrained information 
oai pmh just providing xml wrapper metadata adapted simple complex metadata sets 
main aims oai keep protocol simple easy implement 
positive feedback rapid adoption oai pmh scientific communities information professionals proved concept right number oai enabled repositories increasing incorporating smaller repositories institutions areas science represented earlier attempts 
oai pmh protocol limited incremental metadata transfer providing technical organizational framework environment metadata harvesting 
keep instruction set simple oai pmh calls separation data service providers 
data providers establish oai pmh interface local digital resources service providers arc provide facilities searching multiple archives plus value added features ranking unified access sources 
separation exposes simplicity protocol source strength low barrier adoption weakness oai pmh designed simple possible data providers expense service providers creating maintaining oai pmh service provider requires resources setting data provider 
hand oai pmh offers frontend services data providers offer interface metadata harvesting outsiders immediate advantages query service outside repositories efforts service provider provides interface data 

oai enhanced concepts solutions inside outside oai community promising approaches solve dilemma 
notable kepler project bringing oai data provider functionality publishing individual 
kepler provides oai box tools networking framework scales small repositories single persons small research institutes 
main features java installs client computer handle user data registration central server metadata entry form create oai compliant metadata resource management ldap network environment including automated registration service keeping track connected clients harvesting clients metadata query discovery service oai service arc provides caching offline clients resources provides services general users outside kepler framework 
kepler succeeds bringing services data providers preserving technical simplicity usability relies central service provider 
data providers scaled individual attached single service provider 
apart concept sets oai pmh kepler support community building 
similar concept tailored clear cut audience oai pmh joined digital library jini object information network 

edutella peer peer metadata infrastructure peer peer systems evolved alternative concept digital resource sharing 
contrary traditional client server systems peer topeer network participating peer network node consumer provider data services 
easier participating party provider information 
edutella peer peer infrastructure storing querying exchanging metadata 
built open source project jxta framework provides basic peer peer network features 
edutella connects highly heterogeneous peers heterogeneous uptime performance storage size functionality number users 
achieve desired interoperability crucial adhere standards 
edutella metadata standards defined semanticweb initiative www consortium rdf rdfs

oai extending oai peer topeer concepts essence oai pmh defines client data provider service provider responding client requests 
digital libraries cases act client server time trying obtain outside material inside users offering inside resources outside users 
similar initial situations spawned emergence services napster gnutella offer resource sharing means peer peer structures 
describes organizational technical framework merges oai pmh concept true peer topeer approach oai 
takes oai pmh step extending query services data providers avoiding dependencies centralized systems 

motivation shows typical oai topology 
different data providers harvested different service providers 
queries handled providers service provider layer 
user wants query data providers send query multiple service providers 
results overlap client handle duplicates 
note architecture difficult new data provider get accessible 
long service provider willing harvest metadata user won see 
issue occurs service providers terminated reorganized 
prominent example networked computer science technical library service suffered limited availability best part due funding problems 
case data providers attached service provider may find archive longer harvested lose 
oai topology access repositories accessible discontinued service provider 
infrastructure re established new service provider 
system separation service provider data provider peer maintains separate subsystems data storage query handling 
query routed appropriate peers network administration necessary introduce new peers 
course network benefits additional service providers replicate metadata enhancing reliability performance net 
performance may suffer peer discontinued communication services stay alive single node dies 
community building technical social process 
individual digital libraries may want decide repositories get share data 
oai topology repositories want access 
oai framework choosing scope community service provider may arbitrarily decide data providers include 
approach peers devise community specific access policies peer group concept 
current client server conditions data provider build new service provider scratch targeted community featured existing service providers 
peer peer architecture data providers take advantage existing infrastructure create community specific services introducing new peer group 
oai pmh pull relies service provider perform regular metadata leaving client state possible metadata inconsistency 
oai allows data providing peers push data making sure interested peers receive timely concurrent updates keeping peer group synchronized 
general motivation implementing solution extending oai pmh oai enhance resource sharing described maintaining oai pmh strong points support heterogeneous backend repositories peers decide set organize repository servers 
interoperability oai defines interfaces communication repositories 
adaptability different platforms community specific metadata sets information needs 
low barrier implementation 

query capabilities merging data provider service provider functionality means oai peer peer digital library network address issues outside oai pmh scope 
oai pmh state data providers set source metadata 
small archives file system store xml metadata institutional data providers dedicated relational database oai output created 
hand current oai service providers replicate metadata harvested relational databases provide clients queries 
order give service provider functionality data provider peer peer context repositories able pose process accept advanced queries ability anyway build oai compliant infrastructure place 
providing container metadata oai pmh issue metadata content structure leaving problem service providers address 
means oai implementations support queries extract metadata information 
means searching flat tables containing bibliographic metadata 
metadata bound complex incorporating links additional data terms conditions full text local licensing agreements

design considerations 
system architecture variants enable oai data provider oai peer 
variant wrap provider peer replicates data rdf repository 
small peers documents rdf file suffice repository 
solution appropriate amount data small difficult access data directly 
peer content available data providers similar service provider classical sense oai 
peer type suited integrate arbitrary oai data providers oai 
oai wrapper call data wrapper uses data providing capabilities underlying repository 
wrapper oai data provider implemented configured provide query service specific data providers 
second variant answer queries directly data provider database 
case new peer interface needs transform qel query query understandable underlying data store 
call oai query wrapper wraps underlying repository including query capabilities 
solution doesn need replicate data ensures query response date 
may improve performance 
hand peer developed type data store 

peer accessing data directly 
message format data edutella network transported rdf format need define rdf binding oai 
done dublin core need add oai specific information

extend current edutella peers geared learning material repositories different rdf xml repository query languages rdql telos sql xpath peers mediators provide digital library content 

described introducing peer peer approach oai remedies current deficiencies opens new opportunities open archive collaboration 
effort terms technology larger existing oai pmh lot necessary technology provided existing framework edutella extended oai network easily include existing oai pmh services combined oai pmh oai service providers 
technology barrier oai stays reasonably low 
think giving oai data providers benefits effortless integration new archives peer community enhanced query capabilities easily worth additional overhead
