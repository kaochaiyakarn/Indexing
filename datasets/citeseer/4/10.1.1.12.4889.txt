neurogrid adaptive decentralized search system 
neurogrid nodes support distributed search semantic routing forwarding queries content learning mechanism dynamically adjusts metadata describing contents nodes files contents 
neurogrid open source project prototype software available www neurogrid net neurogrid presents users alternative hierarchical folder file organization process offers alternative approach distributed search 
neurogrid approach decentralized search involving adaptation ongoing network activity successive search changing knowledge network node possesses contents nodes 
neurogrid aims adaptation support fast reliable efficient decentralized search 
neurogrid consists components complement semantic routing technique learning algorithm 
field common multi agent systems require distributed search solutions neurogrid owes origins agent field 
field distributed content systems find approaches conceptually similar neurogrid 
example whois system provides mechanism forwarding queries distributed servers basis content servers 
harvest system provided similar service caching replication content routing approach sheldon included query refinement merging result sets 
fundamentally systems rely honesty person providing descriptive meta data automated parsing server contents underpin validity content descriptions provide 
pilot example kind system routes queries different search engines specialization :10.1.1.38.1850
neurogrid key difference systems user responses search results stored update meta data describing content remote servers 
remote server queried word automobile returns weight loss products reliability server respect query reduced 
system know response inappropriate 
absence positive feedback storing links discovered data explicit negative feedback reduce reliability server respect query 
crucial closing loop allows neurogrid try optimise query results maximize chance receiving positive feedback user 
peer peer systems gnutella freenet points common neurogrid 
freenet forwards queries beliefs contents nodes freenet considers file similarity terms closeness key space generated cryptographic hash 
users know file key order retrieve network 
files inserted particular locations opposed just shared gnutella network combined aggressive caching activity arrangement files ends reflecting key space 
neurogrid move files gradually learns existing location different content 
neurogrid different gnutella avoids broadcast search napster search decentralized 
number systems emerged attempt deal issues distributed file storage 
chord provide distributed hashtable functionality allow locations files determined automatically single :10.1.1.140.3129:10.1.1.105.3673
tapestry pastry variants plaxton mesh prefix suffix address routing hing mechanisms routing distribute files :10.1.1.28.5987
neurogrid approach seen alternative systems track file locations seen discovery layer operates top systems 
terms ensuring file retrieved limited number hops limited amount state stored node follows intuitively chord outperform neurogrid 
point neurogrid intended provide fast lookup basis unique key 
robust distributed hashtable available sense neurogrid provide distributed reputation search mechanism keys stored distributed hashtable 
conceptually separate search process parts

assumption systems chord assumed majority users willing invest time terms ranking quality results best implicit indicators user satisfaction required 
personal experience suggests large red button marked frequently users express give valuable negative feedback 
identified file wish locate 
neurogrid situations don know exactly file want 
neurogrid tries take advantage regularities exist file file pointer collections built users network 
neurogrid neurogrid node maintains knowledge base stores associations keywords neurogrid nodes facilitating search network forwarding queries subset nodes believes may possess matches search query 
neurogrid operates assumption files file pointers referenced number keywords 
knowledge base keyword node associations maintained node represents local belief concerning contents remote nodes 
example node receives incoming search consis ting keywords node consult knowledge base retrieve remote nodes associated keywords 
nodes retrieved knowledge base ranked depending degree match search query matching algorithm way associations get updated time varied

neurogrid knowledge search addition guid tables individual node knowledge bases kbs shown 
note query forwarded possible connections subset possible remote nodes shown gold arrows 
tractability simulations performed far matching procedure possible nodes ranked search terms associated 
example query keywords node associated just keyword receive rank node associated terms receive rank 
top matches selected query forwarded nodes 
queries neurogrid network similar techniques gn prevent loops indefinite propagation time live ttl counters limit range queries globally unique identifiers guids prevent node forwarding query twice 
focus content forwarding mechanism semantic routing 
see node generate subset nodes query terms node generates subset nodes query reaches node match obtained 
possibility node contains matching file contains actual location specified say chord key url decoupling search process actual file retrieval 
note number nodes chosen recommended subset adjustable neurogrid parameter gives equivalent gnutella routing procedure set equal number connections node 
offers interesting possibility allowing node select degree forward messages current activity throttling mechanism node try reduce amount network activity forwarding fewer nodes vice versa 
neurogrid search procedure effective extent nodes possess knowledge bases reflect distribution documents network 
simple way set initially give nodes knowledge contents immediate neighbours 
neurogrid nodes utilize results searches order update knowledge bases add new connections nodes provide results search queries 
best analogy think nodes humans know friends know asked put touch friend may able put touch friend 
just emphasize point adaptive aspect neurogrid comes play search successful querying node updates knowledge base associate remote node supplied matching file file pointer query keywords 
querying node establishes direct link remote node adding system existing connections leading gradual increase connectivity 
important side effect nodes system gradually little smarter developing knowledge bases reflect distribution queries receive time

decentralized bookmark storage system built example application www neurogrid net theory applies files general think neurogrid learning terms user bookmarks 
user initially provides set keyword associations bookmarking url local neurogrid node enters index 
subsequent searches take place neurogrid records time keyword urls came suggested possibilities 
say search rock climbing neurogrid node recommends set urls 
click url recommended directly local neurogrid node update metadata url selected relative terms rock climbing url recommended remote node update metadata url remote neurogrid node selected relative terms rock climbing 
selection weak indicator subsequent activity bookmarking url assume degree implicit remote node able recommendation relating rock climbing judgement 
think neurogrid node storing numbers represent relationship keyword url node 
case urls numbers represent firstly number times keyword queried led recommendation url secondly number times url clicked recommendation 
extend model keep records click throughs case node recommending nodes bookmarking activity user feedback schemes 
instance address transform ratio numbers rank recommendations 
clearly clicked times say recommendations source information popular compare clicked times 
ratios identical 
user searching multiple keywords 
combine ratios fashion justice actual activity produced 
take recommendation frequency selection frequency assuming certain probability item recommended selected assuming fixed unknown ratio thought estimate estimate statistical sense unbiased estimate expected value intuitively larger closer know close hoeffding bound tell fixed error epsilon probability different epsilon pr epsilon notice bound depends number recommendations 
consider different ratios superficially identical get adjustments 
pessimistic estimates confidence 
upshot user searching rock keyword related different urls different recommendation selection ratios rank urls accordingly 
url associated multiple keywords take pessimistic estimates click probability individual keyword combining give rank 
clearly outstanding issues 
click url node necessarily indicator user happy find receive data approach easily extended give estimates bookmarking events subsequent click issue trying take account prior beliefs associations relative frequencies keywords 
bayesian framework suggested underway combine hoeffding bayesian approaches general learning framework take factors account 
neurogrid project current focus trying create interface support kinds learning systems 
appropriately designed interface accurately discern meaning implicit user feedback powerful learning algorithms useless

feedback model applies bookmarks files downloaded network 
user may select url search result short description title

nodes come go rapidly systems 
neurogrid nodes rely degree regularity learn environment little consistency support kind learning framework 
important consider node ability supply content bound just files serve provide pointers frequently connected network 
statistical learning process prefer nodes regularly connected network 
extent disconnected node provides particularly relevant content queried 
clearly nodes limited amount data maintain nodes development statistical framework implemented latest neurogrid system maintains just information extent valid data returned node long ago
