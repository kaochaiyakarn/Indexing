average user gets messages day high volume users easily get messages 
users feel pressured reply quickly mail messages reporting messages received chris schmandt mit media lab ames street cambridge ma media mit edu mia stern ibm research rogers street cambridge ma mia stern ibm com require immediate attention 
goal system improve users interaction mail helping prioritize new unread messages better recall old read messages better precision 
system exploits mail threads commonly features generate usable summary 
mail threads provide valuable context summarizing email messages allow summarization systems exploit structure mail documents 
mail threads groups replies directly indirectly responses initial mail message 
threads useful potential organize groups messages single topic 
ideally mail threads reduce perceived volume mail users enhance awareness contributions topic minimize lost messages clustering related mail 
mail messages especially enterprise tend center people events 
commonly features provide clues user subject matter mail messages 
corporate mail centers collaboration system reports names people companies dates mentioned mail messages 
reporting commonly features intended order approximation general goal reporting important aspects mentioned mail messages 
archival documents mail messages short informal authored 
knowing dealing mail messages manipulating input result usable summary tools originally designed task 
new message belonging thread received system produces summary new message context enclosing thread

re summary mail message generated system 
full thread messages shown figures 
feature extraction details mail messages especially enterprise tend center people events 
summarizers functionality understand mail messages system order approximation extracts names dates names mentioned mail messages 
name extraction system relies existing feature extraction software find names people companies mentioned certain messages 
names shown bottom summary 
message summarized contained features report 
potentially names companies mentioned bottom summary offer clues user original message worth reading 
feature extraction improved training feature extraction software recognize names skipped 
system approach recognizes named entities training feature extraction software seemingly unrelated repositories 
example users pre train feature extraction software aggregating contact data organizer information including mail electronic address books instant messaging buddy lists 
extracting names users electronic repositories contact data synthesized training document train software recognize acquaintances listed user contact lists 
date extraction instances commercially available feature extraction software contain functionality needed identify complex dates documents 
ibm intelligent miner text recognize dates simplistic manner 
hand system applies regular expressions identify complex dates uses identified dates novel ways 
nardi previously investigated problem identifying dates documents ge previously investigated problem identifying dates meeting mail messages 
believe manner identified dates aid summarization novel 
regular expressions implementation simple regular expressions simply match substrings documents 
ideally system surrounding context deduce false matches reality dates 
example regular expressions identify string month march year 
surrounding context dictate string date example contained call regular expressions combine related dates times directly adjacent mail message 
currently system uses false positive regular expressions handle contextual issue 
write regular expressions match cases tagged incorrectly dates phone numbers newspaper url articles filed directory structure date 
system compares potential date matches false positive regular expression 
match system rejects string 
date time identified regular expressions parsed semantically determine meaning 
example email message received december contains phrase monday date extraction system process phrase december pm 
heuristics semantic analysis fill specified information missing am pm previous example 
systems assume current year parsing dates 
mail message received december reads get january software interprets january january 
system interprets date january mail received december 
anticipate uses dates extracted email able search inbox mail mentioning certain date regardless format 
example user search find messages containing december dec tomorrow message sent december 
application add messages mentioning dates automatically appointments calendar software system generated mail summary subject appointment 
subject appointment different subject line message motivating appointment 

user study boguraev neff stein note evaluating summarization results non trivial thing canonical best summary 
section presents results user study sat users system documented experiences system 
suggest partial taxonomy mail tasks summarization systems particularly suited 
lastly describe interesting summarization research general 
performed pilot installation tool sample users mailboxes 
ideal implementation user test generate summaries new mail received 
unfortunately implementation technically feasible 
distributed agent add lotus notes provides summaries agent invoked notes menu 
generate summary user clicks message summarized chooses summarize 
menu item 
participants performed test runs system approximately messages asked open ended questions system 
participants chance system days interviews 
felt important users mail interacting system opposed evaluating inbox pre seeded sample mail messages summaries 
nature mail extremely personal users tend appreciate value system mail content 
choice ensured results dependent sample messages approximated contents users 
typical interview lengths ranged half hour hour 
interview process participants ran system random sampling messages provide examples discussion questions 
impressions participants felt system help prioritize mail messages read feel system obviate need read certain classes mail messages 
remarked summarization system change behavior better helping decide allow new mail interrupt workflow 
decision system helps deal message participants felt system save time especially better integrated mail experience 
tasks asked participants various hypothetical task scenarios commented experience system 
describe cleanup calendaring triage tasks 
cleanup task participants discussed summaries deal mail read 
calendaring task participants commented summaries subjects automatically generated appointments 
triage task participants discussed dealing overwhelming volume unread mail dealing new mail belonging familiar thread 
cleanup participants summaries useful cleaning organizing old mail subjects 
task decide keep delete previously read messages 
commented summaries help doing cleanup don feel reading messages summary tells interested throw message away skimming messages get rid don want read message think reading summary sufficient disagreeing participant intentionally saves email noted result system delete mail 
calendar participants summaries system generated calendar appointments subjects 
subjects find system useful length resulting summaries subjects 
remarked summaries long included short items hover pop windows participants remarked summaries appointment subjects depend quality message subject line 
observation suggests priority appointment descriptions short point multiple appointments shown particular day hour 
summaries currently shown tend short human generated summary paraphrase content mail message 
triage asked participants opinions system hypothetical situations involving mail triage 
triage task describes actions new unread messages 
example actions include prioritizing reading responding deleting filing new messages 
hypothetical situation participant returned vacation find large volume messages waiting inbox 
second hypothetical situation set typical day participant received new message thread familiar 
participants different reactions situations 
situation task triage large volume messages participants thought summaries help subjects 
noted summaries shorter user interface get 
think summaries help choose messages important ones deal participants think summaries help decide messages read mixed reasons 
commented summaries help messages read regardless summary quality example message manager 
added summaries helpful newsletters summaries better document summarization software recognized summary top newsletter message 
remarked triage situation useful feature level summaries 
got mail kind summaries amount text wouldn 
part solution second situation participants active participants thread participants feel system results help decide read new messages thread 
explained context provided summaries unnecessary information 
really sense generate summary pull context know shown user mentioned summaries help message belonged broad thread participants 
case summaries help decide read messages infrequent contributors thread 
summarization software quality participants noted summary quality tends hit said summary newsletter excellent summary 
having read message tells interested messages summaries informative 
result issues user interface allows users skim summaries quickly important 
aspect interest participants thought summaries judged best short long mail messages 
messages middle length spectrum tended largest occurrence mixed results 
typically short messages chosen summarization software reported blank results system uses processed body summary software returns results 
summarization software tends perform better longer messages longer documents tend approximate documents summarization software tuned 
subjects noted interaction system improve document summarization software describe chose certain sentences include summary 
unfortunately document summarization software experimented statistically possibility augmented explain choice sentences 
lastly participants noted summaries useful action oriented items mail message requiring recipient take action useful items appear summary 
feature request interesting highlights area domain independent summarization software may best choice domain specific task 
thread reply structure participants additional background context represented message ancestors useful 
noted context helps dangling anaphora message summary refer content described earlier background thread context 
example summary contained sentence starting pictures background message summary happened elaborate exactly pictures referenced original message 
commented times background context useful particularly displayed somewhat different way 
ui background context takes precedence acknowledging utility including background context participants noted summaries tended run long prohibitively 
cases particularly original message short reading summaries took longer reading message 
noted fact summary ways confusing probably just looking messages preview panes 
entire messages brief feature extraction unfortunately participants feature extraction useful originally hoped 
common complaints don noise participants noted feature extraction software worked perfectly reported entities 
commonly features reinforce knows 
elaborates names list large large list 
noise commonly features decent index 
feature extraction useful stage 
features cleaner cases useful certain types messages questions mentioned 
companies 
names lot stuff got read names appear issues feature extrac tion approximate choosing action oriented items mail messages 
issue feature extraction noisy feature extraction software appears extract substrings names dates companies 
behavior due fact feature extraction heuristics capitalization documents deduce substring name anticipate noise occur feature extraction software improves 
second issue approximation action oriented items commonly features valid approximation 
user interface way system better integrated mail client allow users rest mouse message listing message summary appear tooltip window 
suggestion acknowledges hit nature current mail summaries empowering users decide quickly summaries bad act decision 
summaries potentially save users time 
ensure user wasted large amount time waiting bad summary appear 
participant remarked summaries useful mail client uses particular thumbnail visualization thread user trying find navigate particular message thread information tooltip window 
said task things finding subject line meaningless users changing subject line reply reflect message current subject matter 
tend look subject line especially replies subject lines set 
final impressions concerns quality length improved user interface separated background context users allowed users find position summary sentences original document 
focus user interface visualizing threads mail summaries 
working user interfaces 
realization points interesting suggests summarization researchers served better focusing improving quality user interface improving quality summary 
boguraev goldstein hint discussion user interfaces explicit 
user study focus difference generating summaries document summarization software simply reporting lines email message 
boguraev neff agree simple approaches sentence segment remarkable impact quality resulting summary 

summary length participants pilot user study mentioned prohibitive length summaries 
system effort curb summary length address compression factor issue described goldstein 
aside trying semantic analysis background context summaries idea summarize certain ancestors original message summarizing ancestors 
problem deciding ancestors summarize number ancestors summarize merits research 
root message definitely summarized input message definitely summarized deciding ancestors summarize interesting problem 
user interface user interface summary results focus research 
user study pointed importance user interface displaying summaries 
participants requested improved user interface separated background context users allowed users find position summary sentences original messages 
user testing user studies perform useful depth analysis 
particular comparing system system simply extracted lines mail message yield interesting comparisons 
anticipate users put important content mail message lines message summarization method sufficient 
longer messages suspect summarization software perform better extracting key ideas 
test system performance different summarization software prove interesting 
informal test yielded similar performance software packages formal test find software package performs better extracting items mail messages 

system leverages structure inherent mail messages provide better summary simply running unprocessed message summarization software 
find feature extraction message pre processing best way generating useful summaries far 
system uses existing single document summarization software generate summary discourse activity mail message thread dynamically 
summary augmented reporting names dates companies message 
summarization system hybrid single multi document summarization systems 
addresses concerns put forth proponents multidocument summarization systems anti redundancy methods issue temporal dimension 
system removes redundant information possible reply mail messages material summarized written sender mail message 
research performed exposed interesting 
practical defining set tasks summarization prove useful 
example tasks include prioritization cleanup potentially calendaring triage 
application summarization set tasks vastly improved better user interface 
fact second summarization researchers served better focusing improving quality user interface improving quality summary
