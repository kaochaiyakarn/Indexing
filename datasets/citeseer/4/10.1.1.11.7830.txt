system overview columbia system follows pipeline architecture shown 
preprocessing stage input articles transformed uniform xml representation 
router component system determines type input document set possibilities directs input texts underlying summarizers 
document types processed multigen operates sets articles describing event dems handles het types person centered multi event different feature weights depending input type 
data preprocessing transform incoming data uniform xml format 
data originally different sgml formats publisher wall street journal associated press 
instance format label date dt 
means semantics sgml tags different input formats interpreted world knowledge 
output preprocessing valid xml conforming dtd document type description wrote describe semantics data 
clean text subtitles automatically de marked initial bullet points recognized 
router router program module decides type document set 
training corpus manually derived typology document sets single event documents center single event happening place roughly time involving agents actions 
example single event document set set reporting eruption mount training data 
person centered biography docu ments deal event concerning person include background information person usually form additional events past form follow events initial event 
example training data document set describing alan greenspan career 
time cov ered typically longer single event case 
multi event events occurring different places times usually different reported 
common theme events document set collect fire incidents unrelated cruise ships solar 
time span covered unpredictable longer single event case 
document sets contain loosely related documents set describing research conflicting poli cies concerning covering entire iraq kuwait war 
document set types ob served longest time span cate gory 
sets training corpus single event document sets person centered sets multi event sets sets loosely connected described 
router uses information deciding document set type time span publication dates 
note data preprocessing necessary bring publication date information uniform comparable mat 
proportion articles published day comparison number articles set 
frequency capitalized words order roughly approximate named entities 
frequency pronouns 
time span publication dates days documents published day hypothesize event predominant document set set routed multigen 
experimented longest shortest distance publication dates document set time span day feature robust indicators document set type 
document sets containing biographies capitalized word stood frequent person 
time incorporate named entity component system strategy acceptable compromise 
furthermore number personal pronouns high 
system routes document set dems biography mode frequency pronouns frequency frequent capitalized word 
dems summarizes default mode classifying documents weakly related

multigen summarizes specific type input news articles presenting different descriptions event 
repeated information event indicator importance event summary generation 
approach unique integration machine learning statistical techniques identify similar paragraphs intersection similar phrases paragraphs language generation reformulate wording sum mary 
multigen follows pipeline architecture shown 
analysis component system breaks documents smaller text units computes similarity metric text units regardless source document 
similar paragraphs identified passed generation component identifies selects information reformulated coherent text 
analysis similarity computation component takes input set articles 
breaks article sentence sized units comparison extracts set linguistic posi tional features serve input similarity algorithm 
features include primitive features word stem wordnet overlap composite features aim capture matches syntactic level subject verb verb object relations 
construct vector pair sentences representing matches different features 
log linear regression model convert evidence various features sin gle similarity value 
model trained set pairs paragraphs manually marked similarity 
output model listing real value similarity values sentence pairs 
similarity values fed clustering algorithm partitions text units clusters closely related ones 
clustering performed non hierarchical clustering technique ex change method sp ith producing clusters closely related sentences term themes 
generation component consists ordering component intersection component sentence generator 
goal ordering component order themes coherent text respects chronological order main events 
implement strategy multigen select theme sentence earliest publication day theme time stamp order themes time stamps 
increase coherence output text identify blocks themes talk event apply chronological ordering blocks themes 
themes ordered content planner intersection component identifies phrases sentences theme close phrases theme included summary 
producing predicate argument structure sentence input sentence comparing arguments determine phrases similar 
sentence planner determines phrases combined single complex sentence looking constraints input document common phrases 
constituent structure produced stages mapped generates english sentence theme non empty intersection 
multigen developed prior dug architecture significantly altered competition modification needed order produce summaries different length 
default multigen produces concise summaries related news ar reduced paragraphs describing salient sub events

best summary document sets list enumerating different events 
data encountered duc raises number important issues systems choose topics include short summaries 
summary coherent explaining odd list 
glue holds group documents 
attempting fully address questions designed dems alternative summarizer handle loosely related documents 
time limitations involved lead ing duc evaluation july decision early sentence extraction dems 
dems uses categories features determine sentences extract form summary 
categories relevant specifically biographies relevant determining important differences configurations 
summarization features loosely re lated documents dems uses classes features determining sentences include final summary 
tive features included class measure importance words unit text 
features importance measure derived analysis large corpus news 
lexicon key terms nouns verbs adjectives appear paragraph news article entire article 
tells sentences terms considered important journalists tend include important information lead paragraph 
feature class measure informativeness study verbs done schiffman system 
idea verb associ ated large number subjects express important content 
example verb arrest strongly associated subject police large number nouns 
verb arrest conveys contextual information verb happen 
second class information weight higher sentences contained words related semantic themes covered documents input set 
computing word frequency counted semantic groups entire set summarized 
counted semantic groups member document set order weight higher semantic themes document unique points document 
semantic groups derived wordnet putting synonyms hypernyms hyponyms excluding words senses 
frequency count specific semantic group incremented time encountered word group 
structure articles news main prompted third group features date publication location sentence article 
weighted sentences giving importance sentences occurring near article 
document sets spanned long time cases date allowed guard losing current news 
sentences articles dates weighted heavily 
fourth group features syntax style including presence location pronouns length sentence 
short sentences usually cryptic overly long sentences contained extraneous information 
set length ideal sentence words computed absolute value actual length ideal length negative value 
presence pronouns weighted negatively avoid dangling 
biographies group features targets biographical document sets covered sequence events surrounding individual 
sets stronger focus general sets needed special attention 
clear document sets sentences mentioning subject biography name candidates inclusion summaries 
main feature binary value reflecting target individual sentence related feature individual sentence 
accurate way resolving nominal ignored anaphora 
target name method determining sets biographical relative prominence capitalized word set articles 
example thomas represents capitalized words development set thomas supreme court frequent judge capitalized title 
prominent cap noun refer place organization need method distinguishing persons proper nouns confirming dealing biographical set 
simple solution count personal pronouns refer human 
personal pronoun counts match prominent name biographical sets 
final feature measured prominent occurrence prominent capitalized noun sentence occurred 
es prominence factor relative position capitalized noun sen tence 
additional biographical features sets evaluation run biographical sets development material
