providing users navigation aids best serve needs user models adaptive hypermedia include user navigation patterns 
describes elements needed elements gathered 
navigation strategies hyperspace common problems field hypermedia users tend disoriented lose sense location direction non linear documents 
problem aggravated fact users need maintain track tasks previous actions current context 
additional effort term cognitive overhead 
disorientation cognitive overhead may lead users get lost hyperspace 
despite attempts infer users navigation patterns clear measure 
mainly due fact users exploring document rated disoriented may experiencing disorientation 
users may display various navigation strategies varying goal directed explorative hard tell actions feel lost 
document structure impact user navigation follow non existing links 
example densely linked hyperspaces cross provide freedom exploration hierarchically structured hyperspaces 
navigation support adapted user goals preferences knowledge context seen proper way providing adequate navigation support varying user needs 
equally important selecting right navigation suggestions number suggestions user way 
various types navigation strategies call different types navigation assistance 
user navigation strategy indispensable part user model adaptive hypermedia 
navigation support matches user needs hypermedia links may may embedded content regions 
links text usually associative links semantically related concepts 
links embedded text menus indexes site maps expose document primary structure function contextual navigation aids 
types links adapted user needs 
disabling removing annotating associative links help users find relevant items easily provide context information needed prevent disorientation cognitive overload 
research projects focused adaptive contextual navigation aids 
projects categorized focused user local global spatial context user temporal context 
strategies category include personalizing adding textual graphical views relevant parts document structure 
site maps contextual menus direct guiding recommendations help users decide go 
strategies category concentrate various visualizations previously visited pages 
examples mentioned 
user navigation involves revisits users highly profit reminders 
form navigation support addresses user needs respect ease navigation 
unfortunately provide users contextual information sufficient screen space available users overwhelmed quantity navigation suggestions 
best approach provide users associative spatial temporal navigation aids match navigation strategies address problems experiencing

quantitative measures document structure user navigation paths shown useful purpose 
interesting features document structure include size link density linearity distances clustering 
characteristics user navigation include path length amount backtracking revisitation patterns path linearity

users may display various navigation strategies user navigation model contain various patterns observed different hypermedia structures different user contexts 
hypothesize deviations patterns regarded indicators disorientation 
current order user navigation model useful adaptive hypermedia purposes metrics mentioned need gathered real time
