query expansion grammatically automatically constructed thesaurus 
analyze characteristics types thesaurus propose method utilize thesaurus evidence query expansion 
thesaurus characteristics general purpose thesauri specific offer synonyms words corresponding document collection 
example document related computers word bug meanings quite everyday language 
general purpose thesauri cover words queries nouns proper nouns retrieval indicator 
occurrence thesauri capture domainspecific meanings words constructed document collection 
difficult determine appropriate word window size occurrence 
example window size document word document considered potentially related word matter distance 
smaller windows similar effects seen 
second drawback considered similar physically appear document certain number times 
example consider words astronaut 
words certainly synonym appear document frequency recognized method

head modifier corpus derived thesauri display problems words similar heads modifiers candidates expansion
