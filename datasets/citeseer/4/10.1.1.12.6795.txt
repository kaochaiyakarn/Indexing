bottom model attention provided itti koch niebur shown effective natural rendered scenes 
biologically plausible architecture proposed koch ullman koch attempts mimic low level automatic mechanisms responsible attracting attention salient locations environment closely follows neuronal architecture earliest hierarchical levels visual processing 
attention model processes input image calculating local contrast intensity orientation colour features respectively 
feature types computed centre surround fashion providing biologically plausible system sensitive local spatial contrast amplitude feature 
input image decomposed constituent channels intensity orientation colour 
channel level constructing dyadic image pyramid set images successive image filtered decimated version predecessor 
intensity orientation channels gaussian filter applied 
orientation channel filtered gabor filters angles degrees 
feature maps representing centre surround differences obtained filtered images

memory memory important feature humans agents especially important agents restricted access scene database 
base system memory called stage theory memory 
influential theory memory field cognitive psychology proposes information storage stages sensory memory stss short term memory stm long term memory ltm 
stss short duration memory area information senses converted signals brain understand 
memory fast rate decay items lost enter stage memory 
practice stss stage takes fovea peripheral renderings see section extracts view components 
view component consists unique object group colour extracted rendering screen space bounding box information 
essentially stage identifiers objects groups visible resolved 
stage memory stm 
stm relates thoughts time item enters stm said aware 
contrast stss longer persistency items stm 
implementation objects fovea passed stss stm 
fixation fovea determined attention component means ultimately gets decide objects enter stm see 
note stm stss capable storing objects salient locations explicitly stored 
attention component image memory system object objects occupy salient locations entered stm 
items enter stm resolved observations manner similar 
system observation consists resolved handle object scene database transformation matrix time observation uncertainty level world time observation occurred 
essentially allows agent keep record objects noticed environment saw known

gaze generation gaze generation component brings components order automatically generate gaze animations 
controls mediates components providing high level commands look car 
basic types looking behaviour implemented vary terms duration gaze amount motion generated animation 
types termed glance look stare 
glance animation meant short animations places emphasis motion eyes 
gives effect agent looking corner eye useful salient objects solicit attention 
look animation lasts intermediate amount time equally distributes motion eyes head shoulders 
stare animation lasts longest biases motion head shoulder areas 
motion agent paying close attention environment 
gaze animations important system serve functional purposes aesthetic ones 
agent perception environment updated snapshot manner 
essentially gaze generator requests salient object attention model 
returned gaze generator looks location 
location fixated perceptual snapshot takes place 
perceptual snapshots necessarily entail updates bottom attention model
