description cbml works current cbml elaborates earlier developing xml case representation language :10.1.1.111.2952
objective language provide similar functionality case representation language 
number weaknesses current version overcomes 
allows better complete validation new simple feature types hierarchical case structures feature inheritance 
significant difference syntax language 
cbml version required shoe horn data specific case format easy re transform schema key advantage xml representation 
furthermore version cater flat case structures 
part drawbacks early version cbml due limited scope afforded xml document type declaration dtd part xml document defines structure elements xml document 
early specification dtd concerned primarily structure allow definition data typing form 
major drawback data required type validation structural validation 
overcome defined separate case structure file cbml domain allowed define simple types 
xml community recognised limitations early dtd model developed alternative allows structural type validation 
alternative xml schema specification 
xml schema allows create tighter restrictions 
cbml specification document written xml schema case structure documents follow schema exactly considered valid cbml

cbml document hierarchy 
case structure document parsed memory validated cbml schema

documents needed represent case cbml structure document describes internal format case case document contains content case 
case structure document describes hierarchy cardinality features exist case 
types features simple complex 
simple feature attribute value pair 
complex feature container sub features simple complex 
complex feature type allows create cases structures 
feature definition contains feature name type 
simple features specified certain type numeric symbolic taxonomic

easy read easy translate formats tags contain attributes

generic cbml module developed generic cbml module java possible plug cbr application 
main elements module case structure parser case content parser 
reads structure document creates structure definition memory 
second parser uses structure definition validate load cases case document memory

cbml currently specifies optional tag feature definition allows preferred similarity measure identified 
tag identify java class name similarity measure implement similarity measure interface feature
