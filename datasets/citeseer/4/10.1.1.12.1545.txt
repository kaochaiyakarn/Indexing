stated earlier goal mangrove create semantic web data html web pages 
dealing data raises challenge scalability build scalable system provides efficient access large collection diverse web pages 
principles underlying mangrove authors required duplicate data appears html pages authoring data local incremental distributed people authors motivated structure data en masse experience instant gratification services applications consume structured data immediately produce tangible results 
annotating data mangrove mangrove module enables people mark data current place convenient graphical annotation tool 
tool displays rendered version html document alongside tree view schema page annotated 
users highlight portions html document annotate choosing corresponding tag name schema 
user finished annotating html document uses tool publish content described shortly 
annotations user embedded html files invisible browser 
method ensures backward compatibility existing web pages eliminates inconsistency problems arising having multiple copies data 
annotation language syntactic sugar basic rdf 
reason new language rdf require replicate data html supporting place annotation 
schema mangrove users mangrove required adhere schemas provided mangrove administrator organization 
instance university department provide appropriate domain specific schema users may borrowed adapted schema developed 
section describes tools assist schema creation 
predefined schemas provides simplicity tractability initial development structured data associated applications allowing local variations data expression 
note mangrove users required set standardized tag names allowed nesting structure explain section required adhere integrity constraints viewed part database schema 
users free provide partial redundant conflicting information simplifies process annotating html pages originally designed agreed schema mind 
manual annotation vs automated wrappers important note wrapper technology automatically extracting structured data html adequate mangrove 
wrappers rely existence web pages similar structure case pages differing structures 
similarly information extraction techniques inadequate domain specific heuristics unreliable 
instant gratification applications world rendering new html page browser enables user immediately see fruits labor 
adding links enables immediately participate web data 
mangrove tries replicate conditions editing world data 
instant gratification provided building set applications mangrove immediately show user value structuring data 
example online department schedule created annotations department members add course home pages talk calendars readings group pages applications constructing include departmental database annotation enabled search engine 
user explicitly publishes new data re vere graphical tool applications immediately updated user see changes take immediate effect 
tangible result encourages feedback cycle users expand tweak documents get desired data result just users modify traditional html documents achieve desired visual effects 
feedback cycle changes relied periodic web crawls took effect 
storing annotations creating instant gratification applications raises scale challenge 
system access html content query time impractical 
reason number web pages huge priori way prune access irrelevant documents query time 
contrast data integration systems subsequent commercial incarnations provide html gateways certain data left html form accessed wrapper query time :10.1.1.38.7636
systems assumed contents web pages described system pruned query optimization time 
mangrove annotations web pages stored repository querying access applications 
ease implementation currently store data relational database simple graph representation 
jena rdf querying system order pose rdf style queries 
database typically updated moment user publishes new revised content 
treatment integrity constraints third way mangrove mimics authoring conditions www frees authors considering integrity constraints 
person edits home page add phone number need check phone number appears web number consistent 
mangrove author free publish data regardless published 
database created web pages may dirty data may inconsistent certain attributes may multiple values may wrong data put web page maliciously 
burden cleaning data passed application data observation anyway different applications varying requirements data integrity 
applications clean data may important possibly users tell easily answers receiving correct possibly additional hyperlink 
applications may important data consistent show single phone number may obvious heuristics resolve conflicts 
example application creating phone directory department faculty application instructed extract phone number faculty web space web 
source url data stored database serve important resource cleaning data 
sense url parallels operation web today users examine web content apparent source determine usefulness content 
addition dealing inconsistent data necessary build special applications goal proactively find inconsistencies database notify relevant authors 
note deferring constraint checking application significant departure today practice data management systems 
necessary going allow large scale distributed authoring 
example returning example note data courses typically stored places 
university database contains name instructor hour location course course description 
second comprehensive source data course web page

kind data structured form man grove assists second collection tends structured 
assume tsinghua university desires easier students staff find relevant course information 
tsinghua offers large number courses course existing web page provides descriptive schedule information 
possible administrator annotate web pages course large number courses presents heavy initial maintenance burden 
instructors annotate course web pages aided man grove annotation tool

mangrove chasm mangrove module takes steps crossing structure chasm 
enables users author structured data familiar environment leaving data provides convenient tool annotating pre existing data 
instant gratification applications users incrementally structure data small amounts annotation produce tangible results 
annotations common sophisticated applications arise exploit turn promote creation structured data 
decentralized data sharing previous section described revere facilitates authoring local structured content 
section describes revere supports large scale data sharing structured content multiple disparate communities 
challenges data sharing arise central problem different sources data naturally different schemas structure information 
arise simply content developer different way conceptualizing domain arise different data sources somewhat different domains requirements 
case combining data multiple schemas lies heart sharing structured data 
commonly proposed approach data warehousing data integration create common mediated schema encompasses concepts shared define mappings source schema mediated schema :10.1.1.38.7636
users query individual data sources schemas getting answers local data mediated schema getting answers sources mappings 
approach works practical problems scales poorly reasons 
mediated schema extremely difficult time consuming create slow evolve users system agree data represented consent changes 
schema creation global level simply heavyweight quick data sharing tasks 
second data providers learn new entirely different schema benefit data sharing arrangement 
may consider rewards worth effort 
revere goal provide mediation schemas decentralized incremental bottom fashion require global standardization require users learn new schema 
goal peer data management system pdms component create ad hoc environment participant add new structured data new schemas new mappings schemas 
user system pose query preferred schema 
pdms find data sources related schema transitive closure mappings sources answer query user schema 
approach addresses problems cited brings world capabilities schema berkeley stanford mit oxford roma tsinghua pdms university example 
arrows correspond schema mappings peers 
central mediated schema necessary 
long mapping graph connected peer access data peer schema mapping links 
creation mediation 
support incremental creation new schema concepts new mappings meaning user easily extend system needing global agreement 
allow users continue query existing schemas forcing learn new ones meaning data sharing nearly automatic transparent appropriate mappings established 
natural extensibility pdms best illustrated continuing running example 
section saw individual university web sites annotated semantic information 
example suppose universities world adopted revere content authoring tools annotated web pages 
universities revere query tools support ad hoc queries users developed dynamic web pages university wide seminar calendar views defined structured data 
universities want join network distance education courses 
naturally university different independently evolved schema mark web pages 
reasons cited creating single mediated schema universities infeasible 
furthermore mediated schema hard leverage done university rome schema terms italian maps schema mediated schema uses terms english help university trento 
easier trento provide mapping rome schema leverage previous mapping efforts 
peer data management techniques appropriate task shown 
initially universities define mappings schemas transitively connected 
universities agree join coalition form mappings schema similar theirs trento maps rome transitively connected 
moment peer establishes mappings sources pose queries native schema return answers mapped peers 
result participating university feature full set distance education courses having significant modifications infrastructure possibly extending schema include new concepts language course taught 
student choose courses world interactions done directly local university transparent fashion possible 
example illustrates important characteristic mappings pdms 
advantages data integration systems number semantic mappings need specify linear number data sources 
emphasize pdms need specify mappings pair peers 
peer specifies mapping convenient peer 
number mappings may linear peers forced map single mediated schema 
reason refer system peer data management system focuses ad hoc decentralized logical extensibility participant define schema provide data couple flexible decentralized peer peer system architecture
