context web search steve lawrence nec research institute independence way princeton nj www neci nec com lawrence lawrence research nj nec com web search engines generally treat search requests isolation 
results query identical independent user context user request 
search engines increasing context information explicit implicit context information users implementing additional functionality restricted contexts 
greater context web search may help increase competition diversity web 
web pervasive increasingly represents areas society 
information web authored organized millions different people different backgrounds knowledge expectations 
contrast databases traditional information retrieval systems web far diverse terms content structure 
current web search engines similar operation traditional information retrieval systems create index words documents return ranked list documents response user queries 
web search engines returning long lists relevant documents user queries new methods improving ranking search results 
results returned search engine may valuable user 
documents valuable depends context query example education interests previous experience user information current request 
user looking sells product technical details product 
user looking site previously new sites 
search engines google fast making information easily accessible widely web 
gvu study showed people search engines locate infor mation search engines consistently rank top sites accessed web 
major web search engines significant limitations date index fraction publicly indexable web index documents authentication requirements documents search forms index sites equally 
population goes online tasks performed web need better search services increasingly important 
understanding context search requests web search engines generally treat search requests isolation 
results query identical independent user context user request 
context information may provided user form keywords added query example user looking homepage individual add keywords home homepage query 
providing context form difficult limited 
way add defined context information search request search engine specifically request information 
adding explicit context information inquirus project nec research institute requests context information currently form category information desired :10.1.1.41.3775
addition providing keyword query users choose category personal homepages research papers general introductory information 
inquirus metasearch engine operates layer regular search engines 
inquirus takes query plus context information attempts context information find relevant documents regular web search engines 
context information select search engines send queries modify queries select ordering policy 
example query research papers machine learning send multiple queries search engines 
queries transformed addition keywords improve precision finding research papers 
query identical original query case transformations successful 
inquirus proven highly effective improving precision search results categories 
research related inquirus includes learning methods automatically learn query modifications 
automatically inferring context information inquirus greatly improve search precision requires user explicitly enter context information 
search context automatically inferred 
goal watson project 
watson attempts model context user information needs content documents edited microsoft word viewed internet explorer 
documents users editing browsing analyzed heuristic term weighting algorithm aims identify words indicative content documents 
information font size weight words 
user enters explicit query watson modifies query content documents edited viewed forwards modified query web search engines automatically adding context information web search 
addition allowing explicit queries watson operates background continually looking documents web related documents users editing viewing

personalized search step complete personalization search search engine knows previous requests interests uses information tailor results 
request michael jordan may able rank links professor computer science statistics highly links famous basketball player individual appropriate interests 
personalized search engine server client 
server search engine google keep track user previous queries selected documents information infer user interests 
example user searches computer science related material may homepage computer scientist ranked highly query michael jordan user searched michael jordan 
client personalized search service keep track documents edited viewed user order obtain better model user interests 
services local access large scale index web limits functionality 
example service rank homepage computer scientist highly query michael jordan search service returns page maximum number results client retrieves 
clients may modify queries help retrieve documents related context difficult entire interests user 
watson examples client personalized web search engines 
currently watson extract context information current document user editing viewing 
cost running large scale search engine high server full scale personalization currently expensive major web search engines 
major search engines northern light exception provide alerting service notifies users new pages matching specific queries 
advances computer resources large scale server personalized search feasible time 
internet companies devote substantial amount storage individual users 
example companies www com www com offer mb free disk storage user 
important problem personalized search services users expect consistency receive results queries personalized search engine may return different results query different users user engine learns user 
important issue addressed privacy users want limit storage personal information search engines companies 
guessing user wants increasingly common technique web guessing context user queries 
search engines excite www excite com lycos www lycos com google www google com yahoo www yahoo com provide special functionality certain kinds queries 
example queries excite lycos match name artist produce additional results link directly artist information 
yahoo added similar functionality provides specialized results different types queries 
example stock symbols provide stock quotes links information sports team names link team league information 
examples yahoo include car models musicians major cities diseases drug names signs dog airlines stores tv shows national parks 
google identifies queries look street address provides direct links maps 
similarly google keeps track news articles provides links matching articles effectively guessing user looking news articles 
explicitly requiring user enter context information looking news article want stock quote technique guesses contexts may relevant 
users relatively easily identify contexts interest 
technique limited cases potential contexts identified keyword query 
improved guessing search contexts done personalized search engine 
example query michael jordan return link list prof michael jordan publications scientific database user interested computer science guessing user may looking list publications prof jordan 
clustering search results performed northern light example related 
northern light dynamically clusters search results categories current news machine learning allows user narrow results categories 
restricting context search engines way add context web search restrict context search engine create specialized search engines specific domains 
thou sands specialized search engines exist see www com www com 
services provide similar functionality regular web search engines information publicly indexable web fraction may indexed regular search engines information available regular search engines new york times search engine 
increasing number specialized search engines appearing provide functionality far provided regular web search engines specific domain

specialized search engines information extraction domain specific processing include dead liner parses conference workshop information web newsgroups mailing lists www com parses job information employee sites de hp indexes homepages computer scientists uses information extraction analysis link sources order determine geographical location scope web resources 
northern light provides service called northern light attempts extract addresses web pages incorporate concept geographical scope resource example new york times located new york interest larger geographical area local new york newspaper may interest outside new york 
search engines researchindex automatically extract information web pages 
methods proposed information extraction see example 
identifying communities web domain specific search engines index information publicly indexable web need method locating subset web domain 
flake shown link structure web communities highly related pages efficiently identified purely connectivity 
web community defined collection pages member links direction inside community outside community definition may generalized identify communities various sizes varying levels cohesiveness 
discovery important central authority process governing formation links web 
discovery allows identification communities web independent unbiased specific words 
algorithm efficient identification communities 
methods locating communities related pages web proposed see example 
locating specialized search engines thousands specialized search engines users locate interest 
importantly users go effort locating best specialized search engines queries 
queries best served specialized services sent major web search engines overhead locating specialized engine great 
existence better methods locating specialized search engines help research done area 
methods selecting search engines user queries proposed example gloss maintains word statistics available database order estimate databases useful query 
related research includes 
great benefit major web search engines attempted direct users best specialized search engine appropriate search engines incentives provide service 
example may prefer maximize services provide 
size fit may limit competition typical search engines viewed size fits users receive responses queries 
argued earlier model may optimally serve queries larger implications 
stated benefit web equalizing access information 
appears equal web 
example distribution traffic links sites extremely skewed approximates power law disproportionate share traffic links going small number popular sites 
evidence trend winners take behavior seen market share popular services 
example largest conventional book retailer barnes noble market share largest online book retailer amazon market share 
search engines may contribute statistics 
prior web consumers may located store stores listed phone book 
increasing number consumers locate stores search engines 
imagine web searches keywords result sites ranked highly popularity measures incorporated selection ranking criteria 
small percentage people search engines find stores people may create links web stores enhancing bias locating store 
generally experience locating item web may common experience compared previous means locating items example looking phone book walking neighborhood asking friend 
note different trend may concern trend common experiences watching tv example increasing numbers cable channels increasing web mean fewer people watch programs 
biases access information limited appropriate search service query 
searches stores major web search engines may return biased results users may able find biased listings online yellow pages phone directories 
example searching names presidential candidates february significant differences major web search engines probability official candidate homepages returned page results 
similar searches specialized political search engines may provide biased results 
existence biased services prevent bias information access people major web search engines 
searches directory sites yahoo open directory may biased may significant unequal delays listing sites sites listed directories 
extent effects biases depends people search engines locate items kinds search engines 
new search services incorporate context incorporation context existing search services may increase competition diversity functionality help mitigate negative effects biases access information web 
summary search engines unprecedented amount information quickly easily accessible contribution web society enormous 
size fits model web search may limit diversity competition functionality 
increased context web search may help 
web search important function society need better search services increasingly important
