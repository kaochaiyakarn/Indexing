kind search appears important supported 
proceeds follows 
discuss related observational studies focused people interact information 
describe particulars study performed 
examine local navigation search strategy described discuss implications results personal information management tools 
previous previous observational studies focused users interaction various different subsets personal information email files web 
term corpus refer major subsets treated group user tools 
early studies provided theoretical motivation electronic information management examining ways people organized documents 
noted difficulty people retrieving information corpus arose forced group information categories necessarily relevant retrieval 
malone studied people organized documents 
whittaker investigated personal archives understand value digital documents 
similarly number studies investigated different uses people email mackay whittaker sidner 
researchers addition email communication tool people keep track upcoming appointments lists 
studies email scheduling tools instant messaging explored ideas bellotti smith nardi whittaker 
class studies investigated people organize computer files 
file management systems rely largely content hierarchy studies nardi barreau nardi whittaker users preferred location search storing retrieving information placing currently relevant documents desktop associating location document 
fertig freeman gelernter argued people rely temporal cues locate files

body literature information seeking chi pirolli chen pitkow day jeffries pirolli card discusses people seek information large collections focusing web 
observational studies conducted different corpora 
example jones bruce dumais looked web information stored observing user interaction electronic corpora email files web investigated 
focused specifically people files email support web interactions 
took broader focus aimed uncover people interacted electronic information general 
methods conducted semi structured interviews participants reported information activities twice day course week 
interviewer interrupt participants prompt information activities different corpora 
felt method enable properly understand people interact electronic information participants worked information 
method similar diary studies information seeking studies experimental sampling method palen 
participants consisted graduate students women men computer science 
participants experts computer 
length time participants university varied year 
looking range able observe process developing information organization long standing structure 
computer science graduate students convenient study importantly experienced users complex digital information spaces 
participants discuss issues arise current information organization tools occur despite users considerable experience tools 
general believe participants typical experienced users discuss impact computer science cultures section 
randomly interrupted participant twice day consecutive days 
semi structured interview lasted minutes order unduly interrupt participants 
interviews asked participants describe looked looked corpora studied email files web 
precisely defined looking versus merely looking accessing defined participants considered effort 
allowing participants exert effort find information example bernard able learn types information needs required effort techniques relied cases 
encouraged participants give detail possible 
obtained interviews 
addition conducted longer semi structured interviews hour participant information patterns conducted direct observations 
data analyzed standard qualitative techniques ackerman halverson 
information management section describes participants reported information activities focuses specific types behavior important 
general participants study managed incredibly complex information spaces 
example alex email accounts containing hundreds email messages inbox email directories email account inadvertently interviewed participant times 
participant labeled charts 
names details reported anonymized 
minor changes transcripts readability 
divided approximately email directories containing tens hundreds messages 
web space file system similarly complex 
despite complex information spaces participants largely successful managing finding things 
participants felt fairly control information 
example alex described asked felt control responded interesting question 
think email worst 
people expect reply 
file system pretty organized 
go couple months just kind push things right folders delete old stuff 
web just works usually 
fact find despite people large complex information repositories information activity involved simply accessing information involve user exerting effort find information 
asked information activity instances interviews times corpora participants report looking 
specifically asked participants looked cases initial response reported instances remembered looking corpus prior interview 
expected number activities occurred web 
significant number occurred email files 
subsection discusses prevalent search strategy relies contextual information differs traditional concept keyword search 
order learn explored area search look different information targets people searched 
just keyword search interviews people reported looking things resorting traditional keyword search example illustrates 
jim looking office address professor named monroe interviewer looked web today 
jim look office number harvard professor 
go doing 
went home page math department harvard 
participant goes explain knows specific web page address know page just hoped 
knew small web page saying harvard 
contact information 
went math department 
place find people link page find people went page dropdown list visiting faculty went link looked name 
jim wants office number goes harvard web page navigates information 
search localized situated navigation example call orienteering 
orienteering involves contextual information narrow actual information target series steps 
definition similar day jeffries orienteering imply information current location decide go 
definition participants generally evolving information need 
orienteering extension situated activity reported computer supported cooperative literature suchman ackerman halverson 
participants reported call teleporting 
person try take directly information re looking 
example orienteering jim tried teleport typed monroe office number search engine hoping find directly 
important note bates distinction search strategies search tactics bates 
orienteering teleporting strategies participants search tactic cases achieve strategy 
example participants reported keyword search orienteering illustrated carla look page lost network connection died 
performs keyword search behavior clearly orienteering takes small steps narrow goal 
re search clicked

easy wanted get 
tables conservative measure orienteering classifying instance teleporting involved keyword search stage process 
conservative measure time people looked 
information target people contextual information orienteering information target 
difference information people orienteering information looking fundamental understanding orienteering understand person information target 
people looked information looked qualitatively different things instances 
investigated people information targets labeling participant particular goal seeking activity reported clustering goals general categories 
help interviews asked people tell looking wanted 
identified different goals 
authors independently categorized seeking activity goals 
cases researchers disagreed cases goal determined activity classified unknown 
collapsed goals main categories information needs emerged specific information general information specific documents emails files web pages 
person specific information need looking small fact typified research question answering find time meeting 
user looks general information user interested broader set information determine pair sneakers buy 
case specific document target actual document desired file edit document replaceable information contained 
existence categories revealed unexpected search strategy patterns 
table shows people different search strategies different targets 
large variety search strategy relation information target implies closely related

ll teleport ii total ii table information need search strategy unknowns removed 
surprised find people specific documents 
expected people maintain large amount context documents 
expected find people try go directly keyword search specific information target surprised case 
people looking specific information general information 
finding information source observed people orienteering techniques look documents looking specific information 
behavior implies people maintained large amount contextual information specific piece information looking 
particular part contextual information involved associating piece information source email specific web page containing desired information 
observed documents specific information conflated participants descriptions 
due tendency instances strategies finding specific piece information reflect best way locating source information 
marchionini observed information seeking behavior large information collections hearst suggested behavior holds web 
better understand participants associated information information source consider activity dan searching email dan earlier today doing search message sent guy address 
interviewer needed address remembered sent 

example dan tries find address seeking address directly keyword search inbox web dan associates address email received colleague looks email 
users similar associations corpora 
example participant difficulty finding location city switzerland 
know exactly find information map sites bookmarked 
relying keyword search directly locate city bookmarks access map sites clicked see find map information looking 
associating specific information need source piece contextual information participants maintain information 
addition maintain lot contextual information information source helps orienteering process 
harvard office example section jim knew approximate url page contained office number size containing page additional content appear 
noted contextual information definitive example participant looking find specific piece information email 
example participant memory piece email specific directory email read email bill describing find documentation project 
searched email 
old email 
look 
looked research directory put things sort done research 
anyway research directory 
flip emails 
went tried look email looked familiar correct 
thing go probably bill 
wasn exactly positive 
wasn sure anyway 
took long time find 

orienteering teleporting uniformly corpora 
table shows number searches corpus search strategy 
recall table instance keyword search classified teleporting conservative measure orienteering 
shall see cases instances orienteering 
orienteering teleporting email files web table number times participants search strategy corpus general participants preferred target 
occasionally keyword search help narrow target rarely directly looking 
sections examine behavior corpora 
email email seeking activities involved teleporting participants email programs facilitated supporting keyword search 
participants looked email specific information knew contained particular message 
people went directly correct folder approximately half time inbox contained message 
browse appropriate email date default ordering mail systems sender guide 
example carla looks email find location meeting carla email looked email reading group wanted find meeting 
inbox left inbox 
knew inbox searched knowing emails 
interviewer sort 
sorted date 
date okay didn sort sender 
didn sort sender 
don people inbox 
knew 
knew sort easier just visually sort 
just scroll pages find email 
finding location meeting carla relies large amount contextual information email sent email inbox left emails note contextual information email containing information meeting meeting question 
cases classified teleporting participant searched sender message question browsed returned messages 
participant email client support sorting messages sender participant relied keyword search fulfill role 
files participants orienteering techniques teleporting files 
goal find particular file read edit 
participants look specific information files tended file containing information example looking file 
looking contents particular file 
remembered peri template lines peri 
went look templates 
cases user appear able associate information particular source keyword search teleport information illustrated example needed search emacs source files order find particular line code needed 
went directory recursive grep keyword search tree looking appropriate set characters 
web web participants search techniques varied tended rely teleporting possibly keyword search tools sophisticated web files email larger search space information web continually changes structure 
web participants associate information needs specific information source prefer source possible example jim looking harvard professor office number 
additionally fourth instances listed teleporting table cases orienteering keyword search step example carla keyword search get page quebec continued narrowing target page 
searches classified teleporting consisted searches user navigated neighborhood information target home page orienteering performing keyword search 
email files participants tended teleport associate information need specific source 
case user spent considerable amount time looking tip simply performing various keyword searches words tip percent 
individual tactics strategies people keyword search tactic 
surprisingly individuals tended put effort organization 
groups emerged observations people email 
people reported looking information email information inbox majority time specific folder majority time 
shows percentage time participants reported looked email inbox 
notice difference group searched number instances similar groups 
participants reported finding email 
inbox user percent email targets user inbox 
right hand cluster spoke interacting emails expected find messages implying file messages general 
left hand cluster went directly folders expected find messages implying regularly filed messages 
view left hand group righthand group malone 
filer person organizes information rigid structure piler maintains unstructured information organization 
tended rely different search tactics looking things files web 
figures show number different search tactics participants files web respectively 
top participants graph classified email search patterns 
appears reported having look files information files 
furthermore relied keyword search 
required understand nature association 
appears groups information seeking believe teleport 
associate finer grain contextual information looking take local steps get goal 
confident ability rely contextual information need maintain complicated organizational structures keep track information 
need rely keyword search able take local steps contextual information 
keyword search local navigation participants search tactic files

note appear specific search tools 
reported study people looked electronic information email file system web 
majority times people looked things orienteering strategy advantage large amount contextual information information target 
qualitatively study limitations study 
point existence interesting phenomenon discuss potential associations nuances 
required assess general pervasive orienteering assess casual roots effects 
believe described important search strategy support 
participants members computer science cultures place interest value information handling 
opinion observation population valued orienteering shows orienteering importance dealing large amounts electronic information 
possibilities exist explain findings 
people teleport current search tools find user requests 
problem may alleviated information retrieval 
current tools may allow users take advantage contextual information fully specify information looking 
new tools attempting address adding additional meta data support keyword search tools microsoft xp 
noted observed people contextual information teleport directly information target preferred information 
believe occurs fully specifying information need meta data require considerable cognitive effort 
participants entirely sure contextual information retrieve target aware reminded 
orienteering added benefit helping user specify target allowing backtrack easily 
gives information source may important determining validity information 
possible explanations suggest systems deeply consider orienteering approaches help people contextual data prompting contextual information requiring fully specify information query time 
support contextual information understand exactly information people know information target 
people targets seen cases appeared different contextual information cases seen target previously 
examine nature contextual information case 
people remember appears corpus dependent 
considered looking corpus 
intricacies boundaries search retrieval interesting areas pursue 
amount information interact grows electronic information management increasingly problem deal 
study revealed behavioral patterns examine order build tools interaction manageable
