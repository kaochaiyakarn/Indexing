related substantial investigating issues surrounding word sense disambiguation type query ambiguity arises regularly information retrieval 
type ambiguity resolved implicitly queries long additional words provide sufficient context clear confusion critical problem queries short 
users web search engines generally provide short queries focusing situation study

sanderson lawrie croft working concept hierarchies provide hierarchical map words relationships 
user navigate hierarchy find sense relevant

clustering retrieved document set way deal ambiguity ideally documents covering different senses word placed different clusters

altavista point provided service called live topics showed inter relationships query terms terms corpus 
map derived corpus human corrections provided form hyperindex allow user select words improve query 
system allows user clarify refine query offering formed phrases query appears

indexing retrieval done ciir inquery retrieval system 
system incorporates fast reasonably accurate part speech tagging 
uses brown tag set tags listed 
documents indexed word indexed part speech 
proximity operators allow particular part speech selected word restrictions parts speech occurred nearby 
example boat vbd means word boat immediately followed past participle verb boat 
query boat nn means word boat noun part speech 
combined query boat nn vbz means boat noun followed words third person singular form verb boat sinks boat quickly sinks 
type construction allows build quite complex restrictions query words nearby parts speech 

approach corpus parts speech indexed provides flexible query support outlined attempt query disambiguation follows 
analyze text find patterns parts speech occur frequently near query word map patterns questions reflect patterns questions user options consider re run retrieval disambiguated question searcher selects 
section sketch approach works functional system 
show examples illustrate value approach suggest effective 
section empirically evaluate effectiveness approach reducing ambiguity 
longer term goal implement ideas fully functioning system get user feedback 
finding patterns patterns looking center single query word incorporate small number words side 
example query word boat look pattern adjective followed noun boat trec fbis corpus find adjectives fishing wooden speed 
find sufficient number occurrences pattern regardless different adjectives note jj boat nn interesting pattern jj part speech code adjective nn denotes singular noun 
looking patterns near query word prohibitively expensive carry search time 
reason enhanced inquery indexing stage extract patterns centered non stopwords run time organized keyword 
process slightly expensive random sample corpus 
example shows sample patterns counts appear document subset trec fbis corpus 
observation pattern occurs times corpus interesting ignored pattern occur times particular query word times 
large number patterns making decision way unreasonable ultimately preferable measure mutual information select keep interesting patterns

convert questions disambiguate query 
example patterns corresponding questions query word party jj party nn varieties party np party np names party nn party nn nns things done party vb party nn nn things done party pattern corresponding question index pattern query word keep track number times pattern occurs 
user single word query patterns including query word obtained index list questions constructed 
patterns correspond question collapsed single question 
questions ranked order frequently occurring 
evaluation section suggests questions matches ambiguous original query may preferable rank approximation ambiguity reduction 
partial list patterns corresponding questions 
note language processing useful handle variants queries change varieties mouse varieties mice 
wish clear mapping patterns pattern question noun vb things qq noun vbd things qq noun hv verb things qq vbd nn things happened qq vbn nn things qq vbn noun things qq adv verb ways qq vbg vb things qq noun varieties qq noun ber varieties qq noun ber verb things done qq noun ber noun things qq partial list patterns recognized query clarification index component questions corresponding patterns 
pattern pos means query word occurring part speech

question column qq replaced query word 
questions created hand 
surprisingly small set questions accommodate patterns questions absent 
currently exploring better approaches generating mapping 
clarifying questions may sufficient help user recognize distinction 
help user list sample phrases match corresponding patterns 
example query boat get examples taken corpora interested varieties boats 
boat boat wooden boat boat big boat

sort keyword context list provides information meaning clarification question corpus specific way

running clarification question user selects query questions system transforms appropriate query provides new list matching documents
