introduce evidence trust briefly 
evidence evidence called credential statement certain properties entity called subject issued issuer 
evidence come internal external sources 
evidence information stored local database user name password public key certificate digitally signed document pics rating evidence different forms different issuers trusted differently 
research effort investigates issues associate different trust degrees evidences 
factors affect trust evidence determine trust degree certain evidence 
accommodate different formats evidences framework 
trust trust plays important role user decisions uncertainty incomplete information applications commerce virtual communities 
trust research supported nsf ccr ccr 
subjective degree belief 
aspects forming trust weights aspects different different entities entity different environments 
different observers may different perceptions entity trustworthiness 
trust formed mainly ways get opinions third parties second hand information 
trust transitive opinions third parties directly :10.1.1.23.7883

research efforts undertaken area 
direction trust management :10.1.1.44.6276
trust management system provides language allowing system administrators define authorization policies credentials engine enforce authorization polices 
systems design access control mechanisms advantage existing ones 
direction research divides authorization problem sub problems determine permission set user enforce access control existing mechanisms rbac :10.1.1.23.7883
approaches advantage easy integration existing systems 
research effort direction 
users permission sets determined evidence trust distinguished determine users permission set evidence credential 
furthermore reliability evidence considered system 
trust models researchers proposed algorithms summarize opinions third parties trust opinions 
summarization includes evaluating opinion entity combining opinions different entities :10.1.1.23.7883:10.1.1.102.8227
research efforts done quantify trust direct experience 
personal experience plays important role forming trust opinion real life consider hand information 
rbac rbac emerged promising technology efficiently managing enforcing security large organizations 
role entity semantics regarding authority responsibility 
authorization process divided parts role permission mapping user role mapping 
role permission mapping associates roles permission set 
user role mapping assigns roles users
