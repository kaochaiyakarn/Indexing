multimodal agent interfaces olga conversational agent gestures jonas department speech music hearing royal institute technology stockholm sweden mail speech kth se olga project developed animated agent interface information services 
interface combines graphical interface spoken dialogue animated human character multimodal interaction users 
interaction intelligently managed techniques derived spoken dialogue extended graphical modality 
olga agent innovative combining interactive spoken dialogue system animated character lip synchronized synthetic speech gesturing 
particular attention paid ensuring behaviour agent immediately comprehensible user 
synchronizing speech mouth movements increases intelligibility facial expressions gesturing realize agent internal states focus dialogue 
conventional interfaces direct manipulation user solely responsible monitoring executing tasks 
indirect management interfaces developed allow user delegate tasks interface agent 
tasks established example explicit user instruction implicit techniques learn tasks observation patterns user actions maes 
techniques criticised grounds loss predictability control comprehension user schneiderman 
natural language especially speech offers natural mechanism users explicitly provide agent tasks 
speech interface combined graphical interface provide alternative input output modalities effects concurrent tasking eyes hands busy situations 
speech compensate apparent limitations graphical interface scott mcglashan swedish institute computer science box kista sweden mail scott sics se yielding increased speed interaction higher bandwidth ability describe objects visually 
conversely graphical interface compensate limitations speech making immediately visible effects actions objects indicating objects currently salient system 
speech modality yield increased predictability control agent behaviour sufficient ensure interaction comprehensible user 
difficulties arise interaction extended time different modalities 
cases agent needs take responsibility difficulties may source problems speech recognition language interpretation errors may know task domain user recognize delegated task incomplete impossible 
strategy treat interaction operation agent takes responsibility ensure interaction comprehensible user 
agent attempts recognize understand user input multiple modalities interpret goals interaction produce response modalities appropriate interactional context 
achieve agent needs adaptive dialogue strategies initiative asking questions obtain information provided user necessary complete task strategies detecting repairing problems dialogue 
strategies may avoid problems incrementally confirming information user strategies dealing errors arise asking users spell words 
critical element operative interaction agent report states goals may obvious order behaviour transparent possible 
human face face interaction feedback restricted spoken modality modalities body gestures facial expressions express feedback independently conjunction speech 
representing agent animated character gain access modalities give system apparent personality hopefully making experience human interaction 
essential reasonable match agent capabilities realization human realization users expect human capabilities example speech language understanding 
consequently animated character realized lip synchronized speech gesturing cartoon elicit behaviour appropriate current state interface technology

tri partite model interaction responsible semantic task dialogue interpretation 
semantics component provides context dependent interpretation user input capable handling anaphora ellipsis 
task component embodies navigation strategies efficiently obtain information user necessary successful database access 
dialogue component adopts event driven technique pragmatically interpreting user input producing agent responses 
basis user input events updates interaction model composed agent goals interaction strategies modelled condition action rules see mcglashan detailed description 
goals determine behaviour agent allowing confirmation clarification user input minimize dialogue breakdown requests information maximize dialogue progress 
strategies dynamic behaviour agent varies progress 
order manage multimodal dialogues input output need informationally compatible dialogue management level 
user may provide input buttons interface agent generate spoken response user may refer linguistically object agent realised graphically 
consequently input output represented semantic description language spoken input mcglashan
