open ended interviews open ended interview anthropology psychology avoids problems questionnaire method 
interviewer poses question allows subjects answer wish 
interviewer may probe detail set terms interview 
sounds benign survey interview issues question asked answered answer part normal discourse repertoire speaker remain 
consider questions answered

generalise 
people know things describe 
commonplace ethnography people descriptions weave basket choose chief write program bear complex opaque relation seen things observed 
problem familiar nickname social science say problem philosophers speak tacit knowledge 
moral don ask people describe activities normally describe don believe answers 
consider interview questions people answer useful way ask compares practice consider practice describe discourse practice 
compare discourse produced topic elicited produced related non elicited situation ask interview data wholly different bears partial regular similarity non elicited speech 
approach observe spontaneous speech 
example studying apartment layout descriptions observe occur spontaneous speech closely similar instances gathered interview situation informal checking done actual analysis elicited data suggested structures interest memory linguistic structure natural settings generally sufficiently reliable 
practice observation requires interest adventures friends searching apartments strangers street conversation turns topic 
empirical research 
better compare interview data recorded non elicited data see similar 
example shows elicited narratives differ spontaneously produced narratives fine level detail including historical tense 
difference arises performing narrative addressee visualise event encourages historical 
performed narratives produced speaker addressee share characteristics age occupation ethnicity friends 
characteristics shared participants interview situation tense system slightly different 
similarly form evaluation see section elicited narratives may differ spontaneous narratives spontaneous narratives include negotiations primary speaker interlocutors interviewer may unwilling undertake fear biasing data 
differences matter depends nature investigation determined case 
finely detailed data needed elicited narratives considered identical spontaneous narratives 
detailed higher level structure needed open ended interview data may adequate 
focus application development groups focus group kind group interview widely marketing research pure social science research gives favourable review potential focus groups social science 
technique groups brought discuss topic interest researcher 
market research done stimulus materials films story boards product focus name commonly get opinions representative potential customers new products 
focus groups advantage allowing natural interactions people questionnaire interviews open ended interviews 
groups usually natural communities people eat lunch purchasing agents particular ad hoc collection constituted occasion researcher usually basis demographic considerations 
focus groups may valuable eliciting responses products features trade offs customers understand example willing pay dog food useful eliciting opinions design issues subjects experts respond categories structures provided researcher 
called rad groups popular requirements engineering especially information systems applications claim greatly accelerate development requirements 
method closely related focus groups expected suffer problems 
particular participants certainly unable articulate tacit knowledge 
group facilitators try avoid imposing categories participants guarantee participants fact share categories 
participants may widely different status organisation danger feel free say really think especially unpopular 
difficult non technical participants assess significance technical decisions 
method appears promising believe potential limitations studied empirically 
discussion interview methods fail interviewer respondent share category system 
example clients architects usually unfamiliar conventions architectural drawings easily agree design fails satisfy built 
workplace project case workers wanted space working agreed addition long tabletop

idea find categories members order social world impose analyst order 
example useful approach piece interaction assumption participants doing bad job analyst decides doing 
important determine participants doing 
fundamental idea social world orderly order going creation participants 
analysts don know advance relevant categories come data pre coding scheme 
example consider party people restaurant conference session 
analyst number category systems xerox employees non xerox employees employees large organisations self employed person people just person pregnant blue eyes brown eyes people man women 
course list multiplied indefinitely 
analyst needs know categories relevant relevance mean 
notion members categories implies analyst consider categories members organise interaction categories orient 
situation participants oriented category pregnancy non pregnancy deciding take taxi restaurant 
oriented nature participants employers determining kinds receipts required 
waiter oriented gender developments understanding economic consequences gender placing bill center table facing man party immediate reach 
evidence eye colour organising category activity 
consider means phenomenon organise activity 
analyst state level activity concern 
striking phenomena organise interaction level care 
example video people interacting may clearly reveal particular ways women long hands protect nail polish easily 
evidence participants relate way hands orient organising interaction 
example pass objects differently depending recipient 
analysis way hands may relevant design certain products particularly packaging 
implicit notion members categories organising activity analysts reconstruct intentions mental processes far evident involved activity 
starts writing upper left corner white board say action projects board probably covered 
example body torque posture legs face front head shoulders head shoulders trunk turned sideways 
posture requires considerable muscular tension hold long period 
conversations torque interlocutor partially turned short 
visitor walks office working terminal occupant turns head neck greet visitor leaving hands keyboard visitor project short conversation 
illustrates demonstration intention needed kind analysis 
analysts simply construct subjects mental models intentions 
necessary demonstrate participants doing allows participants infer intentions 
activity analyst postulating intentions different participants proceeds evidence

conversation analysis conversation analysis grew ethnomethodology see section 
attempts describe underlying social organisation conversation orderly intelligible 
conversation prevalent invisible forms social interaction may considered typical people construct world orderly way 
conversation folk term activities members describe sitting chatting just talking technical term conversation analysis conversation interactional system turns preallocated order interaction negotiated real time conversation 
contrast forms interaction debates rituals seminars order events speakers 
example order church service produced participants course enacting spot negotiation shall precede follow collection 
conversation basic system creating social order 
order creates normative form conversation speaker time gaps overlaps 
important note counts gap overlap culturally determined 
example sounds long pause new may barely noticeable new

may select speaker verbally gesture eye gaze participant may self select speaker may gap silence long particular culture noticed 
speaker may continue possible turn gap turn gap 
overlaps speakers speak drops 
important point achieved moment moment interaction participants 
case certain rules define set possible conversations application rules particular situations matter going participants may example negotiate status particular silence 
adjacency pairs important part syntax conversational organisation adjacency pairs partially syntactic partially semantic organisational structure 
adjacency pair pair larger set utterances central characteristic rule current action pair part greeting question requires production reciprocal action second pair part possible opportunity completion 
examples sequences question answer greeting greeting speaker production question greeting projects speaker production answer second greeting 
speaker produced part adjacency pair second pair part noticeably absent 
important distinguish absence noticeable absence 
point conversation range things said infinite pair part projects sets expectation production second pair part notice absence 
fact analysts see speakers orienting absence example say don say hello response absence second greeting 
response speaker shows adjacency pairs merely construct analyst fact categories speakers organise conversations 
discourse units approach linguistics relevant requirements elicitation study discourse unit linguistic unit directly sentence

constructed material artifacts ways people arrangement table room position understood head board writing materials participant uses don glass water participant 
illustrate role interpretation behaviour consider example interruptions overlaps relation gender roles 
successful interruption example violation speaker turn participant begins speak participant begins speak speaking drops 
data interruptions rare conversations 
cross sex conversations successful interruptions involve men interrupting women 
percentages differ slightly depending situation degree acquaintance conversational partners 

west zimmerman suggest interruption conversation partner consequence lesser status way establishing maintaining status differential 
formulation sense necessary understand detail participants interruption negotiate drop 
participants start talking participant begins speak speaking speakers may louder continue increase volume participant speaking softly drops 
appears gender neutral description mechanism 
social meaning increasing volume different men women 
indication kind person case men person stands rights case women aggressive person 
different social meanings behaviour ensure woman drops overlap
