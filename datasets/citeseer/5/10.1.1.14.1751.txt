kappa statistic concerns researchers largely field content analysis see especially krippendorff weber problems currently facing strong arguments kappa coefficient agreement siegel castellan measure reliability 
kappa coefficient measures pairwise agreement set coders making category judgments correcting expected chance agreement proportion times coders agree proportion times expect agree chance calculated lines intuitive argument 
complete instructions calculate see siegel castellan 
agreement expected chance zero 
total agreement

krippendorff discusses constitutes acceptable level agreement giving caveat depends entirely intends coding 
instance claims finding associations variables rely coding schemes impossible says content analysis researchers generally think reliability allowing tentative drawn 
add caveats 
kappa addresses problems struggling field order compare studies underlying assumptions governing calculation chance expected agreement require units coding performed chosen sensibly comparably
