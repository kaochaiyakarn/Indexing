trust important 
business settings trust required order coworkers partner organizations effectively 
trust partners share information openly transactions carefully contracted monitored prevent exploitation 
workers may change nature collaborations avoid need close coordination may simply avoid collaborating altogether limiting productive capacity 
higher degrees trust established organizations efficiently adapt quickly changing circumstances 
trust best defined willingness vulnerable positive expectations actions 
previous research shows difficult develop trust online setting face face

careful analysis multi condition data may help clarify affects cmc arise conditions 
method person groups played social dilemma game called 
experimental research trust measured games called social dilemmas 
known social dilemmas include prisoner dilemma problem commons 
social dilemmas defined situations best interest group conflicts best interest individual looks lose 
social dilemma maximum group benefit accrues individual agrees act cooperatively 
social dilemmas vary difficult depending exact rules payoff structure generally takes amount time communication order reach required level trust

trust situations results apply 
trust broad concept encompassing situations individuals put risk 
social dilemma tasks experiment elicit exploitative behaviors measure interpersonal trust related types risks 
kinds trust 
definitely 
professional setting collaborators need trust mundane things partners return phone calls time competent give sales pitch distant client remain financially solvent 
followup studies field laboratory continue identify specific trust issues relevant distance 
different kinds trust completely independent 
developing trust partner exploit start developing trust fulfill obligations 
underlying processes trust development delayed fragile trust underlying psychological mechanisms social applicable different kinds trust 
guidance research offer managers developers time 
findings suggest richer media generally better trust building trust maintenance face face gold standard 
workers need strategic situations demand trust 
planned collaboration involve new collaborators workers familiar 
opportunistic behavior particular danger current collaborations 
results may help managers allocate scarce resources travel expensive cmc channels 
key limitations study relatively short duration student age subjects 
research needed laboratory field settings relationships develop time multiple interactions 
wilson straus presents interesting model follow research lab extending scope direction
