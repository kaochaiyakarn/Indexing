ka techniques sorting sorting standard ka technique building taxonomies 
experts sorting exercise set entities asked divide set subsets think aloud tape recorder 
sorting build classification smokers 
started initial classification motivated stages change psy theory divided smokers categories pre intending quit anytime soon seriously considering quitting definitely decided quit soon 
wished refine categories especially includes smokers ab area sorting 
basic exercise consisted giving doctor sets questionnaires set set set asking subdivide set sub sets 
repeated exercise different doctors 
results exercise complex doctors full agreement 
anal ysis proposed subdivide categories basis desire quit 
particular divided people want intend quit com smokers people mixed feelings smoking don intend quit clas sic people quit aren intending quit typically don think ll succeed lacks confidence 
doctors agreed reasonable subcategorisation proceeded basis 
particular categorisation follows added question easy questionnaire 
people answered put commit ted smoker category 
people answered sure looked decisional balance number likes dislikes smoking placed lacks confidence dislikes clearly numbered likes classic 
defined different high level schemas categories schemas essen tially specified sections cases paragraphs included leaflet tile detailed content individ ual paragraphs schemas commit ted smokers got short non argumentative ters gently reminded smokers drawbacks smoking suggested sources information smoker changed mind classic tors got letters focused draw backs smoking lacks confidence ers got letters focused confidence building ng barriers quitting addiction fear weight gain 
example leaflet shown incidentally lacks confidence smoker 
evaluation clinical trial underway attempted partially evaluate sorting derived categories doing differences tween smokers groups 
words hypothesised categories correct distinguishing different types smokers observe differences characteristics addiction confidence groups 
course ideal evaluation test hypothesis different classes smokers proposed receive different types leaflets difficult hypothesis test directly 
case analysis suggested ers group different character 
suggested done terms creating subgroups dif ferent characteristics purely easy question ignoring likes dislikes smoking 
analysis suggested ful basis addiction 
fact sorting exercises doctors mention dividing groups par tially basis difficulty individuals quitting implement 
statistical analysis suggested ways possibly improving content schemas 
example analysis showed committed smoker category included light smokers probably social reasons useful specifically address leaflets quit 
retrospect sorting exercise ful proposing ideas divide stages change categories new questions ask smokers 
process defining detailed category classification rules content schemas benefited greatly statistical data smokers target region 
data clinical trial started smokers returned ques time system changed 
difficult base smoker classification statistical smoker data certainly recommend approach projects data available outset 
think aloud protocols phrasing letters largely think aloud example sessions experts
