tcp modification document rfc updates rfc specifies increase permitted upper bound tcp initial window segment segments

allman standards track page rfc txt new tue oct rfc increasing tcp initial window october upper bound initial window precisely min mss max mss bytes note sending byte packet indicates maximum segment size mss bytes assuming ip tcp options 
limiting initial window mss bytes allows sender transmit segments initially common case byte packets 
equivalently upper bound initial window size mss follows mss win bytes win bytes win increased initial window optional tcp may start larger initial window 
expect general purpose tcp implementations choose larger initial congestion window equation 
upper bound initial window size represents change rfc rfc specified congestion window initialized segments 
change applies initial window connection round trip time rtt data transmission tcp way handshake

syn syn ack lost initial window sender correctly transmitted syn segment consisting mss bytes 
tcp implementations slow start different ways start new connection initial window restart transmission long idle period restart window restart transmission retransmit timeout loss window

connections able large congestion windows modification eliminates rtts delayed ack timeout initial slow start phase 
particular benefit high bandwidth delay tcp connections satellite links 

disadvantages larger initial windows individual connection high congestion environments particularly routers bias bursty traffic typical drop tail router queues tcp connection better starting initial window segment 
scenarios tcp connection slow starting initial window segment segments dropped tcp connection starting initial window segments experience unnecessary retransmits due inability router handle small bursts 
result unnecessary retransmit timeout 
large window connection able recover retransmit timeout result unnecessarily early transition slow start congestion avoidance phase window increase algorithm 
premature segment drops occur uncongested networks sufficient buffering moderately congested networks congested router uses active queue management random early detection fj rfc 
tcp connections receive better performance larger initial window burstiness initial window results premature segment drops 
true tcp connection recovers segment drop retransmit timeout tcp connection ultimately limited small congestion window network congestion receiver advertised window

duplicate segments described previous section larger initial window occasionally result segment dropped initial window segment dropped sender slow started initial window segment 
appendix shows case larger initial window result transmission large number duplicate segments 
segments dropped network larger initial window tcp increase number segments congested links dropped reaching final destination 
problem occur connections multiple congested links segments scarce bandwidth congested link path dropped path 
tcp connections congested link path 
segments dropped connections waste scarce bandwidth contribute congestion collapse 
network paths multiple congested links segments dropped initial window scarce bandwidth earlier congested links ultimately dropped subsequent congested links

typical levels burstiness tcp traffic 
larger tcp initial windows dramatically increase burstiness tcp traffic internet today traffic fairly bursty 
bursts segments typical tcp flo delayed ack covering previously unacknowledged segments received congestion avoidance causes congestion window slide segments sent 
delayed ack received slow start causes window slide segments incremented segment resulting segment burst 
necessarily typical bursts segments tcp rare 
assuming delayed acks single dropped ack causes subsequent ack cover previously unacknowledged segments 
congestion avoidance leads segment burst slow start segment burst generated 
changes progress reduce performance problems posed moderate traffic bursts 
change deployment higher speed links parts network burst bytes represent small quantity data
