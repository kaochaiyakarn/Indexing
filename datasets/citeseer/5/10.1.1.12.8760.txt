background related notion temporal locality recognized denning definition working set set unique contained fixed number past 
early domain program memory opposed web requests 
refer simply object situations distinction significant virtual time meaning time discrete advances unit object 
increased temporal locality generally improves cache performance 
demand driven cache designed store subset objects previously accessed cache property objects held cache higher likelihood accessed near random collection objects 
streams show temporal locality recency useful metric base cache management policies 
despite extensive studies temporal locality defined loosely leading differing approaches analysis 
competing definitions tend appear definition object just referenced high probability referenced near definition object just referenced increased probability referenced near 
definition accurately capture spirit temporal locality definition better captures importance temporal locality caching systems 
reason definitions appear literature term appears applied 
distinction precise specific formalization temporal locality 
consider stream set objects pi denote probability object object occurs 
say particular object shows temporal locality exists pi object shows temporal locality distance independent probability formalization helps see temporal locality arise ways exist object simply popular peers pi second exist object occur correlated manner pi certain number authors focused ways temporal locality arise 
separation formalizes notion definition contrast definition formalized discussed property decreasing probability object increasing time 
temporal locality effects suggested jin bestavros eager williamson 
jin bestavros termed effects popularity temporal locality eager williamson term concentration popularity consider kinds temporal locality distinguish popularity correlation 
probably best known characteristic web streams highly skewed popularity distributions usually characterized term zipf law 
zipf law states popularity th popular object proportional generally zipf distributions approximate web streams 
distribution probability th popular object typically 
practical implication zipf distributions streams concentrated small fraction objects referenced 
returning definition temporal locality implies small subset objects pi zipf law results strong temporal locality probability referencing certain objects greater near ubiquity zipf distributions web authors value metric capturing popularity skew :10.1.1.12.2253
number reasons take different approach 
note important terms temporal locality deviation pi values directly captured zipf exponent 
direct measure deviation available entropy 
entropy random variable possible values probability pi simply pi log pi 
properties exactly desire measures deviation distribution uniform distribution 
takes maximum value log inthe case realizations equally pi takes minimum value zero case observation occur outcome deterministic 
second reason preferring entropy zipf exponent real data fit zipf distribution perfectly 
result measurement zipf exponent subjective show section iv 
strength entropy metric requires underlying modeling assumption data captures popularity skew equally trace adheres zipf distribution 
ieee ieee infocom having identified appropriate metric capturing popularity remains develop metric correlation component temporal locality 
attempts characterize correlation focus way object separated objects 
widely approach stack distance model 
object corresponding stack distance number unique undefined stack distance 
motivation metric derives relationship behavior cache managed lru replacement policy directly generate synthetic workloads 
studies stack distance capture characterize temporal locality web request streams authors stack distance transformation tool cache sizing workload generation 
stack distance fit needs distinguish causes temporal locality directly 
noted authors consider popularity correlation capture difference kinds temporal locality modified stack distance model 
propose stack distance normalized factor effects long term popularity allowing characterized separately 
propose similar approach normalizing stack distance 
approach take characterize correlation directly simpler intuitive metric stack distance 
approach starts simpler metric inter distance 
considering unique intervening object consider total number intervening including appear multiple times 
advantage metric kinds temporal locality way stack distance 
see consider sequence symbols fixed alphabet 
change popularity symbol replacing occurrences symbol stack distance properties symbols potentially affected correlation properties symbols changed 
true inter distance metric purely measure correlation 
side important benefit inter distance faster simpler compute stack distance 
inter distance measure temporal locality 
inter distance jin bestavros measure correlation follows lead regard 
add approach ways measure request correlation distribution inter distance equally popular objects may mix objects varying distributions inter request times separate inter request distances object
