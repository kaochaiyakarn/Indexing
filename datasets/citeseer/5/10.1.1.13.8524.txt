obtaining spectral signature process obtain spectral signature piece music shown 
steps follows 
divide audio signal frames 
frame obtain spectral representation 
representations possible long distance measure available compare frame frames sound similar close 
implementation mfccs 
features prevalent speech recognition applications 
discrete cosine transform log amplitude mel frequency spectrum compared euclidean distance measure 
spectral measures include amplitude spectrum directly representation mp coefficients 
sequence transformed frames song cluster frames groups similar 
number clusters may fixed song case standard means clustering 
alternatively number clusters chosen dependent song 
set clusters characterized mean covariance weight cluster denoted signature song 

comparing songs obtain spectral signature song interest

objective relevance examine goodness relevance top songs returned system response query song 
user tests expensive time consuming objective tests tune parameters system identify trends true average database 
examine objective definitions relevance songs style songs artist songs album 
song database analyze closest songs returned 
table shows average number songs returned system genre query song

mfcc average number songs genre features closest closest closest table average number closest songs genre seed song nr 
mfcc average number songs artist features closest closest closest table average number closest songs artist seed song genre query song 
tables show similar results relevance defined songs artist songs album 
see average song artist album closest songs 
results disappointing noticed informal tests due large database distance measure typically finds songs different artists acoustically similar songs artist album 

subjective relevance appears cepstral features give best retrieval performance 
conduct user tests configuration 
tests compare playlist generated system playlist generated random song database 
independent users participated test 
playlists randomly selected songs 
song randomly generated playlist playlist generated system 
users instructed rate song playlist similar similar query song 
interestingly users naturally assumed audio similarity say similarity 
agreement users songs similar songs rated differently 
average number similar songs nr 
mfcc average number songs album features closest closest closest table average number closest songs album seed song algorithm average number similar songs closest closest closest random proposed table average number similar songs playlists generated random similarity measure judged users queries nr 
mfcc times original song returned features closest closest closest table percentage times original song returned closest songs query clipped version original songs playlists shown table 
despite preliminary nature tests results encouraging confirm noted informal tests 
average top songs returned similar system opposed random playlist generator 

robustness corruption investigate robustness distance measure clipping songs 
songs database remove section random length randomly selected place song 
calculate signatures song 
corrupted song measure find closest songs clean database 
ideally original version corrupted song song returned 
table shows percentage times original song returned closest songs corrupted version query 
see numbers quite high indicating distance measure robustness type corruption 

described method compare songs solely audio content 
evaluated distance measure database songs 
preliminary objective subjective results show distance measure preserves aspects perceptual similarity 
songs judged users saw average top songs returned perceptually similar 
saw measure robust simple corruption audio signal
