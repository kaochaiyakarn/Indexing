expressive power defined semantics process language deserves central role product selection 
aspect considered small number business process management projects 
business process analysis aims investigating properties business processes obvious trivial 
term analysis broad meaning including example simulation diagnosis verification performance analysis 
process simulation facilitates process diagnosis sense simulating real world cases domain experts acknowledge correct modeling propose modifications original process model 
business process models expressed process languages clear semantics structural properties analyzed 
example certain parts processes reached obvious modeling mistake occurred fixed 
basic structural properties process models studied time remarkable software products support 
structural analysis process models requires clear formal semantics underlying process language
