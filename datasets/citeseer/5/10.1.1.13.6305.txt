room vision systems person tracking intelligent room track people moving conference area room hz 
room person tracking system uses cameras approximately ground 
debugging window system showing view cameras shown 
initially decided incorporating tracking system intelligent room essential number reasons 
gives room ability know people inside including people enter exit 
room able determine objects people example show data video display near

example moving near video display seated conference table indicate giving presentation 
tracking data useful supplying information systems room including surprise speech understanding system 
clear start tracking disambiguate room modalities example providing foveal area gesture recognition 
providing contextual information room speech recognizer revealing example modality help overcome weaknesses

people differentiated system color histograms clothing room builds come inside 
room configuration fairly static cameras tracking stationary tracking system build model room relatively slowly changing background compare incoming images 
tracking subsystem controls steerable cameras

approach differs overhead tracking system described bobick 
domain high ceilings quite reasonable look people single camera bird eye perspective 
rooms ordinary height ceilings possible stereo vision system necessary performing background segmentation 
pointing intelligent room overhead lcd video projectors display room walls 
display output room workstations composite signals room video sources vcr 
projected displays support finger laser pointing interactions 
example room track finger person pointing inches wall images displayed 
alternatively person laser pointer interact display distance 
pointing systems allow displayed screen objects selected clicked moved dragged 
additionally pointing systems allow people treat displays virtual whiteboards 
room draw visible trail top displayed image follows continuous path pointing gesture 
allows people overlay handwritten text drawings top information room displaying 
automatically recalled date example room shows information 
finger pointing system uses cameras mounted parallel wall side displays 
scan lines camera image explore region closest wall surface 
laser pointing system uses camera roughly orthogonal plane display wall locate laser distinctive signature wall surface 
systems run approximately hz depending precise type interaction provide resolution display ranging approximately laser pointing finger pointing 
pointing systems sufficiently responsive discrete pointing dragging events handwriting recognition mentioned drawing feature practical doubling sampling frequency 
interactive table ceiling mounted camera room detect hand pointing gestures newly placed documents surface conference table 
gesture recognition system support wide variety functions described dang 
making gestures surface table particularly natural form interaction required extensive practice master 
widely observed graphical user interface community increased novelty interface necessarily lead increased utility 
pertinent domains intelligent room stress natural modes interaction 
useful application system allows people place post notes surface table assign particular functions dimming lights announcing current time 
touching note evokes assigned behavior intelligent room 
mnemonic function note handwritten giving table feeling virtual non standard control panel 
room oblivious written information notes long doesn interfere color segmentation allows individual notes recognized 
issues person tracking system uses neural network perform reconstruction 
tracking network trained laying masking tape coordinate system room floor training network having person stand intersection axes 
grid roughly 
non network approaches reconstruction possible directly calculating reverse projective transformation require user intensive preliminary learning period determine transformation room image space 
installing tracking system labor intensive requires familiarity operates 
difficulty approach system enormously sensitive deviation training conditions 
example cameras moved cm tracking system fails function 
automatic recalibration possible natural artificial environmental fiducials practice difficult detect highly intrusive added environment 
cameras moved rotated requires retraining neural network non technical user want 
accidental computer vision research world performed rooms windows 
computer visions systems particularly ones rely background segmentation extraordinarily sensitive environmental lighting conditions 
example early intelligent room development ambient light coming newly opened door completely disrupt room vision systems 
early design flaw general extremely difficult compensate changing lighting conditions 
shadows particularly difficult phenomena cope took great pains avoid 
disabled room overhead fluorescent lighting upward pointing halogen floor lamps 
additionally selected fairly dark colored carpet better shadow masking 
tracking system color correction mechanism shadow elimination 
static color correction scheme partially useful tracking cameras affected dynamic lighting projected video displays 
solutions research agenda computer vision systems hal changed drastically approach intelligent room 
incorporating state art visually interactions far interested robust vision systems require little calibration essentially self training 
enabled room vision systems reinforce 
example multi person tracker may temporarily lose people occlude blend background 
way help offset finger pointing system provide information useful tracking 
finger pointing projected display standing near position room floor 
knowing pointing tracker focus attention section room 
conversely tracking system allows room identify person pointing wall 
determining tracked person closest pointed position room distinguish inhabitants finger pointing gestures 
various devices room interact vision systems 
software agents control room electrical lights notify vision systems affect room ambient lighting 
allows vision system recalibrate deactivate conditions favorable correct operation restored avoids incorrect event recognition due luminosity changes 
dynamic person tracking essential design intelligent room clear retrospect vast majority tracking system output thrown away 
applications need real time trajectory information room occupants 
particularly important know stops moving sitting piece furniture crossed particular threshold room doorway

look people rest places expected sitting couch standing display people crossing narrow defined region doorway 
implemented experimented systems call static person locators threshold detectors

systems algorithmically quite simple far sensitive environmental variations initial tracking system 
proved quite robust initial detection accuracy varying light conditions wide range individuals 
creating generic chair locators ceiling mounted vision system 
assumption occlusion chair provides evidence sitting person located prior knowledge chair position 
system low dimension eigenspaces approximating object manifolds varying pose lighting conditions stauffer 
advantage approach system need advance explicit model chairs locating 
system construct object manifolds having user rotate new types chairs brings inside 

speech interactions earliest decisions regarding intelligent room support spoken language interactions 
particular interested allowing interactions unimodal ones tie user video display verify correct utterances recognized system require keyboard selecting possible alternative utterances 
wanted avoid simply creating keyboard replacement allowed speech commands substitute actions ordinarily performed typing mouse clicking 
wanted allow interaction multiple applications simultaneously interactions user 
process tried allow intelligent room engage dialogs users gather information correct misunderstandings enhance recognition accuracy 
people intelligent room wear wireless lapel microphones transmit speech understanding system described 
default room ignores spoken utterances inhabitants generally directed people room 
state known room asleep obtain room attention user stops speaking moment says word computer loud 
room immediately responds audible quiet chirp overhead speaker indicate paying attention 
user second window speaking room 
room unable recognize utterances starting period silently goes back sleep explicitly addressed 
user says recognized room responds audible click circumstances returns sleep 
hands eyes free style interaction coupled audio feedback allows user ignore room computational presence explicitly needs communicate 
need preface spoken utterances cue computer enable verbal interaction 
user interact room easily regardless proximity keyboard monitor 
intelligent room capable addressing users festival speech synthesis system black 
utterances spoken room displayed scrollable lcd sign case user unable understand said 
room uses speech capability variety purposes include conducting dialogs users getting occupant attention resorting visual display 
room chooses respond question video displays occupied considers high priority information 
example user asks weather forecast new york city room simply read forecast user put weather map containing forecast information displays occupied 
processing spoken utterances summit zue speech recognition systems parallel 
different strengths fairly robust performance 
summit system recognizes continuous speech particularly adept handling syntactic variability recognition 
entering bigram models fairly straightforward build topically narrow syntactically unconstrained sets recognizable utterances 
bigram models quite difficult exclude particular statements erroneously recognized system require heavily post process summit output 
performed primarily start natural language information retrieval system katz 
commercially available system primarily discrete speech dictation meaning users pause word 
coupled relatively low word accuracy intolerable speech interface room 
supports explicit construction continuous speech context free recognition grammars 
special library provides complete control low level aspects room vision systems continue function respond users listening verbal input 
behavior external applications ideal incorporating systems 
issues tradeoff making room recognition grammars sufficiently large people express somewhat freely versus making grammars small system runs high accuracy real time 
tuned performance creating sets specialized grammars different room contexts having room software agent controller dynamically activate different subsets grammars depending context activity intelligent room coen 
allows overcome combinatorial increase parsing time due incorporating natural syntactic variability recognition grammars 
keeping single enormous recognition grammar active room keeps subsets small grammars active parallel currently expects hear 
key assumptions certain types utterances said particular circumstances circumstances room capable distinguishing 
may related spatially history previous interactions room applications active gesturing devices room doing simplest level range saying video playing complex dependencies asking weather geographic entity brought room attention 
generalized notion linguistic context include state room put contextual knowledge room software agents linguistic data structures 
example room starts showing video clip agent controls showing videos activates grammars involve vcr operation 
clip stops grammars turn deactivated 
interesting cues involve location inside room 
fact moved near interactive displayed map causes room pay attention spoken utterances involving geographic information 
information room systems help overcome computational limitations room speech recognition understanding systems 
verbal interactions extremely useful dealing room modalities 
gather information room observing modify internal representations state correct perceptual error 
enormous benefit able verbally interact room vision systems developing debugging generally impossible manually interact workstation remaining cameras fields view 

experience intelligent room led reevaluate initial assumptions highly interactive environment designed 
intelligent environments need rough previously existing systems 
particular careful selection communication modalities lead synergistic reinforcement reliable system 
modalities carefully selected order environment easy install maintain wide range environmental conditions 
systems dynamically adjust room activity speech understanding system systems train avoid extensive manual calibration essential success
