classification hierarchical levels embody evolutionary structural relationships 
family 
proteins clustered families basis criteria imply having common evolutionary origin proteins residue identities greater second proteins lower sequence table facilities databases scop links identities functions structures similar example globins sequence identities 
superfamily 
families proteins low sequence identities structures cases functional features suggest common evolutionary origin probable placed superfamilies example actin domain heat shock protein flaherty 
common fold 
superfamilies families defined having common fold proteins major secondary structures arrangement topological connections 
scop give fold short descriptions main structural features 
different proteins fold usually peripheral elements secondary structure turn regions differ size conformation divergent cases differing regions may form half structure 
proteins placed fold category structural similarities probably arise physics chemistry proteins favouring certain packing arrangements chain topologies see 
may cases common evolutionary origin obscured extent divergence sequence structure function 
cases possible discovery new structures folds previously known structures clear common evolutionary relationship
