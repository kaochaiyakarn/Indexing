xml received considerable attention database community typically views xml documents semistructured data 
astonishing amount community aiming coping xml data primarily motivated data exchange integration 
instance storing xml data developing new technologies leveraging mature ones indexing querying xml content updating xml data benchmarking xml applications 
furthermore database industry adopted xml aggressively major dbms vendors provide support xml form native xml data management systems available 
due lack accurate characterizations xml documents web development tools widely guided folklore xml documents shallow known publicly available xml documents proprietary xml content

recursion final study analysis xml documents total contain recursive elements 
reasons studying recursion xml web simple 
recursion naturally captured xml documents schema specifications considerable impact performance query processors storage mechanisms xml 
study complementary characterizes recursive dtds web 
purposes say element recursive exists element document descendant label 
simplicity call element descendant association pair 
recursive xml tree xml tree rooted recursive element leaves recursive descendants root tree 
reasons apparent shortly different interpretations count pairs 
consider xml tree 
descendants interpretation ad shown elements recursive descendants element 
closest descendants interpretation cd elements considered recursive descendants element 
interpretations element recursive descendant element 
statistics pairs sample 
total recursive xml trees elements contain recursive descendant pairs ad interpretation pairs cd interpretation

distance 
study recursive xml content concerns distance xml tree elements recursive descendants 
measure distance counting number edges separating nodes xml tree 
instance distance elements 
figures show distribution pairs distribution distance paired elements 
graphs plot common pairs elements distance quick look ad plot shows recursive xml trees depth levels cd plot shows recursive elements separated path length contain elements label 
results justify need ad cd interpretations ad interpretation describes global properties recursive xml trees cd interpretation describes local properties related recursive element descendants 
evidently observations derived interpretation instance graphs show elements pairs distance

distribution follows 
regularity average distance elements pairs document 
study cd interpretation provides better reading 
see consider recursive tree average distance cd interpretation consider subtree obtained deleting element tree average distance new tree intuitively say recursion second tree regular distance elements pairs constant equals average 
notion regularity describe advantage extremely simple compute 
easy see misleading different labels recursive tree consider xml tree containing pairs elements labeled distance pairs elements labeled distances 
regularity tree despite fact distance elements pairs label constant 
better notion regularity take different labels account 
documents recursive content single label pairs simple notion regularity incurring significant error 
results regularity simple metric described shown 
draw reader attention observations documents average distance re statement results lot regularity recursion documents 
highest values uses cd interpretation documents total average distance documents average distance documents average distance 
shows documents recursive content exhibit high regularity 
equivalent plot ad descendant interpretation note permits similar reading expected 
recursive fan 
important parameter studying recursion xml documents call recursive fanout element number recursive descendants element number pairs element appears column 
ad cd interpretations provide complementary readings 
ad interpretation measures total number recursive elements recursive xml tree 
precisely semantics xpath expression form label recursive element 
recursive fan cd interpretation hand viewed branching factor recursive xml trees intuitively measures wide xml tree gets function distance root tree 
note recursive fan means recursive tree gets taller wider distance root increases 
shows distribution recursive elements average recursive fan cd interpretation shows equivalent plot ad interpretation 
see distributions follow power laws 
note similar notion regularity applies cd interpretation observe common average fan outs elements total elements 
average recursive fan elements largest recursive fan element
