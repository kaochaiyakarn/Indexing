crc press llc iii semantic conference organizer kevin heinrich michael berry jack dongarra university tennessee knoxville contents overview background latent semantic indexing software issues creating conference extensions overview organization technical meeting workshop conference involving submitted abstracts full text documents quite onerous task 
gain sense topic submission addresses may require just quick glimpse title 
automated indexing text mining revolutionize manner speed information assessment organization 
demonstrate latent semantic indexing lsi probing labeling conference abstracts intuitive web interface client server internal software design grid middleware netsolve 
automated text parsing keyword extraction facilitated general text parser software developed utk department computer science 
background creating conference manually burdensome task 
papers submitted human organizer group papers sessions 
session topics decided organizer feel material covered papers 
session topics pre conceived crc press llc statistical data mining knowledge discovery organizer select papers fit topic 
option subject material covered papers discern natural clusters form create sessions accordingly 
case assigned particular session belong session 
exclusivity causes papers grouped sub optimal arrangements topic constrained number papers assigned 
average conference papers submitted organizer shuffle papers topics trying find workable fit papers sessions assigned 
course person trying fit papers sessions lose context quickly 
switching rapidly sessions cause confusion renaming sessions assigning different topics may cause entire conference get 
times human organizer document surrogates simply title papers misclassified due summarization errors 
note significant amount time spent reading re reading abstracts remember subject manually creating conference takes day week longer 
combinatorial problem confronting person manually organizes conference need sort automated assistance justified hopes reducing hours spent creating conference 
latent semantic indexing order semantic conference organizer useful replace time consuming tasks undertaken creating conference reading 
techniques algorithms field information retrieval enable relevant documents retrieved meet specific need requiring user read document 
model semantic conference organizer latent semantic indexing lsi 
document collection received parsed called tokens 
punctuation capitalization ignored 
addition articles common non distinguishing words discarded 
effect document viewed bag words operations performed 
bag words formed term document matrix created entries matrix weighted frequencies associated corresponding term appropriate document 
weight term document nonnegative value describe correlation term corresponding document 
weight zero indicates correlation 
general weight product local global component 
simplistic method obtaining weights assign local component frequency word document global component semantic conference organizer log proportion total documents number documents term appears 
method known tf idf term frequency inverse document frequency weighting scheme 
aim scheme measure similarity document time measuring dissimilarity document documents collection 
semantic conference organizer uses log entropy weighting scheme 
local component global component computed log pi log pi log pi fi frequency ith term jth document probability ith term occuring jth document number documents collection 
weighted frequency token computed multiplying local component global component 
term document matrix defined aim log entropy weighting scheme high frequency words giving distinguishing words higher weight 
term document matrix created truncated singular value decomposition matrix performed create factor matrices matrix eigenvectors mm matrix eigenvectors diagonal matrix containing nonnegative singular values 
size factor matrices determined rank matrix component submatrices compute ms rank approximation case considerably smaller rank document document similarity computed ms ds ds derived original formula rank approximation 
queries treated pseudo documents computed ks query vector associated term weights 
result lsi reduced space compare documents broader level 
goal map similar word usage patterns geometric space 
effect documents compared general sense concepts compared vocabulary 
statistical data mining knowledge discovery software issues semantic conference organizer designed assist human organizer creating conference tool automating conference creation 
great care taken information user overloading user information time 
basic actions organizer performs create conference reading papers creating sessions grouping papers form sessions 
document collection submitted screen split frames aforementioned actions take place 
right frame responsible creating deleting modifying session names bottom frame shows papers semantically fit session give user ability group papers session left frame allows user browse particular document 
illustrates splitting window frames enables user maintain local global view document collection 
furthermore allows requested information transmitted network time greatly reduces load time 
discovered attempt creating organizer delays incurred cgi quite significant attempting maintain global perspective document collection transferring entire document collection page load 
document collection submitted text parsed keywords extracted general text parser gtp 
singleton words allowed keywords abstracts small 
allowing singleton words allows user query specific person get intuitive results 
lsi applied document collection keyword extraction 
log entropy weighting scheme see section ensure distinguishing words carry weight 
queries document collection processed query module gtp 
subsequent queries routed query module need re parse document collection server access 
functions organizer accomplished scripts simple text files 
singleton word occurs entire document collection 
singleton words discarded information retrieval algorithms singleton usually distinguish document collection meaningful way

simple query weather documents supercomputing conference produce output shown 
document collection submitted frames appear 
right frame list queries 
new query added placing bottom frame 
clicking skull session delete entire session clicking skull query delete query

clicking query show ranked list documents query bottom frame 
clicking specific document title show entire document left frame 
checkboxes document titles lock documents query assign specific session 
document locked specific www sc org shtml statistical data mining knowledge discovery return list generated query weather 
session locked original lock released 
locked documents appear white font document locked session black document locked query chain session 
topic produce expected results user may wish modify topic slightly 
accomplish added ability chain queries 
chaining queries quick way compare results different queries 
context organizer chained query query viewed time 
documents appeared top queries marked inform user particular document done fairly job matching previous query terms 
case organizer documents initially colored blue 
query chained results new top colored red 
multiple chains documents number parentheses title indicating number consecutive queries document appeared threshold 
chaining particularly useful see effects single word return list 
typing chained query append new query previous 
power chaining seen figures 
chaining allowed user append modeling initial query weather 
seeing desired papers appearing top return list user switched query weather related words 
user misspelled word semantic conference organizer note misspelling temperature 
notice sixth document new top 
statistical data mining knowledge discovery temperature 
chaining quickly notice impact correct spelling temperature return list sixth document returned 
second document locked session weather 
useful function chaining occurs trying find session title 
documents locked chain queries documents high return list 
high return list session title semantic tie documents returned hopefully helpful start finding session title topic 
note figures user locked papers weather session 
seen user initially tries global modeling session title unsatisfactory success 
changing chained query simply modeling notes documents appear top return list 
ideally papers separate similar hopefully distinguishing way trying create session title 
create final conference simply click create conference button 
list produced list sessions list locked documents appropriate session 
parentheses document name chained query document locked 
session title chain query followed initial session title parentheses 
semantic conference organizer third final document locked session benchmarks benchmarking effectiveness conference organizer difficult task session groupings highly subjective

extensions currently processing storage document collection done webserver 
conference organizer deals document surrogates abstracts performing svd computationally intensive 
natural extension allow remote processing remote storage grid enable possibility increasing size document collection include full documents 
grid middleware netsolve icl cs utk edu netsolve semantic conference organizer factor larger term document matrix lsi 
server burdened performing computationally intensive tasks response time inevitably improve 
temporary nature information tool distributed storage software internet backplane protocol ideal way store matrix document collections 
small adjustments possible sake convenience 
ability index full documents viewing abstracts small conveniences 
alternate methods transfer document collection ibp method nice extensions
