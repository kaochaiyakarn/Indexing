system architecture architecture anemos types components 
client module constitutes user interface system coordinator central component responsible scheduling measurement tasks data collection analysis worker modules components interact measurement tools hosts monitored paths 
describe component detail 
clients anemos client web applet 
written compiled jvm run browsers relying java plug browsers jvm 
client provides login options regular users system administrator 
fig 

monitor new path regular user mode interface provides main operations 
monitor new path tab shown user specify monitored path selecting hosts run anemos workers 
user chooses measurement tool start time time time interval iterations 
second add new rules tab user form data analysis rules specify corresponding alarms 
rules syntax described detail section 
third view previous results tab shown figures user see previous ongoing measurement tasks initiated visualize results 
graphs generated component mrtg

administrator mode interface provides user mainly operations 
ability review terminate necessary ongoing measurement tasks 
second add remove worker process remote host 
versions system administrator able edit ongoing measurement tasks rules list available measurement tools 
example measurement proven intrusive possible schedule frequently 
client modules communicate coordinator strongly typed protocol 
consequently anemos fig

workers anemos workers charge operations hosts monitored paths 
execute appropriate tool measurement task 
second worker module source host path communicates worker module running destination host coordinate measurement task third workers read measurement tools output gather final results send data coordinator storage analysis 
note general active measurement requires cooperation source destination hosts path 
workers tool independent anemos assumes measurement tools return values referred principle measurements performed tool long wrapper script tool perform appropriate parsing tool output feed worker just numbers 
instance case udp ping implementation user modify corresponding wrapper script change semantics collected values

system architecture worker worker coordinator process uses threads 
client handler thread responsible interacting user adding new tasks rules corresponding queues calling mrtg create visual representation measurements 
worker listener thread responsible collecting results measurement task corresponding remote worker storing arriving measurements mysql database 
important thread coordinator surveyor 
thread maintains scheduling queue measurement tasks initiates aborts experiments remote workers evaluates rule gathered measurements 
coordinator centralized entity anemos may contradict distributed nature system 
role coordinate experiments exchanging short messages workers performing cpu intensive network intensive operations 
reason believe centralized nature coordinator impede scalability anemos 
furthermore having results stored single database ensures rule evaluation data plotting visualization purposes produce additional network traffic 
releases system include secondary coordinator running remote host act backup case primary coordinator fails

measurement tools anemos extensible open new measurement techniques actual measurement tools embedded system 
relatively easy plug new tools system 
current implementation anemos supports measurement tools variation ping measure rtts loss rates pathload measure endto available bandwidth 
measure path rtt forward path packet loss rate wrote udp variant ping 
contrary known ping utility tool requires cooperation hosts path 
tool uses udp forward reverse path packets allows user specify number packets sent time interval packets msec packet payload bytes see 
measure available bandwidth path pathload 
available bandwidth network path maximum throughput provide flow aggregate rate cross traffic pathload sends periodic short udp packet streams source destination 
basic idea pathload way delays periodic packet stream show increasing trend stream rate larger available bandwidth 
tool uses iterative algorithm rate probing streams converges interval called grey region available bandwidth varies 
security authentication anemos supports multiple users performing measurements visualizing results time 
consequently system provide authentication 
system encryption communication passwords clients coordinator 
current implementation crypto java package developed provide encryption 
client wants establish connection coordinator starts 
initializes diffie hellman key exchange triple des ensures data sent encrypted decrypted automatically 
provide authentication communication protocol clients coordinator requires messages include username password requesting user

current implementation support type alarm 
rules correlate measurements different paths 
comparing rtts available bandwidth diverse paths choose optimal routes overlay network detect congestion overlap different paths 
example disjoint paths merge access link web farm exhibit simultaneous significant loss rate increase assume access link congested 
similar correlations diverse paths provide clues occurrence distributed denial ofservice attack flash crowd
