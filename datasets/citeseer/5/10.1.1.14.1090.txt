conventional information retrieval focuses primarily information provided text documents web documents provide additional information way different documents connected hyperlinks 
particular information call predecessor pages pages hyperlink pointing target page may contain useful information classifying page 
consider set pages shown 
target page shown bottom contain information author 
predecessor pages inferred person question professor union pages reveals information university students colleagues 
reasons information predecessor pages improve performance text classifier web pages redundancy quite page pointing single page web 
ability combine multiple independent sources information improve classification accuracy witnessed success ensemble techniques areas machine learning 
independent encoding set predecessor pages typically originates different authors provided information sensitive vocabulary particular author 
example uninformative target page recognized professor home page predecessor pages 
sparse non existing text web pages contain limited amount text 
fact pages contain images machine readable text 
looking predecessor pages increases chances encountering informative text page classify 
irrelevant misleading text pages contain irrelevant text 
target page example 
cases pages designed deliberately contain misleading information 
example pages try include lot keywords comments invisible parts text order increase breadth indexing word search engines 
fact predecessor pages typically authored different independent sources may provide relevant information improve focus 
foreign language text english predominant language web 
documents languages occur non negligible numbers 
text page written foreign language may incoming links pages written english 
cases allows english speaker text classifier english vocabulary infer contents page

excellent overview research area nowadays referred web mining 
surprisingly potential hyperlinks additional information sources text categorization tasks looked research 
previous hypertext categorization way addressed problem merging parts text predecessor pages text page classify keeping separate feature set predecessor pages

authors implemented relaxation labeling technique showed improves performance standard approach ignores hyperlink structure 
utility classes predictions neighboring pages confirmed results oh yang 
different line research concentrates explicitly encoding relational structure web order logic

example word means exists predecessor page contains word word 
slattery mitchell improve basic foil learning algorithm integrating ideas originating hits algorithm computing hub authority scores pages craven slattery combine favorably naive bayes classifier :10.1.1.120.3875
core features pages linked predicate identical approach evaluated chakrabarti words neighboring documents added separate feature set cases learner access features neighboring documents 
main difference lies fact relational representation learner may control depth chains link predicates may incorporate features pages links away 
practical point view main difference lies types learning algorithms approaches inductive logic programming typically relies rule learning algorithms try classify pages forming hard classification rules predict class looking selected features approach typically learning algorithms available features naive bayes classifier

obvious choice simply anchor text appears hyperlink 
experiments concentrate approach heuristics evaluated section 
implementation experimental setup ripper rule learner evaluated approach ripper rule learning algorithm available research purposes fromhttp www research att com diane html 
ripper efficient noise tolerant rule learner incremental reduced error pruning algorithm 
learning rule ripper splits available training data growing set usually data pruning set rest data 
learns single rules greedily adding condition time foil information gain heuristic rule longer incorrect predictions growing set 
learned rule simplified deleting conditions long performance rule decrease pruning set 
examples covered resulting rule removed training set new rule learned way examples covered rule 
ripper member family separate conquer covering rule learning algorithms 
post processing phase ripper uses global optimization algorithm allows re evaluate modify learned rules context rules 
ripper able deal text categorization problems set valued features 
basically ripper represents document set words represents document set words occur document disregarding order frequencies 
rule learning algorithms representation come natural commonly bag words representation represents document multi set bag words ignoring order frequency 
straight forward implementation set words representation encoding presence absence possible word separate boolean feature results inefficient encoding training examples space wasted specifying absence words document 
features allow specify set values single value conventional attribute value features 
document represented single feature lists words appear document 
ripper considers conditions form word feature 
conditions evaluated true example word part subset values feature example 
voting schemes discussed constructed training set consisting example predecessor page labeled class target page 
simplest case features set valued attribute consisted words anchor text cf 
section alternatives 
ripper trained training set producing single classifier 
ripper option unordered induces set unordered rules set rules class discriminating class classes 
order compute prediction target page classifier applied predecessor pages gave prediction 
combined voting scheme 
previous results similar studies ensemble techniques implemented various voting schemes confidence information incorporate information sure classifier prediction 
ripper returns single prediction probability distribution possible classes associate confidence score ripper predictions 
decided confidence score examples covered rule 
score laplace estimate probability ripper supports bag words representations allowing conditions form word encode fact word occur times 
option hardly literature encountered case significantly improved results 
experimented ordered rule sets results usually little worse 
ordered mode ripper treats class default class learn rules class 
tried round robin approach learns classifier pair classes outperform ordered unordered rule sets 
example covered rule positive estimated positive negative instances rule covers training set 
confidence estimate ripper uses internally tie breaking unordered rule sets multiple rules fire predict different classes example 
extension assign confidence score predictions rule sets individual classes fired prediction originate default rule rule simply predicts majority class 
ripper adds rules theory order guarantee full coverage example space 
reasons ignoring predictions default rules hand need full coverage individual predictions combined ensemble hand turned learned rules fairly low coverage examples classified default rule 
may happen quite frequently rules large number default predictions 
preliminary results may 
note example may covered multiple rules contradicting class predictions class may confidence score implemented voting schemes voting vote simplest technique give member hyperlink ensemble vote predict class receives votes 
ties broken favor larger classes predictions confidence score ignored 
weighted sum weight weight voting scheme identical previous technique confidence scores weight vote ensemble member 
predictions high confidence scores may rule larger number predictions lower scores 
weighted normalized sum norm voting scheme identical previous confidence scores normalized way distributes total weight different candidate classes link 
necessary confidence score associated class depends number positive negative examples covered best rule predicts class covers example 
confidence scores associated class interpreted class probability estimates normalized 
maximum confidence max combination method simply chooses class prediction receives highest confidence member ensemble predicts class
