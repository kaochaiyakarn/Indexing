note implicitly applied similar opacity enhancement temporal approach described section 
temporal rendering translated cursor images overlaying results results image having opacity 
obtaining opaque cursor images hd cursor uses requires bringing opacity back corresponds enhancing opacity factor higher visual weight generally cursor easier detect help users visually reacquire cursor additional visual weight may interfere user primary tasks may attract user attention occlude screen content 
design hd cursor addressed issue increasing visual weight cursor mouse speed exceeds certain threshold 
example shown cursor remains unchanged frames 
mouse speed exceeds onset threshold cursor images filled cursor image frame frame 
optional cursor scaling governed similarly motionless slow moving cursor normal size prevents potential usability issues target acquisition 
cursor slowly passes pixels target shrunk back original size users carry final part target acquisition cursor familiar size kensington

example shows lower onset threshold leads denser trail 
cursor trail density indicates mouse speed regular mouse cursor offers additional visual cue mouse speed distance individual cursor images 
larger distances indicate mouse moving fast shorter distances indicate lower mouse speed see example

smooth cursor path interpolation hd cursor peak number cursor images screen typically exceed number mouse location values mouse device provide full hardware sampling rate hz pc mice example 
locations additional cursor images determined interpolation 
choice interpolation function requires additional attention 
simple linear interpolation gives cursor paths polygon shaped appearance exposes users presence fake cursor images may harder users visually track cursor abrupt corners curve 
smooth interpolations typically created higher level interpolations cubic splines 
unfortunately cubic splines require knowledge path segments sides segment case hd cursor means past mouse coordinates 
type interpolation unsuitable waiting samples require delaying rendering cursor turn reduce perceived responsiveness mouse 
hd cursor uses interpolation solely past current cursor positions 
cursor images displayed single frame possible modify segments cursor images rendered hd cursor renders exactly curve segment frame
