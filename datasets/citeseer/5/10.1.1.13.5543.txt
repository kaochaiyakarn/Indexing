past decade face recognition received substantial attention researchers pattern recognition computer vision cognitive psychology communities see sur 
common interest motivated challenges designing machine vision systems match remarkable ability recognize people facial features increased attention devoted security applications growing need automatic image video archival human faces 
main challenge face recognition presence large intra class variability human face images due head pose lighting facial expression facial hair aging small inter subject variations due similarity individual appearances 
face recognition algorithms classified pose dependent pose invariant 
pose dependent algorithms face represented small number images appear ances different poses set viewer centered images 
hand pose invariant approaches face represented model object centered represen tation 
pose dependent algorithms classified major groups geometry approach uses configuration geometrical features face ii appearance approach uses holistic texture features iii hybrid approach combines facial geometry local appearance information 
geometry methods suffer insufficient number facial landmarks detected accurately appearance techniques unable tolerate variations head pose facial expression illumination 
pose invariant algorithms face models promising overcome mentioned variations difficult align face structure images cost sensitive acquire face shape
