intranets vs internet intranets basic structure internet collection documents connected hyperlinks qualitative differences intranets internet 
differences stem fact underlying content generation processes intranets internet fundamentally different 
internet tends grow content generation intranets tends bureaucratic consequence fact fairly centralized process exists small number individuals employees contractors assigned responsibility building maintaining pieces intranets careful review approval censorship content

discussion leads axiom 
axiom 
intranet documents created simple dissemination information attract hold attention specific group users 
fascinating aspect internet usually large number documents relevant reasonably natural query 
example uncommon query remove tree sap car internet search engine see wide variety pages provide advice vendors cleaning products helpful hints specialists random experienced situation 
hand intranets fairly common queries forgot intranet password reset place conference call office telephone tend small number relevant pages usually just 
search problem internet sense easier intranets reasonable subset pages topic considered answers tree sap query intranet search engine exact page queries kind mentioned considered poor 
trickier pages distinguished special way easily identifiable relevant certain queries 
yields second axiom implies ranking algorithm needs clues matching query terms web pages 
axiom 
large fraction queries tend small set correct answers unique unique answer pages usually special characteristics 
negative intranets 
biggest problems internet search spam intranets hand tend significantly prone manipulation web pages intent improve ranks 
consequently ranking heuristics extremely unreliable internet turn quite safe useful intranets 
anchortext information perfect example phenomenon 
example consider ranking heuristic says rank page highly query words part anchortext hyperlink points page dangerous heuristic internet prone misled spamming 
intranets may expect heuristic fairly reliable 
examples degree url depth gives third axiom
