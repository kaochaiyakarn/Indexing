done marking texts text passages relevant 
labeling texts fine grained procedure renders precise calculations word weights relevant texts contain interesting passages 
marking paragraph sentence requires fewer texts achieve precision amounts user 
suitable environment marking interesting sentences reduced mouse click may unreasonable 
methods granularity passage synonym text text passage sentence 
calculating word weights reduction words stems may performed different word forms count instance word 
experiments german texts skipping stem reduction lead results may different inflectional languages english 
ways compute word ranking possible 
tried simple successful described refer description alternatives include information gain word weights gained trained support vector machine 
collections relevant irrelevant passages fn absolute frequencies word respectively 
weight computed fn weight interpreted approximation probability passage containing word deals relevant topic 
note word weights computed long topic interest change 
note words separated context word meanings plays role relevant passages receive high weight occurs meaning passages 
problems polysemy similar argument synonymy moderated 
word corpus receives weight words high weights considered relevant topic list cut certain length example list 
sentence selection compression section describes word lists reduce text desired length selection compression ordering sentences 
selection truncated word list word unseen sentence assigned weight zero list 
sentence sum word weights divided word count bias longer sentences 
result compared threshold decide sentence domain specific extract 
find right threshold word list candidate thresholds minimum maximum tested collection labeled texts 
labeling done recall precision sentence extraction computed threshold gains highest value average recall precision chosen 
labeling done number sentences relevant texts candidate threshold minus number irrelevant texts maximised choose best threshold 
way threshold adjusted word list distribution weights 
threshold may instrument tune method user preferences 
high threshold lead extraction relevant information relevant sentences lost 
lower threshold achieves better recall meaning little relevant information lost irrelevant sentences 
compromise usually unavoidable 
compression character display selecting sentences longer text achieve reduction 
usually informative informative parts sentence possible compress sentences 
done careful way destroy structure sentences making extract unreadable 
example verb central sentence syntactically semantically deleted 
true negations 
results shallow robust syntactical parser give hints parts sentence important 
consider example sentences express information urgent user appointment cancelled 
friday meeting cancelled 
account friday morning 
unfortunately friday impossible 
cancellation friday meeting unavoidable 
crucial information verb adverbial account subject attribute impossible subject 
basically relevant information may show syntactical structure 
list topic words possible cancel parts sentence contain topic related words making important information retained 
hand syntax analysis provides useful tool consider different levels reduction 
levels allow reduce sentence flexibly far necessary 
table shows different levels determined structures shallow parser german experiments section provides linear sequence phrases dependencies 
level includes replacement certain words common abbreviations 
level marked special way useful resort level earlier subordinate clause contain topic words remaining sentence strongly reduced big impact readability 
hand unnecessary remove clause reduction level 
empirically average reduction achieved levels clause deletion half extracted sentences corpus described table 
reduction levels level delete weight zero deletion words articles adjectives adverbial phrases prepositional phrases noun phrases subordinate clauses section 
clause removal done summary length compression double size desired summary length done level point meaning sentence hardly damaged 
solutions easily implemented 
scheme tested german texts see section artificial english example meant give impression reduced sentences look different reduction levels 
levels applied reduction stopped level original sentence 
character alerts readers deleted words 
mo 
having mo 
hello having lunch monday 
note monday prepositional phrase cancelled receives positive weight word list monday replaced common abbreviation mo deletion noun phrases cases radical compare example produces unreadable sentences 
cases certain factual fragments times dates money amounts extract achieved level 
done information extraction technology possible set maximum reduction level user preferences 
final extract formation extracts desired maximum length sms messages order presenting selected sentences issue may possible accommodate sentences compression

sentences compressed necessary compressed level level outer loop starting level zero deletion prespecified maximum level atmost

sentence fit completely cut necessary

method allows trade readability informativeness vice versa readability prioritized maximum reduction level set low leave sentences extract cases 
setting high maximum level sentences fit extract considerably compressed may provide information reader knows context message example 
evaluation section describes experimental data experiments selection accuracy informativeness reduced texts evaluated 
data test domain specific extraction small sets german texts collected deal common topic 
set consists emails words related scheduling announcement meetings 
second set contains newspaper articles words reporting results public elections 
sets complemented equally emails newspaper articles random domains respectively provide background calculation word weights 
texts labeled percent sentences topic related respectively 
stem reduction tagging shallow parsing german nlp tool successor smes 
domains chosen comparatively suitable information extraction tasks certain structural items table 
sentence selection results texts recall precision fallout emails articles times dates percentages salient items show domains business reports 
look resulting word lists reveals times dates weighted high appointment scheduling domain word percent receives low weight election results domain best indicators mandate vote evaluation bias due easily recognizable items limited 
selection accuracy main criteria successful selection recall precision measured sentence granularity 
precision value depends proportion irrelevant texts collection irrelevant texts increase likelihood wrong positive classifications 
fallout addition defined ratio wrong positive classifications negative irrelevant sentences 
low fallout means little irrelevant information 
table shows results collections fold cross validation including standard deviations 
extraction easier appointment domain satisfactory election results 
fallout low 
second experiment word lists computed labeling see section 
lead sentences emails low election results probably due smaller size collection 
labeling texts sentences sufficient word list method texts 
extract informativeness mentioned specific summaries easier evaluate generic ones possible set specific questions readers 
intrinsic evaluation done sms messages characters resulted reducing appointment related emails 
sms messages formed emails little medium strong reduction levels respectively informants different original reduced texts shown versions text 
text asked kind meeting text dealt supposed take place takes part meeting announced canceled confirmed understandable text scale 
correctness answers measured differences answers short messages seeing email 
time meeting survived compressions 
status confirmation cancellation inferrable emails sms messages little medium strong reduction respectively 
information concerning place participants meeting rare original texts hardly survives compression proper names receive high weight 
questions answered average emails strongly reduced messages 
readers gave average emails little medium strongly reduced extracts respectively 
taken means important information time status appointments preserved reduced messages strong reduction avoided little information inferred resulting texts 
better leave sentences extracts compress lightly preserve readability 
concluding remarks shown ranked lists words related topic filter reduce texts respect topic 
explicit knowledge semantic relations words list needed semantic relation assumed implicitly words high weight significant positively labeled texts 
methods gain lists 
lists applied parallel users recycle lists build filters range interesting topics 
word lists semantically extend syntactic methods compress sentences allowing stronger reduction certain purposes
