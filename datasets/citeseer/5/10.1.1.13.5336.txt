propbank currently annotates sentential verbs leaving adjectives nominalizations stage 
annotation scheme requires verbs coarsely disambiguated 
disambiguation done largely basis differing argument structures avoids subjectivity word sense distinctions wordnet 
example verb leave major senses depart give sentence possible wise trace leave specific operations presidents 
easily determined fact arguments labeled arg arg arg 
predicate argument annotation embedded clause roughly base leave tense infinitival arg presidents arg specific operations arg trace notice annotation explicit referent trace instantiates arg leave 
labels allow capture similarity transitivity alternations example john arg broke window arg window arg broke 
possible transitivity alternations occur predicate argument structure instances verb 
carry arguments arg arg mother carrying baby bond carrying yield crystals carrying currents viruses carrying genes 
data product project twofold containing annotated text linked lexical resource called frames files 
annotation annotations form notation referring syntactic terminals original treebank files wsj wsj mrg rel arg tmp corresponds human readable form fournier noted navigation joined core shareholders said holds just shares 
rel arg trace tmp frames files labels order ensure consistent annotation provide annotators detailed comprehensive examples verb syntactic realizations corresponding argument labels 
starting frequent verbs series frames drawn describe expected arguments roles 
general procedure examine number sentences corpus select roles occur frequently semantically necessary 
roles numbered sequentially arg potentially arg role mnemonic label 
labels tend verb specific lead framenet labels tend general verb classes labels follow naming conventions theta role theory 
number roles varies verb minimum zero maximum 
typically verbs take roles hit hit sense strike arg hitter arg thing hit arg instrument hit odd verb take arguments normal state affairs weather verbs hail sense pellets ice sky outside 
maximally verbs quantifiable motion take arguments edge sense move slightly arg causer motion arg thing motion arg distance moved arg start point arg point arg direction publishing unit reported revenue edged 
verb buy expected roles buy arg buyer arg thing bought arg seller bought arg price paid arg bought subsequent examples taken treebank 
agentive argument occur verbs quantifiable motion certainly possible john edged car feet forward front fire ups truck 
purchase buy sell arg buyer arg buyer arg seller arg thing bought arg thing bought arg thing sold arg seller arg seller arg buyer arg price paid arg price paid arg price paid arg arg arg table comparison arguments semantically related verbs rarely roles occur single easily obtained framenet role descriptions sentence 
example labels defined superset level 
hand bought wheel loader 
arg specificity propbank frames difficult determine larger classes verbs 
rel bought arg wheel loader arg tv stations bought record prices 
arg tv stations rel bought arg arg record prices 
possible consistent semantically related verbs 
buy purchase similar sell seen table 
detail note transaction arg seller role buy equivalent arg seller role sell vice versa 
information extraction application specific rule showing mapping arguments relationship commodity transaction template 
machine translation information extraction buyer seller need remain distinct applications information retrieval merged superset easily regarded equivalent verb roles commerce frame framenet propbank exchange commodities cash framenet commerce arg buyer arg commodity seller arg payment arg cash price goods arg rate unit table comparison propbank framenet correspondence framenet propbank roles insignificant 
propbank derived verb specific frames relatively easy reconstruct subject agent role specific verbs 
buy sell purchase indicate buyer seller appears subject position 
information superset identical trade 
variety additional roles assumed apply verbs label variety secondary tags 
tags augment function tags treebank considered fundamentally different numbered arguments theoretical argument adjunct distinction merely arguments numbered higher 
include loc location neg negation marker tmp time mod modal verb mnr manner ext extent numerical role dir direction prp purpose cause adv general purpose modifier table secondary tags addition tag prd marking secondary predication cases argument verb predicate argument verb 
helps underline important distinction mary called john idiot 
label mary called john cab 
arg mary arg mary rel called rel called arg john item labeled arg john arg prd idiot attribute arg cab thing table prd tag comparison resources large corpus actual usage enables discovery senses previously predicted resources 
example framenet equivalents propbank quantifiable motion frame including verbs rise fall increase decrease forth resource predicted existence add sentence nasdaq composite added heavy volume 
context clear point second operand mathematical function 
sense absent framenet 
framenet contrast small subset sentences usually picked best illustrate roles verb question 
approach examples clearer informative frequently interesting important senses 
different corpora framenet propbank difficult compare results projects framenet corpus chosen avoid ambiguous complex sentences 
benefit basing semantic classes real data avoiding spurious membership 
quite closely propagated errors 
levin tends include conceivable verb classes neglecting stalk included class follow class pit peel 
propbank practice framing verbs frequency corpus membership semantic class served quickly cover semantic classes english statement true framenet 
quarter verbs framed propbank corresponding entry framenet coverage smaller coverage come price classes incomplete membership 
may number verbs class propbank usually small fraction shortcoming solved class information generate frames files automatically discussed 
propbank includes large number phrasal verbs go blow pass currently numbering 
phrasal verbs usually syntax semantics quite distinct non phrasal bases 
resources neglect altogether 
automatic expansion frames frames currently place nearly verbs average added week 
combination existing frames resources allows frames quickly extended cover verbs 
example verb destroy shares class verbs occur treebank ruin waste 
frames verbs created exact copies destroy frame loss accuracy case waste required second sense handle examples waste away 
similarly great number repeated negated actions state restate load unload generated automatically 
approach highlighted mistaken assumptions inherent previous efforts verb classification 
verbs grouped basis semantic syntactic similarity neglecting intersection considerations 
example quantifiable motion verbs obviously include verbs rise fall takes arguments object motion distance start endpoints 
separate class holds verbs drop just arguments agent thing dropped possibly adjuncts describing direction goal source 
common usage equally true drop synonymous fall sentences governments borrowing authority dropped 
drop regarded cause fall allowing syntaxes merged single argument verb 
analysis elements previously regarded adjuncts direction source forth treated arguments 
similarly verbs edge inch quantifiable motion verbs bearing inherent meaning motion fairly minimal 
rise fall inherently carry direction motion inch edge describe motion direction just possible edge forward inch downward forth 
verbs follow framing conventions rise fall necessary addition argument describing direction 
resulting class quantifiable motion verbs partially syntactically consistent combination semantics syntax consistent member verbs 
procedure accuracy number annotators undergraduate linguistics majors extend templates frames remainder examples corpus 
rate annotation reasonable rising predicates person hour currently tagged 
learning curve steep annotators requiring days master aspects task course occasional bizarre syntax confuse experienced annotators 
agreement varies widely generally high ranging low high measured number constituents agreeing disagreeing tags verb lemma 
agreement rate generally rising high rate annotator turnover obscure fact average runs slightly 
places predicate argument tagging accuracy accuracy part speech tagging word sense tagging 
discrepancies tend arise misunderstandings part annotators proper annotation style actual disagreements proper tagging errors easily caught corrected 
example annotator consistently incorrectly included verbs saying source sentence intel told analysts resume chips weeks kate said arg intel arg resume chips weeks arg analysts erwin said arg intel arg resume chips weeks arg analysts annotation uses double blind procedure followed catch correct discrepancies 
step takes hour verb regardless number sentences verb 
usually annotator output close gold standard identity annotator varies sentence john gave mary flowers count possible disagreement points arguments verb 
inclusion verb scoring metric necessary catching correct phrasal variants 
verb verb 
agreement rates annotators gold standard varies low high 
correlation number sentences tagged rate agreement unsurprisingly degradation agreement number arguments verb frames increases 
verb expected arguments naturally shows higher disagreement rates verb reflecting complexity task 
summary described approach development proposition bank involves addition semantic information penn english treebank 
order achieve consistent annotation rely explicit frames files verb provide annotators labeled examples syntactic semantic variations verb 
detailed comparison frames files framenet frames discussed attempts verb classes automatically extend frames files 
concluded summary current status annotation process 
rate progress achieved inter annotator agreement figures provide reassuring evidence task feasibility
