determining amount credit charge node discuss basic questions 
question pays 
considering relay message sender destination transaction need decide charged message receive credit relaying message 
charge destination decide charging sender robust general approach 
reasons charging sender 
charging destination may allow nodes launch denial service attack destination sending large amount traffic 
sharing cost sender destination similar problem sender collude intermediate nodes secretly return sender payment back destination pays traffic 
hand sender charged node incentive send useless messages 
second destination benefits content message pay sender get compensation destination example application layer payment protocol 
reasons sender charged system 
closely related question receive credit forwarding message 
ideally node tried forward message compensated forwarding message incur cost node matter successful 
forwarded message may corrupted link way verify forwarding action occur 
local wireless networks ieee provide link layer acknowledgments acknowledgment schemes universal refrain changing basic network functions 
decision credit node receives depend forwarding action successful forwarding successful node path receives message 
words ccs believes node forwarded message successor node path reporting valid receipt message 
objectives payment scheme second basic question objective payment scheme 
objectives payment scheme prevent cheating actions provide incentive nodes cooperate 
objectives system target balanced payment require total charge sender equal total credit received nodes message 
fact order prevent type cheating actions ccs charges sender gives nodes see section iii 
order offset long term net outflow credit mobile nodes ccs large network ccs periodically returns credit back mobile nodes uniformly ccs periodically gives mobile node fixed amount credit 
note return enable cheating action reduce incentive nodes forward messages 
cheating actions receipt submission game mobile nodes selfish proper payment scheme may forward messages may try cheat system cheating maximize welfare 
particular selfish node exhibit selfish actions receiving message node saves receipt forward message node received message report receipt node receive message falsely claims received message 
note selfish actions complicated collusion nodes 
progressively determine requirements system order prevent actions 
motivating nodes forward messages order motivate selfish node forward messages ccs give credit node forwards message node forward message 
basic scheme achieve objective follows 
ccs determines node path received message 
ccs asks sender pay node predecessors 
note ccs ask sender pay successors node 
comparing scheme observe approaches just special case small close 
illustrates basic idea example 
example intermediate nodes submit receipts 
nodes receive payment node payment 
node destination submit receipt receive credit 
sender pays total 
sender node node node node fig 

illustration payment scheme version 
destination motivating nodes report receipts obviously single node having received message motivated report receipt greater cost submitting receipt discussed previously low receipt generally small 
unfortunately collusion design 
example node general case nodes received message collude sender 
particular node report receipt sender saves node ieee ieee infocom loses 
sender gives node scene compensation node better sender enjoys net gain 
colluding group gets net benefit 
order prevent cheating action ccs charges sender extra amount credit destination report receipt message 
extra charge goes ccs nodes 
charge sender including payments nodes extra charge charge sender message arrives destination number nodes submitting receipts 
extra charge colluding group benefit cheating action 
consider example 
shows revised amount paid sender equal 
sender node node node node fig 

illustration payment scheme version 
destination preventing false receipts consider countermeasure third type selfish actions 
discussed order save bandwidth storage system requires nodes submit receipts full messages 
scheme receipts group colluding nodes try attack system ways 
example forwarding message intermediate node forward receipt message successor sufficient getting credit 
intermediate node wait fast connection successor forward false receipt saving resource usage 
key prevent attack depends destination 
distinguish cases destination intermediate nodes destination collude intermediate nodes 
consider case destination intermediate nodes submits receipt message receive message 
case argue intermediate nodes destination paid cheating happened message destination destination submit receipt message indicating received message 
sender needs sure destination receives message protocol validate receipt message destination easily implemented see 
consider case destination collude intermediate nodes 
case intermediate nodes forward receipt message message destination able receive valid message payload submit receipt message 
observation prevent potential cheating action intermediate nodes greatly reducing amount credit intermediate nodes message reported received destination 
reduction credit cheating nodes get credit cover minimum expense needed type cheating cost forwarding receipt 
exact destination report receipt message multiply credit paid node exact requirement section 
consider example 
shows revised amount credit received node 
particular comparing due revision reduce charge sender node path report receipt
