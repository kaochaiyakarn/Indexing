sd clarans adopt heuristics computing silhouette coefficients developed kaufman rousseeuw 
survey alternative criteria see

notice silhouette coefficient necessarily decrease monotonically increases 
value small distinct clusters incorrectly grouped leading small silhouette width 
hand large natural clusters may artificially split leading small silhouette width 
natural silhouette coefficient highest
