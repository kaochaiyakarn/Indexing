term genre refer widely recognized class texts defined common communicative purpose functional traits provided function connected formal cues commonalities class extensible 
example editorial prose argument expressing opinion matter immediate public concern typically written impersonal relatively formal style author denoted pronoun

ratios correlate certain ways genre widely previous
