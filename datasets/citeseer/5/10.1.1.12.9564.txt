opposed networks dedicated nodes support basic networking functions packet forwarding routing ad hoc networks functions carried available nodes network 
reason assume nodes network eventually cooperate network operation consumes energy particularly scarce resource battery powered environment manet 
lack cooperation nodes network new problem specific ad hoc environment goes name node selfishness 
selfish node directly intend damage nodes causing network partitioning disrupting routing information mainly performing kind attacks expensive terms energy consumption simply cooperate basic network functioning saving battery life communications 
damages provoked selfish behavior underestimated simulation study available literature shows impact selfish behavior terms global network throughput global communication delay dsr protocol 
simulation results show little percentage selfish nodes leads severe degradation network performances 
mechanisms detect prevent selfish behavior available literature take core mechanism 
core node cooperation stimulated collaborative monitoring technique reputation mechanism 
node network monitors behavior neighbors respect requested function collects observations execution function 
observed result expected result coincide observation take positive value take negative value 
collected observations node computes reputation value neighbor 
formula evaluate reputation value avoids false detections caused example link breaks aging factor gives relevance past observations frequent variations node behavior filtered 
furthermore function monitored provides message route reply message dsr protocol reputation information gathered nodes radio range monitoring node 
case positive ratings assigned nodes participated execution function totality 
core mechanism resists attacks performed security mechanism negative ratings spread nodes impossible node maliciously decrease node reputation 
reputation mechanism allows nodes manet gradually isolate selfish nodes reputation assigned neighboring node decreases pre defined threshold service provision misbehaving node interrupted 
misbehaving nodes re integrated network increase reputation participating network operation

non cooperative games approach second approach analysis focused identification preference relations specific selfishness problem design utility function satisfies structure 
utility function model selfishness problem takes account energy node spends purpose communications energy node participating routing protocol relaying data packets behalf nodes 
node behavior represented percentage energy node communications percentage energy spent network operation

nodes act equilibrium point necessarily best operating point social point view pricing emerges effective tool enforce cooperation nodes ability guide node behavior efficient operating point 
pricing factor chosen settle game socially desirable operating point reputation value calculated execution core mechanism 
utility function modified follows bi bj ni self pf ni term corresponds normalized reputation value assigned node ni dynamically evaluated neighbors depending past strategy adopted node ni 
pricing factor modify position maximum equation respect equation evaluated circumstances 
dynamically modifying position maximum possible impose selfish node change strategy fair behavior possible see
