subjective clustering order detect trends tendencies collections courseware material necessary find outliers groups outliers 
users typically want exactly specify complete profile users profiles tend change major problem recommender systems want give user views existing educational media 
conventional clustering techniques provide answer purpose 
typically clustering give single optimal view learning components

developed clustering mechanisms allow provide subjective views documents hotho underlying ontology 
instance view may concentrate differences similarities content learning material view may concentrate presentation form levels skills experiences needed

courseware watchdog comprehensive approach supporting learning needs individuals fast changing working environments lecturers frequently prepare new courses upcoming topics 
edutella peer peer network courseware watchdog provides personalized flexible access learning material offered web 
functionality achieved tying focused crawling subjective clustering flexible conceptual browsing ontology evolution
