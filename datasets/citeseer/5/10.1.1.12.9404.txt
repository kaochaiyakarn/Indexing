multimedia retrieval mark language mrml xml communication protocol content query developed separate query interface actual query engine 
specially developed cbir contains tags query positive negative examples 
detailed technical description 
mrml server listens port messages 
connecting mrml client requests basic server properties 
mrml message looks server informs client capabilities name similar simple messages client request list collections available server descriptions ways queried 
client open session server configure needs user interactive client needs benchmark test 
basic query consists list images corresponding relevance levels assigned user 
example user marked images jpg positive jpg negative 
images referred urls 
image location viper unige ch jpg user relevance image location viper unige ch jpg user relevance server return retrieval result list image urls ordered relevance query 
key successful extension mrml graceful degradation 
means servers clients recognize xml element attribute encountered mrml text ignore contents completely 
extensions designed standard information remains available generic mrml user 
principles provide guidelines independent extensions mrml 
avoid conflicts differing extensions mrml planned maintain central database registration documentation mrml extensions
