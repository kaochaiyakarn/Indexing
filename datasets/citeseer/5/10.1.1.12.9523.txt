table gives high level overview major advantages disadvantages different techniques tried different techniques useful types knowledge best suited acquiring classification section 
table shows technique clearly best different strengths weaknesses 
probably acquiring correct knowledge nlg best ka strategy mix different techniques discuss section 
directly asking experts knowledge simplest obvious ka technique nlg simply ask experts write texts question 
sumtime experts initially gave spreadsheets flowcharts describing thought texts generated 
projects turned experts description texts generated fact match people wrote texts question 
common finding ka partially due fact difficult experts examine knowledge practice anderson proponents expert oriented ka prefer structured ka techniques 
example sumtime gave spreadsheet designed essentially encoded thought parts weather forecasts generated spreadsheet generate complete weather forecast 
analysed logic spreadsheet largely version sumtime logic 
goal analysis create algorithm decide change parameter value significant mentioned weather report 
spreadsheet context dependent change thresholds decision 
example change wind speed mentioned change knots final wind speed knots change knots final wind speed knots change knots final wind speed knots 
context dependent thresholds reflect usage weather reports users case oil staff making decisions related north sea offshore oil 
example user deciding unload supply boat moderate changes wind speed don matter low speeds light winds minimal impact supply boat operations high speeds boat won attempt unload heavy winds may affect decisions speeds 
context dependent thresholds expected vary specific forecast recipient set consultation recipient 
perspective main pieces knowledge encoded algo rithm 
absolute size change determines mentioned 
threshold significance depends context ultimately user information 
reiter sripada robertson validation direct expert knowledge checked rules comparing observed corpus analysis manually written forecasts section 
suggested probably correct may incorrect 
particular linear segmentation model sripada basically looks changes slope changes absolute value parameter better matches corpus texts 
expert designed spreadsheet model agreed segmentation probably better approach 
essentially commented reason absolute size model easily comprehensible programmer expert numerical data analysis techniques 
words addition problems knowledge reasonable expect domain expert able write sophisticated data analysis algorithm expertise 
issue knowledge needed purely declarative ai applications need procedural algorithmic knowledge bear mind domain experts may sufficient computational expertise express knowledge computer algorithm 
role directly asking experts knowledge expert spreadsheet sumtime far ideal extremely useful starting point 
specified initial system build fairly easily produced vaguely plausible output 
fact happened doctors gave flowchart certainly weaknesses useful initial specification relatively easy build somewhat plausible system 
sumtime nlg projects involved having initial prototype system working soon possible useful developing ideas explaining domain experts interested parties trying 
terms types knowledge mentioned section flowchart sumtime spreadsheet specified domain knowledge example smokers categorised domain communication knowledge example ranges single numbers communicate wind speed 
flowchart specify generic communication knowledge english grammar morphology author probably believed knew things 
spreadsheet effect include english grammar rules just get spreadsheet author confidence 
summary think directly asking experts knowledge excellent way quickly build initial system especially nlg developers supply communication knowledge domain expert may possess 
initial system place probably best ka techniques poorly understood areas nlg 
applications solid theoretical basis expert simply say build system theory expert direct knowledge may needed 
acquiring correct knowledge nlg structured expert oriented ka think aloud protocols numerous types structured expert oriented ka techniques including think aloud protocols sorting structured interviews scott 
focus think aloud protocols technique 
tried structured ka techniques sorting reiter describe broad structured ka techniques similar think aloud protocols 
think aloud protocol expert carries task question case writing text thinking aloud audio video recorder 
think aloud protocols sumtime 
especially important provided basis content phrasing rules 
simple example think aloud process follows 
doctors wrote letter smoker tried managed weeks starting 
doctor comments think aloud transcript tried smoking 
longest managed week right months encouraging managed said people goes succeed 
included paragraph letter wrote smoker see managed smoking occasions gone back smoking glad know common people smoking attempts past succeed 
show capable stopping short period means able permanently somebody stopped smoking 
analysing session proposed rules previous attempt message succeed previous attempt message people unsuccessful attempts final system incorporated rule ka sessions just stated smoker tried letter included section confidence building confidence building section include short message previous attempts 
smoker managed quit week mentioned message message mention reiter sripada robertson recency smoker previous cessation attempt past months 
actual text generated rule example letter don feel confident able try things favour 
stopped month 
note text produced actual code considerably simpler text originally written expert 
fairly common simplifications logic decide include message letter 
cases due expert having knowledge expertise computer system reiter dale pp 
general process deriving implementable rules nlg systems think aloud protocols art science different experts write texts different ways 
validation structured ka knowledge attempted verify rules acquired think aloud sessions performing series small experiments asked smokers comment letter compare versions letter 
rules supported experiments example people general liked recap smoking likes dislikes see reasons section 
general negative finding experiments tailoring rules insufficiently sensitive unusual atypical aspects individual smokers smokers probably unusual atypical way 
example letters go medical details smoking think aloud expert written letters contained information right choice smokers smokers say liked see medical information smoking 
example think aloud sessions adopted positive tone try scare smokers right smokers smokers said approach effective 
fact experts tailor letters ways may possibly reflect fact tailoring appropriate relatively small number specific cases considered think aloud sessions 
think aloud sessions experts looked different smoker questionnaires questionnaires considered experts 
may sound lot drop bucket consider tremendously variable people 
comments smokers clinical trial reiter robertson osman revealed problems think aloud derived rules 
example decided include practical information letters people currently intending smoking smoker comments suggest mistake 
fact experts include information think aloud letters people 
decision include information influenced stages change theoretical model behaviour change states advice inappropriate people currently intending retrospect decision probably mistake 
acquiring correct knowledge nlg repeated think aloud exercises months originally performed went back experts gave questionnaires analysed months earlier asked think aloud writing letters questionnaires 
letters expert wrote second session somewhat different ones originally written preferred smokers letters originally written reiter 
suggests experts static knowledge sources learning task writing tailored smoking cessation letters course project 
surprise experts attempted write letters getting involved project 
role structured expert oriented ka structured expert oriented ka certainly useful way expand refine generally improve initial prototypes constructed basis experts direct knowledge 
focusing actual cases structuring ka process learned things experts mention directly 
obtained types knowledge mentioned section working experts relevant expertise 
example acquired domain knowledge medical effects smoking doctors domain communication knowledge words psychologist expertise writing patient information leaflets communication knowledge graphic design layout graphic designer 
structured expert oriented ka problems including particular coverage variability 
mentioned sessions examined smoker questionnaires possibly give coverage population smokers complex variable people 
variation fact different experts wrote texts different ways difficult extract rules think aloud protocols 
mistakes regard giving information people currently intending smoking 
focused single expert order reduce variation 
experiences suggested different experts better different types information experts changed time see substantial variation texts single author observations raise doubts wisdom usefulness single expert strategy 
short complexity nlg tasks means large number structured ka sessions may needed get coverage fact numerous ways write texts fulfill communicative goal means different experts tend write differently analysis structured ka sessions difficult 
corpus analysis years great interest natural language processing areas ai machine learning techniques acquire knowledge relevant data sets 
example building medical diagnosis system trying understand expert doctors diagnose diseases analyse data sets observed symptoms actual diseases statistical machine learning techniques determine symptoms predict disease 
similarly building english grammar working reiter sripada robertson form unknown total usage wind statements forecaster expert linguists analyse large collections grammatical english texts order learn allowable structures grammar texts 
collections texts called corpora natural language processing 
growing interest applying techniques learn knowledge needed nlg

corpus analysis refers machine learning statistical techniques analyse collections naturally occurring texts 
corpus analysis sense word possible collection naturally occurring texts doctors currently write personalised smoking cessation letters 
briefly considered analysing example letters produced think aloud sessions machine learning techniques texts believed successful learning especially high variability experts 
words primary strength corpus analysis ability extract information large data sets large data sets extract information corpus analysis loses value 
sumtime able acquire analyse substantial corpus human written weather forecasts data files forecasters looked writing forecasts sripada 
details corpus analysis procedures results reiter sripada sripada repeated 
validation corpus analysis knowledge rules acquired corpus analysis valid rules problematical primarily due factors individual variations writers writers making choices appropriate humans nlg systems 
simple example individual variation problems causes follows 
things attempted learn corpus express numbers wind statements 
initially searching common textual realisation acquiring correct knowledge nlg number 
resulted rules said expressed expressed 
probably acceptable forecast include leading zeros single digits include leading zeros 
probably acceptable mix forecast rules led 
usage individual forecaster shown 
table suggests individual forecaster consistent forecasters include leading zeros forecasters include leading zeros 
fact consistent omits leading zeros example uses 
reason statistics favour individuals differ descriptions wind speed prefer 
example explicitly mentions low wind speeds knots uses generic phrases mix generic phrases explicit numbers low wind speeds uses explicit numbers uses generic phrases 
forecasters especially strong preference numbers 
means statistics vs dominated forecaster explicitly mentions low wind speeds prefer numbers statistics vs dominated uses number lot avoids generic phrases odd numbers 
somewhat odd result corpus favours 
example means unique 
reiter sripada explain complex analysis corpus goal determine common time phrase time similarly led unacceptable rules largely individual differences forecasters 
obvious methods deal problems caused individual variation 
example restrict corpus texts author major drawback significantly reducing size corpus 
sophisticated model learning rule single digit numbers expressed separate rules number 
analyse behaviour individuals identify choices presence leading zero vary individuals consistently individual choices parameters user nlg system specify 
option probably best nlg systems reiter sripada williams sumtime leading zero choice 
main point simply trouble just accepted initial corpus derived rules question 
corpus researchers course aware result corpus analysis depends learned example rule realise rule realise single digit numbers features learning example just number number author 
complex analyses analysis time phrase choice rules reiter sripada result depends algorithms learning alignment 
dependence corpus analysis choices means results particular analysis guaranteed correct need validated checked just results ka techniques 
best approach nlg perspective identifying individual variations letting user choose reiter sripada robertson variation prefers requires analysing differences individual writers 
best knowledge published nl corpus analyses done part popular corpora include author information 
recurring problem corpus derived rules cases writers produced sub optimal texts particular shorter probably texts quicker write 
instance noticed parameter changed steady fashion forecast period forecasters omitted time phrase 
example wind rose steadily speed course forecast period covering calendar day forecasters write rising rising midnight 
statistical corpus analysis showed null time phrase common contexts cases 
common time phrase cases 
accordingly programmed system omit time phrase circumstances 
asked experts comment revise generated forecasts section told behaviour incorrect forecasts useful users included explicit time phrases rely readers remembering forecast periods ended 
words example forecasters doing wrong thing course meant rule produced corpus analysis incorrect 
don know forecasters discussions forecast managers mistakes forecast authors describing wind speed direction changing time predicted change different times suggested possible cause desire write forecasts quickly 
particular numerical weather predictions constantly updated customers want forecasts date prediction limit amount time available write forecasts 
fact perfectly rational human writers cut corners time limitations 
forecasters believe example quickly writing forecast minute date prediction data benefits date data outweighs costs abbreviated texts making right decision write shorter optimal texts 
nlg system faces different set tradeoffs example omitting time phrase speed nlg system means blindly imitate choices human writers 
problem fundamental individual variation problem solved appropriate choices learned features considered forth 
corpus analysis performed learns choice rules human authors 
rules inappropriate nlg system rules learned corpus analysis inappropriate ones regardless corpus analysis carried
