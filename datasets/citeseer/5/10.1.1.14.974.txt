drawbacks current approaches mobile systems need capable adapting wide range attributes network bandwidth location power general current middleware platforms provide support adaptive applications notifying applications certain interesting changes attributes occur bandwidth falls specified minimum level 
responsibility application adapt notifications appropriate way reducing bandwidth requirements 
approach shown lead inefficient solutions lack support enabling coordination adaptation policies multiple applications 
addition insufficient control implications having multiple possibly conflicting attributes triggering adaptation 
scenarios illustrate range problems occur approach adopted 
scenarios coordinated application adaptation power management scenario illustrates need coordination order achieve efficient power management mobile system 
existing approach handling power management acpi model enable operating system switch hardware resources low power mode 
example hard disk requested spin 
approach requires applications leave hardware resources idle state sufficient periods time transition idle active states worthwhile 
approach suitable application running mobile device approach prove inefficient multiple applications system services sharing hardware resources 
detail lack coordinated access hardware resources result poor utilisation shared resource sub optimum power management 
example consider case multiple applications implement auto save feature 
absence coordination applications application choose checkpoint state disk arbitrary time considering state disk spinning sleeping 
contrast applications able coordinate access hard disk access disk clustered allowing longer periods inactivity 
approach clearly power efficient situation usage completely arbitrary uncoordinated 
conflicting adaptation scenario illustrate potential problems occur system utilises separate adaptation mechanisms different attributes 
detail consider hypothetical mobile system hosts independent adaptation mechanisms managing power managing network bandwidth 
mechanisms conflict example illustrates 
system needs reduce power consumption power management mechanism request applications utilising network bandwidth postpone usage network device order place network device sleep mode 
consequence applications postponing network available network bandwidth increases 
network adaptation mechanism detect unused bandwidth notify applications utilise spare bandwidth 
way request utilise available bandwidth direct conflict request postpone network usage 
example highlights problem relying independent uncoordinated adaptation mechanisms 
coordination clearly required adaptation mechanisms example prevented conflict occurring 
specifically instruction applications utilise bandwidth withheld example conserving power system primary goal 
remote scenarios scenario consider client proxy server example web browsing proxy object required adapt behaviour context client see 
example client communicates proxy wireless link communication proxy server wired networks 
server wired link proxy compress proxy reduce bandwidth requirements wireless link 
bandwidth client proxy limited common solution compress data proxy perform decompression client 
limited processing power mobile device constraints extent decompression occur client potential reducing bandwidth transmitted stream 
furthermore implies processing demands applications mobile host direct impact potential reducing bandwidth requirements 
consequently reducing requirement bandwidth wireless link high priority achieved maximising available processing power decompression client possibly reducing allocation processing time processes 
addition level compression performed proxy correspond decompression capability priorities client 
example client upper bound bandwidth available transmission processing power may allocated decompression process 
graph illustrates provides range possible compression rates negotiated proxy 
particular little point proxy compressing capabilities client compressing insufficiently enable timely transmission network 
wireless link client decompress bandwidth compressed stream maximum available bandwidth wireless link maximum available processing power mobile host finding best compression rate processing load client 
additional complication scenario fact client necessarily sufficient information determine proxy object appropriate solution dealing problem perceived lack network bandwidth 
actual cause perceived low network bandwidth due problem server wired network 
cases proxy object entirely wrong solution fact add delay system 
example highlights desirability adopting approach turn requires monitoring components involved interaction
