average gains oar min hop combination show throughput increase produced oar protocol changing routing metric 
shown results oar provides quite substantial boost total network throughput 
gains provided oar come sources increased network efficiency due increased proportion time spent sending high rates reduced mac overhead due amortization multiple packet burst

mtm generally selects paths higher rate links min hop gains increased benefit reduced mac overhead high rate links provided oar 
mtm picks greater number high rate links receives benefit temporal fairness property oar helped case paths fast links available
