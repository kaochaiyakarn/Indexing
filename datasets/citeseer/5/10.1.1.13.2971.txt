self report approach motivation diagnosis direct communication student motivational state 
approach taken del design system learn unfortunately features needed read student motivational state operational version system evaluation effective features 
clear student motivational state affected having report motivation 
affected significantly easiest ways diagnose 
briggs put confidence judgments extremely simple elicit users give subjective ratings easily offer explanations different theories models identify factors affect motivation 
arcs model keller instance defines components influence motivation learn attention relevance confidence satisfaction 
interface easily implemented mechanisms allow student report subjective reading factors 
example factors represented slider manipulated student 
system lacks natural language interface

essa pentland cited developed facial recogniser showed accuracy recognising real time deliberately facial expressions group people 
roy pentland cited studied possibility expert second author 
computer discriminating approving sentences obtaining similar classification accuracy humans speaker dependent text independent classification 
methods detect motivational state student approach harder methods discussed previous sections 
hand seen emotional message conveyed non verbal communication sentic modulation approach may prove efficient way diagnose motivation 
addition problem efficiency motivation diagnosis consider difficulty applying methods current case physiological data possibly negative reaction students body sensors 
happen despite efficient way detecting human emotions limited certain type application consequence users reaction 
research areas worth pursuing new complex area motivation diagnosis list possible research directions extensive 
section simply main issues explored 
exploring communication channels 
research reviewed different communication channels possibilities studied 
example computer determine user pupils size changes different emotional states cited record mouse movements typing speed errors analyse posture part body 
eliciting motivation diagnosis knowledge 
cases independently communication channel main problem know pattern corresponds motivational state 
knowledge motivation diagnosis may elicited theories motivation observations human teachers common sense devise experiments test validity knowledge 
previously mentioned production rules del model student confidence increment large constant confidence value student succeeded solving problem help 
rule reasonable observations human teachers information available humans far information available computer system study knowledge sufficient detect student confidence level factors influencing decision 
devise experiments humans try diagnose student motivational state inspecting instruction interaction communication channels similar experiments mentioned section rosenthal maintaining channels available computer system instance case production rule mentioned information failure success performing problem information help requests 
type experiments start comparing accuracy different formalisations motivation diagnosis knowledge 
investigating self report approaches 
seen approach motivation diagnosis student self report probably easiest implement issues studied 
section mentioned example sliders represent important factors affect motivation 
investigate effect user approach student motivational state change having inform 
student updates sliders regularly certain extreme events happen 
find need update sliders regularly intrusive 
consider different ways self reporting motivational states example develop interface displayed representing different states bored anxious happy 
user select motivational state 
developing models motivation 
interesting research direction explored development predictive models motivation aids diagnosis 
picard describes models affective behaviour mainly emotion synthesis 
addition type models prove vital development truly motivating computer instruction 
probably human tutors react motivational states models motivation predict motivational effect possible actions select line action brings best possible outcome 
exploring motivation diagnosis models motivation 
consider possibility creating methods motivation diagnosis models motivation 
del considered simplicity behaviour pattern student certain motivational state basically 
similarly implement general models motivation predict motivation outcomes students 
human tutor surely knows student characteristics different students react differently tutor actions 
approach goal creating computers systems detect motivational states create model motivational behaviour face dilemmas access information 
place division public private emotional data 
reaction users 
argued state research area questions probably important 
answer questions give important hints point type research worth pursuing 
example informal survey students department surprisingly physiological data considered intrusive approach willingly 
hand monitoring keyboard mouse actions considered intrusive approach prefer 
formal study needed indicate intrusiveness system important factor deciding considered investigating different approaches motivation diagnosis 
focused issue motivation diagnosis believe crucial importance development truly effective 
reviewed different approaches taken computer motivation diagnosis generally emotion detection finding approaches offer definitive solution
