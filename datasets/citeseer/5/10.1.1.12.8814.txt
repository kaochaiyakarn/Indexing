approaches determining update frequency approaches decide update frequency data provider 
best estimation harvester estimates record update frequency learning harvest history 
syndication data provider may describe update frequency explicitly

push model data providers may directly push updates service provider side 
approaches best estimation syndication integrated current oai pmh model seamlessly 
algorithm adaptive model subscribe notify push models extend modify oai pmh model useful special cases kepler service 

best estimation harvester estimates record update frequency learning harvest history 
requires data provider constant update frequency 
studying harvest logs arc conclude section current oai pmh compliant repositories constant update rate rates vary dramatically site site 
difficult precisely predict update time specific repository 
harvester may necessarily provide freshness time example harvester may harvest repositories higher average update frequency frequently harvest repositories week save significant percentage update cost 
typically freshness requirement decided application 

syndication oai pmh response identify request may contain locally defined description containers express properties repository 
define optional container identifies update frequency data provider 
information provides alternate way build algorithm 
rss rich site summary syndication module provides syndication hints aggregators picking rss feeds regarding updated 
rss defines parameters define update frequency data source describes period data provider updated describe frequency updates relation update period defines base date concert calculate publishing schedule 
parameters provide syndication hints aggregators picking rss feeds regarding updated 
example file updated twice hour update period hourly rss specification define optional xml schema data provider describe update rate 
address repository comes know update rate scope oai pmh discussion address inaccurate repositories cf 

similar best estimation syndication container may accurate data provider able provide reasonable syndication container 
har 
xml schema syndication improve freshness allocating resources frequently changed repositories 

subscribe notify best estimation syndication compliant oai pmh framework relies constant update rate data providers may true applications 
data provider may notify service provider content changed 
subscribe notify promises optimal results 
useful repository low irregular update rate kepler framework 
model requires service provider actively listen notification adds implementation complexity service provider 
requires data provider keeps record subscribed service providers harvester issues oai pmh requests asynchronous fashion 
extend oai pmh additional notify verbs service provider side way optimize functioning oai pmh 
repository issues notify request inform service provider new data available 
harvester issue asynchronous oai pmh requests status 

push model repositories may directly push updates service providers 
case repositories decide push 
require data provider keep harvesting status 
implementation service provider supports new verb metadata attached post request 
push model provides additional benefits bypassing firewalls nat network address translation proxies 
similar subscribe notify model promises nearly optimal synchronization 
push model repository additional complexity saving status harvested subscribe notify model communication asynchronous status information saved harvester side 

synchronization repositories key issue oai pmh resolves 
compared general web crawlers oai pmh optimizes repository synchronization supporting incremental selective harvesting 
oai pmh repositories intention support wide range applications imperative study efficiency harvester freshness service provider 
define metrics describing synchronization problem oai pmh 
current update frequency oai pmh compliant repositories studied new methods introduced improve efficiency service provider staying synchronized large numbers data providers
