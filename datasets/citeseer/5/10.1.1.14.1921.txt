aim article indicate key properties document retrieval distinguishing data retrieval question answering summarize past experience field review external developments stimulating new interest text document retrieval consider specific strategies nlp research aimed form information processing 
purposes generally treat older term document retrieval newer term text retrieval synonymous 
aimed retrieving texts humans read paragraph book length

technological advances practical store search retrieve part full document text online 
essential requirements document retrieval dr general term distinction just relevant necessary refer text retrieval tr supplying user directly text 
information retrieval ir taken mean document retrieval global term covering data retrieval knowledge retrieval 
concentrate ir specifically dr nlp task 
document retrieval area ir dr proper important task distinctive properties confused data knowledge retrieval 
dr user wants find reading user generally ignorant opposed wanting specific data item question answered 
example take user wants read cheap production methods simple prefabricated housing 
imply user specific questions mind cheap production methods 
cheap expensive methods differ 
user questions mind aim get information questions reading documents suggest answered 
means dr find relationships information needs users information held documents considered general sense directly available computing system 
equally importantly relation user need meets necessarily obvious 
instance example need may met kirk reed mat design construction 
retrieval depends indexing means indicating documents 
indexing turn requires indexing language term vocabulary method constructing request document descriptions 
indexing base retrieving documents relevant user need 
supported search apparatus specifies conditions match request document descriptions modulation methods alter descriptions match initially forthcoming 
fundamental aim indexing increase precision proportion retrieved documents relevant recall proportion relevant documents retrieved 
achieve face kinds problems 
problems posed external context searching done instance typically relevant documents nonrelevant ones 
second problems imposed internal constraints task responsible characteristic uncertainty retrieval system overcome 
constraint variability ways concept may expressed :10.1.1.103.8364
partly matter language prefabricated vs unit construction underlying notion partly perspective prefabricated vs factory different views done 
second constraint request underspecification request vague cheap economical production vs cheap low quality incomplete housing vs temporary housing difference case user may realize ambiguity second failed give sufficient detail 
obvious characteristic dr problem follows user ignorance reading 
third constraint reduction documents descriptions descriptions indirect building reed mat hut partial construction design construction losing information different ways 
full texts documents increasingly available online degree reduction control indexing method past 
reduction completely avoided author document leaves subject 
forming compact descriptions significant content documents may increase efficiency matching effectiveness classifying textual material relevant nonrelevant just feature selection critical classification tasks 
dr imposes conflicting demands text descriptions asking normalizing accurate discriminating summarizing 
result variations indexing raise precision lower recall vice versa 
beating tradeoff raising recall precision fundamental goal constructing index language 
possibilities indexing languages

languages vary form emphasis placed terms term relations implicit explicit relations syntagmatic document request specific paradigmatic universally asserted relations

tests shown indexing documents individual terms corresponding words word stems produces results obtained indexing controlled vocabularies simple complex produced manual effort automatic language processing 
automatically combining single indexing terms multi word indexing phrases complex structures yielded small inconsistent improvements simple multiple terms query 
contrast statistical dr methods ease enhance representations single terms provided significant improvements alternative approaches boolean querying 
statistical dr methods rank documents similarity query estimate probability relevance query query document treated collections natural language sense drawing indexing terms document nlp referring natural language processing 
numerically weighted terms 
query arbitrary textual statement user information need sample document 
statistical dr methods assign higher numeric weights terms show evidence content indicators causing impact ranking documents 
number occurrences term document query set documents may taken account computing influence term document score 
addition user indicates certain retrieved documents relevant information reweight alter set query terms process called relevance feedback 
focus baseline statistical dr strategy tuning representation current user request anticipating user requests document descriptions 
strategy major benefits 
allows late binding 
complex concepts need anticipated indexing control user query time 
second redundancy supported drawing indexing terms document text limited vocabulary may support particular user needs 
representation derived documents differences similarities document texts best chance survive document representations 
consider example query statistical dr system cheap method prefabricated housing 
term weights shown assigned automatically highlighted stems statistics occurrence set documents 
document matching query stems cheap score highly 
user indicated system document relevant relevance feedback increase weights cheap 
addition highly weighted terms relevant document say unit construct added request weights

research results showing effectiveness statistical dr methods solid tests done different environments instance subject domain ranges system parameters say weighting alternative evaluation procedures example distinct performance measures 
methods generally apply document routing standing needs coarser document categories

current state dr thousands bibliographic databases accessible mainly surrogate form variety services 
longstanding debate merits controlled vs natural language indexing important commercial databases
