type button behavior non standard avoided studies 
recommending joystick recommend trackball easiest session study amount target reentry 
argue result joystick quickest shows speed extension ip fitts model necessarily equal ease comes young children 
furthermore add efficiency may goal adults user interfaces may case year olds play important appear goal oriented tasks 
relevance fitts law spite concerns believe fitts law useful tool design children graphical user interfaces 
provide helpful guidelines sizing positioning visual targets modeling time children take click 
guidelines ensure children frustrating experiences trying click visual targets small 
researchers put forth reasons fitts law 
reason comes selecting input devices children speed necessarily equal ease 
appropriate input device selected speed correlate ease 
joystick proved quick difficult task average takes longer difficult child task average takes lesser amount time 
children efficiency goal decide want click icon sense ensure perform operation appropriately quick easy manner 
expressed skepticism fitts law influence design graphical user interfaces fact simple fitts law study may yield information needed predict complex interactions point drag menus 
contend complex interactions require high level analysis user targets making fitts law metrics cumbersome 
studies conducted including fitts law dragging tasks steering law tasks menus similar tasks necessary interactions common young children software 
matter fact set software tries avoid complex interactions software designed young children 
designers simple interactions young children software complex interactions difficult children due children developing abilities 
simple interactions provide match type tasks fitts law model 
particular simple point click interfaces quite common software designed young children examples 
mentioned earlier joiner contended fitts law applied children capable expert performance 
fact reviewed fitts law successfully applied children contention credible 
fitts law verified people disabilities cerebral parkinson disease people underwater monkeys difficult believe applied children 
crook argue fitts law study suggests young children manage complete tasks similar necessary software designed adults 
fact complete tasks mean find tasks easy 
matter fact evidence reviewed clearly shows children difficulty input devices younger years 
experiencing difficult tasks create frustration turn children turn away potentially enriching educational creative software 
believe children deserve software designed unique abilities 
software difficult children users 
implications interface design way help children software easy size visual targets appropriately 
literature reviewed learned young children performance fitts law tasks older children adults 
means order young children quick access visual target adult visual target closer cursor reducing amplitude equation wider increasing width equation 
applications difficult constrain control cursor extension distance visual target 
option designers control size visual target 
downside increasing size visual targets occupy valuable screen space children authoring accessing options pursuing activities 
problematic children cognitive abilities needed decipher complexity graphical user interfaces improve age 
way reduce complexity reduce number actions available user 
means year old may able interface actions available icons interface may complex year old visually process effective manner 
young children effectively lesser number icons ones need larger icons 
alternative point click interfaces large icons proposed 
proposal hop options user interface 
technique children assured valid option having cursor icon pointing clicking 
technique may application may appropriate mouse input devices worth considering especially users young years old 
challenge children motor skills pose designers change children age 
interface designed account motor skills year olds 
extra reason cognitive limitations mentioned design interfaces fit children called ages interfaces 
number different age groups design depend application hand 
evidence summarized points children making greater improvements abilities early years model predicts 
means designers pay greater attention needs age specialized interfaces target audience younger 
example differences year old children prompt need different interfaces differences eleven twelve year old children 
need different interfaces mean separate applications built age group 
option design lowest common denominator 
mean making size visual targets complexity interface appropriate youngest children software designed 
approach easy implement limit availability options screen space older children 
spite limitation may appropriate solution simple applications extra functionality available older children 
option design software configured visual targets different sizes 
windows example allows users set icons larger twice width 
options difficult implement may better accommodate users 
combined providing functionality advanced users smaller visual targets 
way interface adapt users motor cognitive abilities 
younger experienced users start software fewer options larger visual targets move accessing options smaller visual targets 
example interfaces older children involve interactions require reading typing spelling skills younger children pointing clicking small number appropriately sized icons meaningful visual designs 
tune shneiderman recommendation providing novices small number actions simpler interfaces 
similar outcome achieved allowing users take different paths application 
paths designed fit different age groups 
children path designed age group free easily explore paths interfaces designed age groups 
example application children retrieve contents digital library different interfaces accessed navigating zoomable environment 
recommendations meant graphical user interface design lessons learned reviewed literature apply tangible user interfaces 
particular designers tangible user interfaces intended children involve pressing physical buttons pointing physical items physical items take account children developing motor skills 
studies need conducted gain better understanding evolution children performance input devices 
particular interest evolution follows exponential curve proposed 
studies comparing children performance eighteen year old adults help obtaining useful guidelines children visual target sizing needs 
similar studies need conducted learn amount screen options complexity children manage different ages 
guidelines studies combined information input device performance provide powerful building blocks construction age appropriate user interfaces 
provided solid empirical backing claim young children motor skills affect graphical user interfaces 
lower performance young children fitts law tasks means user interfaces designed include larger visual targets 
designers particularly certain designs appropriate youngest children intend support consider designing alternative interfaces different age groups 
larger visual targets young children software secret brings evidence supporting designs 
hope experienced designers appreciate reviewed data confirming knew 
little experience hope information save time designs
