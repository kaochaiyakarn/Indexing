setup experiment consist system user identical information small display large display 
users asked perform variety tasks whichever display feel help complete task efficiently 
observing choice displays physical movements displays able infer preference data working various tasks 
subsequent studies compare performance various tasks displays 
hypothesis user interaction exists possibly non linear function describes viewing distance preferences relate size displays 
done media communications research viewing distance preferences relate size displays current studies included user interaction 
understand subjective preference viewing distance relates physical size displays users interact content 
understanding allow formulate viewing distance recommendations design systems comprise multiple large displays 
experiment entail having users move comfortable position interacting displays various sizes 
content include text images movies users perform various actions 
additionally test presence sound affects preference viewing distance 
hypothesis users find large displays engaging motivated perform tasks 
anecdotal evidence suggests users working large displays engaged tasks hand spend time effort working 
users motivated certain tasks tend productive 
danger observations mainly users new working large displays engaged novel 
quantifying effect difficult entail field study observe users working traditional displays large displays extended period time 
chapter lessons system interface designers eventually build complex environments comprise different types displays 
display garden prototype environment questions answered successfully leverage advantages offered type display combine coherent manner form unified display environment 
displays get larger start filling larger portion environment important consider physical architecture facilitate construction computer systems workplaces 
final chapter combine experience findings results researchers formulate design principles building multiple display systems include large displays

worked pragmatics multiple display systems include large displays 
successful completion thesis contingent finding areas furthering field terms theoretical understanding physically large displays terms build effective systems 
expect research contribute fundamental understanding physical size perception interaction information especially relates subjective preference cognitive social benefits 
new paradigms metrics quantifying benefits large displays

evaluating risks exist potential risks hinder timely completion thesis 
largest risk significantly interesting effects associated varying physical size displays 
personally working display garden environment year anecdotal evidence suggesting qualitative differences standard desktop monitors physically large displays 
quantified differences continue design controlled studies help understand effects physical size perception action information
