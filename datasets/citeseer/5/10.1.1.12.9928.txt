process described viewed abstractly follows 
identify words target english corpus corresponding translations source french corpus 

group words target language forming target sets translated orthographic form source corpus 

target sets consider possible sense tags word select sense tags informed semantic similarity words group 

project sense tags target side source side parallel corpus 
step process assumes sentence segment aligned parallel corpus suitable data available languages organizations ldc web promising source data new language pairs new genres nie resnik 
identifying tokenizing sentences obtain word level alignments parallel corpus giza method little dependence language evaluation section report english spanish

french word instance collect word instance aligned 
positions word instances recorded stages project eventual semantic annotation example alignment accident tragedy accident une catastrophe associate instances catastrophe tragedy 
second step collect word type set english word types aligned corpus call target set example target set french catastrophe contain english word types disaster tragedy situation arising translator chose render la catastrophe english awful situation 
extracting correspondences take advantage wordnet identify english nominal compounds order help reduce number ambiguous terms target set 
example nominal compound identification english side target set french contain bee ambiguous spelling bee vs insect 
compound identification target set contains bee rich unambiguous terms bee honey bee queen bee 
semantic similarity computation presence monosemous words provides strong reinforcement insect sense bee 
enables tag instances bee specific compound noun senses appear compound known sense inventory 
third step target set treated problem monolingual sense disambiguation respect target language sense inventory 
consider target set tragedy human reader juxtaposition words single set automatically brings certain senses small set compound matching rules considering window tokens right left satellite annotations senseval data part preprocessing

target set fe algorithm considers pair words identifies senses words similar semantically 
senses reinforced amount corresponding degree similarity 
comparison pairs word sense word ends having associated confidence reflects reinforcement sense received words set 
example kind drama sense tragedy received little support senses words set hand sense reinforced receive higher confidence 
third step highlight significance variability translation method relies semantic similarities multiple items target set target set contain members 
parallel corpus translator chose translate french word catastrophe tragedy target set catastrophe contain single element 
algorithm basis assigning reinforcement differently different senses result instances tragedy ones corresponding catastrophe tagged 
point take advantage bookkeeping information recorded earlier 
know instances tragedy associated target set tragedy instances labeled confident sense matter confidence distribution possible senses determined noun group disambiguation algorithm 
fourth final step take advantage english side tagging alignment project sense tags wordnet sense inventory adopt information theoretic measure semantic similarity taxonomy
