layout model combines strong points interbook rich user interface flexibility customization style typical aha architecture 
model allows adaptive courseware developer adapt user interface course nature need mentioned javascript hack 
provide high level flexibility layout model designed level interface model concepts views layouts 
brief views considered atomic interface elements 
views grouped 
form layout 
concepts detail 
views views pieces information course domain 
usually represent relevant information active concept concept user viewing moment 
view represent static information course domain 
views pre fabricated building blocks construct user interface specific course 
internally views simply java classes generate html pages frames underlying aha 
data structures 
concept user system uses set predefined views 
predefined views customized author course develop interface meets needs course 
author defines customizes view xml description language view name type title toolbox background bmp params link toc toc img bmp link glossary glossary img bmp view moment implemented number relatively simple basic views 
configuration views consists setting background picture title changing page margin view readable 
possible implement complex views offer tuning possibilities author 
considering parameters influence content view page shape 
view usually displays information active concept including links relevant concepts 
view contain links views offer information user active concept 
links result displaying new set views 
views directly represent different aspects concept called primary views 
views supplementary information called secondary views appear secondary 
views visible triggered link primary views 
author course usually choose important views primary views important views secondary views

example trigger secondary table content glossary 
layouts said views building blocks constructing concept representation 
views grouped 
html terms corresponds independent window view corresponds page shown separate browser window html frame window 
set forms concept layout entire presentation concept 
practically means different aspects concept synchronized windows
