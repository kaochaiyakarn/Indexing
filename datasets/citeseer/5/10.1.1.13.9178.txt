choice security inclusion internet businesses opted inclusion 
example protocol notoriously vulnerable snooping internet users justifiably afraid send sensitive information credit card numbers unencrypted connections 
fear essentially online retailers encrypted https connections processing orders 
large internet retailers amazon com successful example willing process orders unencrypted connections opened users obsolete misconfigured browsers prevent https 
presumably cost losing sale greater hypothetical cost exposing user credit card number 
cost fraud borne directly retailer card issuers lose money ways pressure retailers require encrypted connections 
contrast security technologies alter relationships participants system adopted easily

combined lower cost higher risk security server accepts unencrypted telnet connections risks theft passwords compromise machine

preceding discussion attempt account separate undocumented decisions millions system administrators necessarily somewhat speculative

measuring ectiveness particular security technologies start baseline assumption users taken account costs benefits personally derive sophisticated users technologies personally cost ective 
remains question predicting security externalities costs users single user decision adopt particular technology

systemic notions security established cryptography security research focuses providing worst case guarantees typically stylized model network viewpoint single component network 
beautiful results produced zero knowledge proof systems secure multiparty function evaluation usefulness solving real world network security problems demonstrated 
believe security computer networks best viewed system level component level better provide quantitative measures security respect realistic model user behavior absolute guarantees security respect stylized model behavior 
useful security metrics allow comparison cost deploy security measures benefit system wide security improvements 
systemic global view security important number reasons 
networks contain redundancy robust failures individual nodes 
october distributed denial service attack thirteen root dns servers internet forced servers ine lew 
attack dns system noticeable ect performance internet redundancy dns data stored locally remaining operational root servers 
internet designed robust distributed network measure security internet account layers redundancy design 
second internet protocols adaptive route network elements denial service attack massive creative ort response serious security security patches new anti virus software installed quickly massive numbers compromised machines 
properties evidence slammer worm attack microsoft sql server sla 
third computer networks may secure weakest components fact master attacker exploit vulnerabilities large number slaves distributed denial service attacks 
economics provides natural framework define metrics systemic security 
consider network network identical additional security technologies adopted possibly subnetwork 
economic point view natural measure value additional security terms expected increase total utility users network 
extreme secure additional ort adopters security technology produced economic value 
extreme may remain insecure total utility system negligible additional security economic value
