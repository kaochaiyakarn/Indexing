trust model trust parameters peertrust peer trustworthiness defined evaluation peer terms reputation providing services peers past 
reputation reflects degree trust peers community peer past experiences 
identify important factors evaluation feedback terms amount satisfaction peer obtains transactions peers number transactions peer performed peers scope factor comparing feedback different peers credibility peers submit feedback addressing risk potentially false feedback rate peers reputation transaction context factor addressing impact transaction characteristics transaction size type trustworthiness peers community context factor addressing impact community specific properties trustworthiness peers 
general trust metric define general trust metric combines parameters coherent manner 
denote total number transactions peer period denote normalized amount satisfaction peer receives peer ith transaction denote peer peer ith transaction cr denote credibility feedback submitted denote transaction context peer ith transaction cf denote community context peer period 
trust value peer denoted defined cr cf metric consists parts 
part weighted average amount satisfaction peer receives transaction weighted credibility feedback source transaction context 
evaluation seen prediction peer likelihood successful transaction 
confidence value computed associated trust metric may reflect number transactions standard deviation ratings depending different communities

general trust metric may different appearances depending parameters turned parameters weight factors set

basic metric basic metric computes trust value peer basic parameters average credible amount satisfaction peer receives transaction performed period 
feedback number transactions quantitative measures collected automatically 
third trust parameter credibility feedback qualitative measure needs computed past behavior peers file feedback 
different approaches determine credibility factor compute credible amount satisfaction 
example may function trust value peer credibility factor feedback trustworthy peers considered credible weighted untrustworthy peers 
believe study determines precision credibility feedback interesting hard research problem deserves attention 
adapting metric context factors metric may take account transaction context factor capture transaction dependent characteristics 
example community business savvy size transaction important context incorporated trust metric weight feedback transaction 
act defense subtle malicious attacks seller develops reputation honest small transactions tries profit dishonest large transactions 
various community contexts taken account address common problems 
example historical transaction history built metric community context factor lower weight transaction history add temporal adaptivity 
problem lack incentives rate free riding problem file sharing communities addressed building incentives awards rating sharing files community context factor 
trust authority pre trusted peers available community evaluation built metric community context factor metric robust manipulation malicious peers 

experimental evaluation built simulator performed initial experiments evaluate peertrust approach terms feasibility effectiveness benefits 
findings experiments summarized follows 
peertrust performs better approach transaction skew increases malicious behavior peers submitting false feedback increases community 
verifies importance number transactions credibility factor trust metric 
peertrust achieves desired temporal adaptivity historical transaction histories built metric community context factor 
community peers peertrust select peers highest trust value potential peers perform transactions higher transaction success rate community trust schemes peers select peers randomly potential peers perform transactions
