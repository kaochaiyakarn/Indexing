dynawall dynawall interactive electronic wall representing touch sensitive vertical information display interaction device wide high 
availability sufficient display space enables teams display interact large information structures collaboratively new ways 
persons individually parallel share entire display space

horizontal workspace realized touch sensitive plasma display pdp integrated tabletop 
people pens fingers gesture interaction information objects 
create annotate information objects shuffled rotated order accommodate different view orientations cause problems working horizontal interaction areas 
combines mobility comfort functionality pen computer 
independent power supply connected roomware components wireless network 
beach software provides private workspace personal notes public workspace allows moving roomware components example dynawall

modular version new functionality 
mobile networked context aware information appliance provides affordances pen individual cooperative 
order dynamically enlarge interaction area purpose shared vice versa flexible coupling displays realized overcomes restrictions display sizes borders 
displays dynamically form homogenous display area moved close 
appropriate triggering signal comes built sensors allowing users temporally combine individual workspaces larger shared simple physical movement space 
additional login needed 
connected allow users parallel ad hoc created shared workspace exchanging information simply shuffling display 
correct view perspectives facilitated way 
passage passage mechanism provides intuitive way physical transportation virtual information structures arbitrary physical objects called passengers 
assignment done simple gesture moving information object retrieval virtual part called bridge activated placing passenger object physical part bridge 
electronic tagging needed 
passengers viewed physical bookmarks connected virtual world 
software innovative functionality roomware components results combination hardware features software features enabling new types interactions cooperation 
cooperative hypermedia environment beach provides new forms intuitive human computer interaction fingers pens new ways cooperative sharing multiple device interaction 
provides modeless user interface allowing gesture commands having switch modes 
incremental gesture recognition detects type input provides feedback different colors sounds 
dynawall composed separate displays people cooperatively beach physical borders disappear providing seamless shared workspace 
magnets special application beach providing creativity tool information objects represented cards magnetic sense repelling attracting order structure networks ideas 
supports mobile road providing card creativity tool personal digital assistants pdas
