outlining range linguistic analysis levels amenable machine learning approaches describe general types machine learning algorithms apply language learning systems look systems deal challenging problems discourse analysis levels linguistic analysis tokenisation tokenisation process breaking sequence characters text locating word boundaries points word ends begins palmer 
seen serious problem researchers working english similar languages word boundaries generally coincident space characters challenging task chinese languages chinese word may single character series characters may spaces separate words 
tokenisation started creating maintaining hand built algorithms processed small texts single language 
explosion availability large unrestricted corpora forced move developing corpus machine learning algorithms robust depend formedness texts processed 
common approach tokenisation chinese start considering character distinct word variation maximum matching algorithm called greedy algorithm 
part speech tagging pos tagging word assigned correct part speech noun verb adjective adverb furthermore pos taggers give additional grammatical features singular plural number tense gender 
number tags different systems varies lot 
systems fewer tags 
systems part speech tagging learnt statistical models training corpus 
early example constituent likelihood automatic word tagging system leech atwell learnt constituent likelihood model tagged brown corpus cl basically tag bigram model augmented longer grams special case idioms 
stochastic taggers achieve results accuracy 
stochastic taggers require tables lexical pos ngram statistics explicitly represent intuitive rules 
implementing improvements tagger difficult number sophisticated variants original cl pos bigram model tried major improvements accuracy 
popular alternative machine learning approach pos tagging transformation learning brill learn local tag combination constraint rules eliminate candidate tags incompatible immediate context select tag required specific context 
brill tagger retrained range tagged corpora produce range pos taggers see atwell 
parsing task automatic parser take formal grammar sentence apply grammar sentence produce parse tree structure sentence 
parsing established nlp task 
contrasting starting points reflect contrasting perspectives starts words sentence builds tree bottom starts node builds tree top 
bottom parsing approached variation tagging adding higher level tags top 
example atwell atwell represents parse tree sequence labelled brackets higher level tag bundle closing opening brackets pos tags new sentence pos tagged pos tags predict 
top parser machine hand parsed corpus extracting subtrees constituent immediate daughters converting context free rule 
example atwell learned prolog definite clause grammar parser parsed samples lob corpus 
improvements computer speed memory allowed machine learning larger patterns parsed corpus example dop data oriented parser bod learns possible substructures parsed corpus parses new sentence finding optimal combination subtrees span sentence 
semantic analysis semantic annotation augmentation data facilitate automatic recognition underlying semantic content structure 
common practice respect labelling documents thesaurus classes sake document classification management 
universal agreement semantic features ought annotated atwell fact past annotation motivated linguistic theories instance social interaction 
semantic annotation connection machine learning software trainable annotated corpora word sense disambiguation resolution summarization information extraction measuring semantic similarity difference documents tasks 
discourse analysis part speech tagging parsing semantic analysis take place level word sentence sentence text analysed independently 
language real spoken dialogues exhibits structure sentence boundaries 
conversation meanings refer back previous sentences series turns speakers generally structure meet goals participants 
semantic categories universal agreement discourse analysis categories labels growing range dialogue transcript corpora dialogue act speech act tags designed specific applications

machine learning techniques linguistic annotation corpora gram markov models markov model sequence states symbols words part tags estimate probability likelihood sequence

semantic networks typically nodes represent concepts connections represent semantically meaningful associations concepts 
better characterized associative network models neural brain models 
activation rules implement information retrieval associative networks referred spreading activation typically produces intersection search 
called spreading activation models reggia lin 
transformation learning brill developed symbolic machine learning method called transformation learning tbl 
tagged training corpus transformation learning produces sequence rules serves model training data 
derive appropriate tags rule may applied order instance untagged corpus 
tbl relies heavily large annotated training corpus relies reasonable default heuristics get things started 
learns rules easily understandable allows rules easily acquired different domains genres

gap initial semantic network generated input data semantic representing profound knowledge knowledge database constructed 
transformation rules semantic analysis method pattern matching semantic network 
transformation rule description language allows users manipulate knowledge base define rules 
decision tree classification decision tree constructed recursively partitioning training set selecting step feature reduce uncertainty class partition split 
example cohen decision tree learner ripper induce decision tree automatically label new corpus predicates fold cross validation ensure results stable 
vector clustering approach uses occurrence statistics construct vectors represent word classes meanings virtue direction multi dimensional word collocation space 
example atwell annotated word sample lob corpus vector neighbouring word types words similar vectors clustered word classes 
method calculating semantic word vectors random labelling words narrow context windows calculate semantic context vectors word type text data 
incorporating linguistic information context vectors enhance results
