secure aodv aodv scheme assumes node certified public keys network nodes intermediate nodes validate transit routing packets 
basic idea originator control message appends rsa signature riv element hash chain lam result consecutive hash calculations random number 
message traverses network intermediate nodes cryptographically validate alternative implementation packet carrying purse fictitious currency nodes remove reward faces different challenges 
signature hash value generate th element hash chain number traversed hops place packet 
route replies provided destination intermediate nodes having active route sought destination mode operation enabled different type control packets 
public key cryptography imposes high processing overhead intermediate nodes considered unrealistic wide range network instances 
furthermore possible intermediate nodes corrupt route discovery pretending destination immediate neighbor advertising arbitrarily high sequence numbers altering decreasing arbitrarily increasing actual route length 
additional vulnerabilities stem fact ip portion aodv traffic trivially compromised due aodv operation protected additional hop hop cryptography accumulation signatures 
assumption certificates bound ip addresses unrealistic roaming nodes joining manet sub domains assigned ip addresses dynamically dhcp dro randomly zero configuration hat 
different approach taken secure message transmission smt pap protocol topology view network determines set diverse paths connecting source destination nodes 
introduces limited transmission redundancy paths message pieces successful reception pieces allows reconstruction original message destination 
piece equipped cryptographic header provides integrity replay protection origin authentication transmitted paths 
reception number pieces destination generates informing source pieces routes intact 
order enhance robustness feedback mechanism small sized acknowledgments maximally dispersed successful reception piece sufficient protected protocol header 
pieces received source re transmits remaining pieces intact routes 
pieces acknowledged messages remain outstanding protocol adapts operation determining different path set re encoding undelivered messages re allocating pieces path set 
proceeds subsequent message transmissions 
protocol exploits manet features topological redundancy widely accepted techniques source routing relies security association source destination highly efficient symmetric key cryptography 
impose processing overhead intermediate nodes nodes routing decisions feedback provided destination underlying topology discovery route maintenance protocols 
fault tolerance smt enhanced adaptation parameters number paths dispersion factor ratio required pieces total number pieces 
smt yield successful message reception percent network nodes malicious 
algorithms selection path sets different properties different metrics network feedback implemented smt 
smt provides flexible endto secure traffic engineering scheme tailored manet characteristics 
noteworthy smt provides limited protection compromised topological information main focus safeguard data forwarding operation 
multiple routes compensates partially incorrect routing information rendering compromised route equivalent route failure 
disruption route discovery effective way adversaries consistently compromise communication pairs nodes 
approach secure route discovery procedures secure routing protocol srp proposed pap 
scheme guarantees node initiating route discovery able identify discard replies providing false topological information avoid receiving 
novelty scheme compared manet secure routing schemes false route replies result malicious node behavior discarded partially benign nodes transit querying node deemed invalid reception 
security goals achieved existence security association pair nodes need intermediate nodes cryptographically validate control traffic 
widely accepted technique manet context route discovery broadcasting query packets basis protocol 
specifically query packets traverse network relaying intermediate nodes append identifier ip address query packet header 
queries arrive sought destination replies contain accumulated routes returned querying node source may routes forward data

particular dynamic source routing dsr joh haa zone routing protocol zrp haa framework protocols extended natural way incorporate srp :10.1.1.129.426
furthermore protocols abr toh example combined srp minimal modifications achieve security goals srp protocol 
srp nodes securely associated need cryptographic validation control traffic intermediate nodes factors render scheme efficient scalable 
srp places overhead nodes appropriate choice highly decentralized environment contributes robustness flexibility scheme 
srp rely state stored intermediate nodes immune malicious acts directed nodes wish communicate secure manner 
srp provides route replies correctness verified route geometry
