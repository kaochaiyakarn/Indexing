halo supporting spatial cognition small screens users pan zoom display content disappear screen space particularly small screen devices 
clipping locations relevant places map spatial cognition tasks harder 
halo visualization technique supports spatial cognition showing users location screen objects 
halo accomplishes surrounding screen objects rings just large reach border region display window 
portion ring visible screen users infer location object center ring 
user study participants completed types map route planning tasks faster halo arrow visualization technique 
keywords halo visualization peripheral awareness screen locations hand held devices spatial cognition maps 
people maps number tasks including finding nearest relevant location gas station hand optimizing route 
map users easily compare alternative locations selection restaurants shown indicated symbols 
users see far away restaurant user current location lies close locations user considers visiting 
users required zoomed view example follow driving directions relevant locations disappear screen space making comparison task difficult comparing alternatives requires users zoom repeatedly timeconsuming process hardly accomplished onthe fly 
especially small screen devices car navigation systems personal navigation devices severely limit user capability respect spatial cognition tasks 
halo halo addresses issue virtually extending screen space visualization locations objects 
shows map navigation system enhanced halo 
shows detail map addition display contains location information contained 
encoded overlaying display window translucent arcs indicating location restaurants located screen 
shows patrick baudisch microsoft research microsoft way redmond wa usa works 
arc part circular ring surrounds screen locations 
arc small fragment ring curvature contains information required inferring ring center screen object located 
display window shown contains restaurant display informs users periphery located southwest closest 
problem order route decisions users need see alternatives drilling street information relevant locations disappear screen space 
shows ring sizes governed 
map restaurant moves screen 
restaurant icon reaches border region display window ring grows icon 
restaurant moves screen ring radii recomputed dynamically ring just big reach border region display window occluding display central region 
halo combines advantages visualization techniques display large documents small screens 
overview detail visualizations offers single view allows users inspect detail information losing context 
fisheye views halo displays distorted reported carried author affiliation xerox parc parc see concept desert fog zoomable interfaces 
especially important map related tasks 
techniques arrows point screen locations city lights halo provides full information location screen objects direction 
enhancing map halo shows screen space restaurants located 
works location located center ring reaches display window 
location display window ring emerges center 
ring grows location away 
halo implements metaphor metaphor halo represent screen locations cast light ground map 
metaphor allowed derive important properties halo 
creates aura large artifact allows observers infer lamp existence view 
second aura created map round allowing users conclude center location small part ring visible 
third light overlays objects occluding overlapping multiple lamps aggregate nicely adding light intensities 
fourth fading aura distance provides additional visual cue distance 
intense aura indicates lamp located nearby weaker aura indicates distant lamp 
prototype implemented metaphor literally light dark background 
final design undergone modifications 
order easier perceive halo curvature replaced smooth transition aura edges sharp edge 
second minimize occlusion window content overlap replaced disks rings 
third inverted color scheme resulting dark halos light background order better accommodate typical map material light background 
concept fading arcs representing distant locations implemented rendering short arcs represent nearby locations nearly opaque longer arcs representing distant location increasing 
user study conducted user study comparing halo visualization technique arrows point screen locations 
participants completed tasks locating screen locations picking closest screen location arranging screen locations shortest possible traversal avoiding traffic jams 
subjects achieved significantly better task completion times tasks halo interface faster 
tasks majority subjects expressed preference halo interface 
halo visualization technique providing users location awareness objects 
halo provides single non distorted view document overlaid location information screen locations 
arrow visualizations halo require explicit distance annotation distance information encoded arcs directly incorporates scale scene 
plan explore application halo area real time tasks simulations highly interactive games halo arcs continuously update users location moving objects user periphery
