algorithmic aspects web information retrieval goal general purpose search engines index sizeable portion web independently topic domain 
engine consists major components crawler called spider robot collects documents recursively fetching links set starting pages 
crawler di erent policies respect links followed deeply various sites explored pages indexed various search engines di er considerably 
www google com indexer processes pages collected crawler 
decides index 
example discard duplicate documents 
builds various data structures representing pages 
search engines build variant inverted index data structure see 
details representation di er major search engines 
example di erent policies respect words indexed capitalization stemming locations documents stored indexer build additional data structures repository store original pages web graph representation store hyperlinks related pages nder store related pages result query capabilities features result pages various engines vary considerably 
query processor processes user queries returns matching answers order determined ranking algorithm 
transforms input standard format lower case terms uses index nd matching documents orders ranks 
algorithmic issues arise part 
discuss 
crawler crawler needs decide pages crawl 
possible implementation assign page priority score indicating crawling importance 
maintain pages priority queue ordered priority score 
priority score pagerank score de ned section page goal maximize quality pages index 
alternatively score criterion goal maximize freshness pages index 
crawler consider various load balancing issues 
overload servers crawls limited bandwidth internal processing capabilities 
interesting research topic design crawling strategy maximizes quality freshness respects load balancing issues 
indexer indexer builds data structures needed query time 
include inverted index url database potentially graph representation document repository related pages nder data structures 
inverted index contains word list documents containing word potentially position word document 
list sorted lexicographically document id position document pair 
see detailed description data structure 
save space documents represented document ids index data structures 
results displayed document ids need converted back url 
done url database 
graph representation keeps document documents pointing documents points 
see potential implementation 
document repository stores document id original document 
related pages nder stores document id document ids pages related document 
related page page addresses topic original page necessarily semantically identical 
example www com newspapers news organizations web related pages 
see algorithms nd related pages 
course data structures combined 
building data structures indexer needs determine pages index 
assign numerical score page index certain number top ranked pages 
example score set duplicate pages 
score try measure query independent quality page 
example done pagerank measure see 
interesting algorithmic question data structures compress space possible ecting average lookup time 
furthermore data structure remain space ecient insertions deletions documents allowed 
query processor main challenge query processor rank documents matching query decreasing value user 
purpose numerical score assigned document documents output decreasing order score 
score usually combination query independent query dependent criteria 
query independent criterion judges document regardless actual query 
typical examples length vocabulary publication data site belongs date change various connectivity techniques number hyperlinks pointing page pagerank score 
query dependent criterion score determined respect particular query 
typical examples cosine measure similarity vector space model query dependent techniques statistics answers previous users selected query :10.1.1.120.3875
algorithmically interesting techniques query independent query dependent connectivity techniques 
describe approach 
assumption connectivity ranking techniques link page page means author page recommends page course assumption hold 
example hyperlink considered recommendation page author hyperlink generated example web authoring tool 
idea studying referrals new 
sub eld classical information retrieval called bibliometrics citations analyzed 
see 
eld developed algorithms similar connectivity ranking techniques described :10.1.1.109.4049:10.1.1.109.4049
furthermore large amount web related research exploits hyperlink structure web 
graph representation web web represented graph di erent ways 
connectivity ranking techniques usually assume straightforward representation graph contains node page exists directed edge page contains hyperlink page query independent connectivity ranking assumption connectivity techniques immediately leads simple query independent criterion larger number hyperlinks pointing page better page 
main drawback approach link equally important 
distinguish quality page pointed number low quality pages quality page gets pointed number high quality pages 
obviously easy page appear high quality just create pages point 
remedy problem brin page invented pagerank measure :10.1.1.109.4049
pagerank page computed weighting hyperlink proportionally quality page containing hyperlink 
determine quality referring page pagerank recursively 
leads de nition pagerank page 
exists outdegree dampening factor usually set number pages web outdegree number hyperlinks page alternatively pagerank de ned stationary distribution nite random walk node graph node equally node determine node biased coin probability node chosen uniformly random nodes graph probability chosen uniformly random nodes edge exists graph 
pagerank measure works distinguishing high quality web pages low quality web pages google search engine www google com re ned pagerank criterion sped computation see 
pagerank random walks performed sample web page pagerank distribution uniformly distribution respectively 
goal compute various statistics web pages compare quality respectively number pages indices various commercial search engines
