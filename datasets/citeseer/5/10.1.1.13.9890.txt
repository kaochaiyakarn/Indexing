local consensus ontologies discussed section agent searching particular web service ontology web services may match ontologies agents listing web services

assume ontologies merged similar domains restrictions words terms 
approach allows find semantic syntactic similarity comparing ontologies time global common ontology merges ontologies local consensus ontology 
approach agent maintains perspective concepts relationships exist agents ontologies 
explain create ontology 
describe search syntactic semantic similarities add new relations learn new concepts 
xml ontology creation aims local ontology consensus process easy non knowledge engineer

xml ontology creation gui relationships ontologies

contains 
equivalent ontologies stored represented xml 
xml ontologies platform dependent extensible related formats daml 
internally concepts relationships listed list nodes 
node name represents concept 
node contains information relationships node nodes ontology 
structure conceptually visualized tree structure operations performed accordingly 
explain determine similarity identification 
similarity identification similarity identification involves detection concepts similar concepts understood agent 
agents look identify concepts syntactically semantically similar equivalent 
look determine syntactic equivalence semantic equivalence 
syntactic equivalence syntactic equivalence identification occurs agent attempts find concepts syntactically similar understands 
example want able determine concepts airplane airplanes syntactically equivalent 
edit distance measure syntactic equivalence 
edit distance established method weighting difference strings 
uses minimum number token insertions deletions substitutions required transform string dynamic programming algorithm 
example edit distance ed lexical entries engine equals ed engine 
delete operation changes string engine 
levenshtein edit distance method calculate syntactic similarity measure strings formula min si sj ed si sj ssm si max min strings concept names compared syntactic similarity ed edit distance 
ssm returns degree similarity 
ssm measure suggest identical match strings similarity zero indicates bad match 
method considers number changes change string weighs number changes length shortest string 
previous example compute ssm engine 
semantic equivalence checking syntactic equivalence phase similarity identification determine semantic equivalence agent concept agent concept 
lexical database wordnet 
synsets provided lexical database get meaning word various contexts 
depending context choose proper synset compare 
semantic matching required designers ontologies different words express concept 
case simple string comparisons syntactic comparisons lead identification equivalence concepts 
example consider organization called concept jet vehicle parent children 
organization named concept airplane craft parent way syntactically determining airplane jet craft vehicle semantically equivalent lexical database wordnet 
concept relation discovery integration new concept relation discovery agent determines agent concept similar equivalent concept syntactically semantically add concept associated relations local consensus ontology 
associated new equivalent concept relations attached concept 
new relations added target local consensus ontology relations refer semantic relation discovery 
example agent concepts vehicle car engine relations car vehicle car engine 
agent may concept auto semantically equivalent car 
new concept agent may relation auto wheels 
agent incorporates new relation local consensus ontology say agent discovered new concept auto relation auto wheels 
step described subsection learning integrating new relation local consensus ontology 
semantic relation integration possible scenarios semantic relation integration 
newly discovered concept equivalent local ontology concept equivalent 
look case semantically equivalent concept discovered agent ontologies 
agent discovered new concept relations attempts integrate new relations local consensus ontology possible 
refer process semantic relation learning 
form learning new concepts machine learning sense 
previous example agent discovered new concept auto concept relation auto wheels 
auto semantically equivalent car lexical database determine car wheels car wheels 
successfully incorporates new relation say agent successfully integrated learned new semantic relation 
second scenario semantic relation integration agent semantically equivalent concept agent case need search new concept agent semantically integrated agent local consensus ontology 
concept agent ontology may semantically equivalent agent concept may related agent concept 
discovery relationship happen human intervention lexical database 
approach forming local consensus ontologies autonomous merging lexical database wordnet search relationships concepts 
previous example suppose agent concept benz agent trying integrate ontology auto concept 
case agent uses lexical database attempt integrate new concept benz 
agent discovers relation benz engine agent lexical database agent learn relation benz car 
wordnet provides ability find types relationships including hypernyms hyponyms meronyms 
hypernym identifies concepts super class current concept 
example computer hypernym supercomputer 
inverse relation hyponym 
hyponym relation identifies concepts sub class current concept 
hyponym relation thought relationship 
approach uses holonym relation provided wordnet 
holonym relation identifies particular concept part relation 
example computer holonym memory 
inverse relation meronym 
meronym identifies concepts part word part relation
