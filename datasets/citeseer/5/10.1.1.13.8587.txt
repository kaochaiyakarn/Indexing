integrating information bootstrap information extraction web sites fabio ciravegna david guthrie yorick wilks department computer science university sheffield regent court portobello street dp sheffield uk propose methodology learn extract domain specific information large repositories web minimum user intervention 
learning seeded integrating information structured sources databases digital libraries 
retrieved information bootstrap learning simple information extraction methodologies turn produce annotation train complex engines 
corpora training engines produced automatically integrating information different sources available corpora services databases digital libraries 
user intervention limited providing initial url adding information missed different modules computation finished 
information added delete user reused providing training getting information recall precision 
currently applying methodology mining web sites computer science departments 
enabling large scale information extraction web limited user intervention relevant issue internet especially semantic web perspective 
semantic web idea semantically document annotation performed order allow better document retrieval empower semantically aware agents 
current technology human centered annotation completely manual 
manual annotation difficult time consuming expensive 
convincing users annotate documents web ontologies difficult requires world wide action uncertain outcome 
static annotation associated document incomplete incorrect creator skilled obsolete aligned pages updates irrelevant users page pet shop web site annotated shop related annotations users prefer find annotation related animals 
producing methodologies automatic annotation pages important 
initial annotation associated document loses importance time possible automatically document 
information extraction text able produce automatic annotation porting new application domains fairly unconstrained domains web reach current technology 
association domain specific ontology limits domain application feasible 
example currently reduce annotation burden annotation tools 
technology supervised learning require user defined annotated corpora 
task complex documents cope high variability type free texts mixed rigidly structured pages amount annotated material grows supervised learning unfeasible 
propose methodology learn extract information texts integrating information different sources 
information extracted starting highly reliable easy mine sources databases digital libraries 
extracted information bootstrap complex modules wrappers collect information turn train sophisticated engines 
corpora training engines produced automatically integrating information different sources available corpora services databases digital libraries 
natural application methodology web large companies information systems option 
focus web particular mining web sites 
step train system bootstrapping learning 
case supervised learners annotated corpus needed 
key feature web exploit enable bootstrapping redundancy information 
redundancy presence multiple citations information different contexts different superficial formats 
redundancy currently improving question answering systems 
known information different sources possible multiple occurrences bootstrap recognisers generalised retrieve pieces information producing turn generic recognisers 
information different formats web documents repositories databases digital libraries agents able integrate different information sources output possible extract information different reliability 
systems databases generally contain structured data queried api 
case api available database web front output textual wrappers induced extract information 
wrapper induction methodologies able model rigidly structured web pages produced databases 
information contained textual documents extracting information requires sophisticated methodologies 
wrapper induction systems extended cope rigidly structured pages free texts mixture 
obvious increasing degree complexity extraction task mentioned 
task difficult reliable generally extracted information example wrapper induction systems generally reach rigidly structured documents systems reach free texts 
complexity increases amount data needed training grows wrappers trained handful examples full systems require millions words 
model learning complex modules bootstrapped information coming simple reliable sources information 
information annotate documents train complex modules 
redundancy web generally allows 
example simple wrapper extract information web page produced database containing papers computer science department ciir cs umass edu publications index html 
page annotated induce wrapper 
possibilities manually annotating results database order train wrapper user intervention needed dozen databases coped necessary manually annotate examples look known database contains examples site annotate produced pages 
example case computer science department possible citeseer www citeseer com 
citeseer large database papers computer science 
largely incomplete place scientists look 
wrapping citeseer possible extract number examples hopefully relevant databases 
example querying citeseer ciir bibliography names umass cs department pages containing papers lists produced 
citeseer known format information extracted 
simple information integration techniques possible automatically annotate information ciir page title generally necessary just intelligent string matching 
examples possible induce wrappers high regularity information ciir page able extract papers ciir 
considering training wrapper generally requires just handful examples possible focus examples match clear reliable discarding examples questionable producing highly reliable wrapper 
just example idea 
task complex information needed training reliable input data difficult identify 
idea mine web sites computer science departments

rare cases personal lists papers produced departmental database publication pages formatted way cases person writes list personal format style quite irregular list compiled manually different moments times 
typical case wrapper approach requires manually annotating examples page member staff 
irregularities style produce noisy data classic wrappers able cope noise 
order bootstrap learning query digital libraries citeseer keywords staff names discovered 
output name hopefully list papers 
lists incomplete digital libraries largely incomplete 
titles list query search engine retrieve pages containing multiple citations 
focus lists tables papers 
titles tend unique identifier 
looking seed examples discard titles report hits avoid titles common strings lost 
discovering new names seed examples annotated adaptive system develop page specific patterns 
favour examples contained xml structures lists tables multiple evidence
