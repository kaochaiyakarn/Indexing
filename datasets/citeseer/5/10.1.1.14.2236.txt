starve sharing problem modeled prisoner dilemma 
classical prisoner dilemma cpd players choose simultaneously operate 
rewarded cooperate lower rate penalty received cooperates 
dilemma rational choice cooperating leaves worse operated 
assumptions underlying cpd apply environment

assumption players act simultaneously needs relaxed 
third incentives contribute cooperate may depend users contributing number needs incorporated theoretical model

strategy motivates users increase rating order gain access files 
user ratings different metrics number files advertised user number file requests served user
