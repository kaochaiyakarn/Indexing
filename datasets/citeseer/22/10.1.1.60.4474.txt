multistrategy learning peculiarity inthelex integration multistrategy operators may help solution theory revision problem pre processing incoming information theoretical framework integrating different learning strategies known inferential learning theory

conversely abduction aims completing possibly partial information examples adding details abstraction removes superfluous details description examples theory 
opposite perspectives aim reducing computational effort required learn correct theory respect incoming examples 
inthelex requires observations expressed terms set predicates description language learning problem

differently abstraction see specific information saturation left example description 
preserved learning process evidence reveals significant concept definition cautious behaviour 
abduction defined peirce hypothesizing facts theory explain observation 
framework proposed abductive logic theory normal logic program set abducibles set integrity constraints 
abducibles predicates assumptions carry incompleteness domain possible complete predicates theory correctly described 
integrity constraints corresponding combination literals allowed occur provide indirect information 
proof procedure implemented inthelex corresponds intuitively standard logic programming derivation suitably extended order consider abducibles 
abstraction pervasive activity human perception reasoning 
interested role plays machine learning inductive inference taken account 
exploitation abstraction concerns shift language theory described higher level 
incremental induction classification rules cultural heritage documents framework proposed concept representation deals entities belonging different levels 
concrete objects reside world observer access mediated perception 
available time stimuli memorized organized structure extensional representation perceived world 
reason perceived world communicate agents language needed describes intensionally 
abstraction takes place world perception level means set operators propagates higher levels possible identify operators corresponding previous ones 
abstraction theory expresses operators allow system replace number components compound object decrease granularity set values ignore objects just part features neglect number occurrences kind object
