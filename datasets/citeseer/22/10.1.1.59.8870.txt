approaches result static integration easily scale accommodate new catalogs 
specific issue integrating large number dynamic catalogs considered 
area peer peer systems attracted researchers past years 
breed systems gnutella napster systems alike focused sharing files music video clips 
systems support limited set metadata offer limited querying functionality keyword search ir style content matching 
limitation may acceptable simple file sharing www simulation fr seq purposes need structured querying exploit inherent semantics data :10.1.1.11.6811
