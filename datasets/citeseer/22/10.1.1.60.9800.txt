web huge source information possible find publications scientific literature 
majority papers usually irrelevant individual researchers 
conventional search engines users need specific tools methods effective available scientific resources 
example special search engines scholar articles gained lot popularity professionals specialists 
online libraries citeseer acm digital library computer science researchers search download papers relevant scientific area 
services provide search browsing facilities list papers 
novice researcher hard determine papers really significant available 
nice beginner receive suggestions directly experts field 
expert knows papers influential papers published top conferences prestigious journals state art 
expert takes account lot implicit factors determines relevant 
unfortunately assign personal expert area interests novice researcher 
calls systems able facilitate scientific publication search 
proposed solutions scientific publication search personalization systems focus need certain user maintaining profile notifying periodically demand papers related user interests 
main goal systems filter information flow delivering user items related interests 
differently recommendation systems usually exploit knowledge obtained different users system generate useful recommendations 
recommendation systems collaborative filtering algorithms compare similarity users order recommend target user previously unseen items contained profiles similar users 
extent currently developed systems mitigate search relevant literature person novice field 
shortcomings

pro active recommendations turn heavy flow potentially interesting items 
systems require explicit feedback convenient discouraged users 
multi agent system scientific publications search
