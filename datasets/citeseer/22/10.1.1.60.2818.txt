summary discussion peer peer file sharing systems organize users overlay network facilitate exchange data 
systems democratic nature means central authority mandate coordinate resource peer contributes 
voluntary participation distributed resources highly variable unpredictable 
research shows users simply consumers contribute system 
users free riders gnutella users share 
users sessions relative short sessions shorter hour 
short session means large portion data system unavailable large period time 
growing number free riders result systems lose sprite peer peer traditional client server system various forms abuse attack observed practice 
peer peer system reliable platform distributed resource sharing provide predictable level service 
order peer contribution possible economic methods incentives monetary payment pays consume resources paid contribute resource 
differential service peers contributes get better quality service 
monetary payment needs imaginary currency requires accounting infrastructure track various resource transaction charges micro payments

precisely strategic game consists set peers players peer player set actions called strategies peer player utility function gives peer utility list peers actions 
list actions player game called action profile strategy profile

finding nash equilibria best response functions game player infinitely possible actions possible find nash equilibrium examining action profiles turn 
develop alternative method finding nash equilibria reformulate definition nash equilibrium player game 
call action player maximizes utility player action player best response 
similarly call action player maximizes utility player action player best response 
definition best responses pair actions nash equilibrium player action best response player action player action best response player action
