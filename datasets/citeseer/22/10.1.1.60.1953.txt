ip multicast network layer multicast mechanism sending data source multicast group members 
sending separate copy data group member source sends single copy members 
underlying multicast routing protocol determines respect certain optimization objective multicast tree connecting group members 
data generated source flow multicast tree traversing tree edge exactly replicated branching node 
group members join leave multicast group multicast tree dynamically reconfigured 
conceptually simple elegant ip multicast widely adopted years invention 
due concerns related deployment need router support multicast violation argument system design scalability need maintain group state information router network management need support higher layer functionality security error control 
application layer multicast alm proposed alternative multicast 
major difference ip multicast alm packets replicated routers packets replicated hosts 
specifically alm members multicast group communicate overlay network edge corresponds direct unicast path group members 
data packets sent unicast packets forwarded member overlay network 
result alm require additional router support multicast support additional functions maintenance group state information core edge routers 
enables rapid seamless deployment multicast applications 
price alm pay performance penalty terms packet delay bandwidth usage resilience change overlay network packet may replicated forwarded link hosts may join leave multicast group dynamically routers 
due ease deployment alm protocols proposed :10.1.1.12.7544:10.1.1.16.8178:10.1.1.19.7440
