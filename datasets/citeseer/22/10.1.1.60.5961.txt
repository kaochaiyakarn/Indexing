social filtering methods nowadays popular recommendation systems example recommending suitable learning material chen lee 
idea recommend new items user similar users preferences 
typically similar users determined comparing user profiles 
initial profile may constructed explicit query may learnt user previous selections 
user profiles compared ways example computing mean square difference pearson correlation profiles 
notice partially clustering users defining nearest neighbours 
similar method hubs authorities algorithm hits kleinberg searching relevant internet pages 
hits pages assigned hub authority values pages authorities refer referring pages hubs referred 
hub values updated authority values authority values hub values system converges best authorities selected
