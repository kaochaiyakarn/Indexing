definition secure protocol particular instantiation authentication protocol referred run 
presenting definition secure protocol consider properties consider successful run 
successful run communicating parties alice bob exchange number messages assurances identities furthermore optionally share secret key known 
completed run party accepts rejects identity optionally secret key 
successful run run completed parties accept 
property successful run alice bob accept identities 
authentication involves key exchange accept exchanged key 
second property successful run concerns records protocol run assuming participants recorded exchange 
proceed require definitions regarding word match applied records run slightly different definition bird bird 
matching messages say message record matches message record lists message incoming record lists message outgoing fields message relevant authentication records 
qualification relevant authentication necessary allow individual messages match bit wise identical 
motivation message contains unsigned fields cryptographically irrelevant authentication discrepancies fields preclude message meeting definition matching 
matching records runs say records run match messages partitioned sets matching messages set containing message record messages originated participant appear order records messages originated participant appear order records 
simplicity consider protocols messages need arrive order sent 
note messages originated distinct participants order respect 
allows case messages transit cross 
case participant record message having sent crossing message received 
property successful run alice bob recorded exchange records run match 
distinguish successful run secure run 
consider run successful reasonable definition run considered secure intuitive sense 
hand possible run unsuccessful absence security breaches legitimate parties reject reason 
possible enemy may delay legitimate message run indefinitely 
suppose particular run alice accepts bob identity sends message protocol bob enemy destroys message 
assuming bob receive message accepting alice identity bob accept alice identity 
intuitively run unsuccessful security breaches time alice accepted bob identity sent message bob record partial run matched alice record 
purposes denial service attack considered security breach problems dealt physical security techniques 
position define means run symmetric asymmetric mutual authentication protocol insecure definition particular run protocol insecure run party involved run say alice executes protocol faithfully accepts identity party conditions holds time alice accepts party identity sends receives subsequent message party record partial full run match alice record 
exchanged key accepted alice known party identity alice accepted 
condition apply authentication key exchange 
note definition conventional key exchange protocol requiring trusted third party kohl secure 
clear alice record match party definition actual record point time received information carry computations required reach accept state messages sent received subsequent irrelevant 
goal enemy cause run insecure 
goal designer protocol enemy task impossible computationally infeasible instances 
reversing definition get definition secure symmetric asymmetric mutual authentication protocol definition secure protocol protocol conditions hold cases party say alice executes protocol faithfully accepts identity party time alice accepts party identity sends receives subsequent message party record partial full run matches alice record 
computationally infeasible exchanged key accepted alice recovered alice possibly party identity alice accepted 
condition apply authentication key exchange 
definitions particularly helpful deciding protocol secure lead constructive procedures verify expose weaknesses protocol 
definitions applied directly deciding potential attack real attack 
example authentication key exchange suppose enemy merely intercepts alice bob messages passes unchanged 
intuitively enemy compromised system case parties accepted identities matching records run exclusively share secret key 
note definition run insecure 
cases supposed attack may quite convoluted may obvious attack amounts just passing messages 
definition distinguish pass non attack 
section definition serves identifying real attacks particular second condition appears trivial essential 
formal analysis techniques successfully uncover weaknesses authentication protocols see section proof correctness difficult depends heavily proper modeling goals assumptions

timestamps timestamps convenient administrative documentation purposes desirable practice avoid relying security authentication protocols 
difficulties precautions objections timestamps documented literature bell bird 
convenience summarize notable issues 
timestamps authentication parties maintain local clocks periodically synchronized secure manner reliable source time 
synchronizations reliable time source local clocks may drift 
parties alice bob allow time window timestamps compensate local clock drift fact messages take time cross network 
alice accept timestamp bob window time alice local clock long bob particular time value 
alice store time values parties current window impractical communications environments store latest time party insist strictly increasing time values party 
strictly increasing time values case bob uses time far reason severe clock drift improper synchronization reliable time source bob able communicate alice time window 
prevent problem alice store time update record latest time value bob 
potentially lead choice storing large quantities data sacrificing communications availability sacrificing security 
concerning communications availability parties local clocks far synchronization parties communicate 
tends concerned communications availability want wide time windows increases storage requirements 
timestamps convenient theoretical point view number practical problems 
protocols random numbers suffer difficulties 
formal analysis verification authentication protocols burr 
starting list initial formal beliefs objective logically derive stated protocol goal consuming list protocol steps 
basic assumptions analysis typically parties involved ability check freshness timestamps 
fact main results identification security requirement time clocks trustworthy certain protocols 
means practice security timestamp protocols relies heavily proper implementation synchronized secure time clocks 
unfortunately despite discussion literature regarding timestamp protocols den habe comes implementing protocol significance security time clocks easily lost furthermore costs associated proper implementation significant
