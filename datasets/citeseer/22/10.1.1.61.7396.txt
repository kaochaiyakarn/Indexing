weblogs key tool individuals publish posts obtaining useful information daily basis 
providing tools publishing easy blog sites information publishing significantly efficient 
number articles posted day sites indicates popularity 
example large blog sites google weblog publish tens millions posts day 
weblogs obviously identify trends important events subjects carefully analyzed posts 
tracking topics descriptions period time serve describe changes trends
