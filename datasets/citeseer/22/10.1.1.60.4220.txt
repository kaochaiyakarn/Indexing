basic notions formal concept analysis duality extension intension basic notions fca described section mathematical details ganter wille 
central notion fca duality called galois connection 
duality observed types items relate application objects attributes documents terms 
galois connection implies sets type larger correspond smaller sets type vice versa 
example considering documents garfield snoopy socks bobby cartoon real dog cat mammal formal context famous animals terms information retrieval enlarging set terms reduce set documents contain terms smaller set terms match larger set documents 
formal concept analysis elements type called formal objects elements type called formal attributes 
adjective formal emphasize formal notions 
formal objects need objects kind common sense meaning object 
object attribute indicative applications may useful choose object items formal objects choose features characteristics formal attributes 
information retrieval application documents considered object terms considered attribute 
examples sets formal objects formal attributes tokens types values data types data driven facts theories words meanings 
sets formal objects formal attributes relation form formal context represented cross table see 
elements left side formal objects elements top formal attributes relation represented crosses 
example formal objects animals famous certain parts world cartoon characters garfield snoopy bill clinton cat socks bobby dog lived scotland featured british children stories dedication deceased owner claimed planet oldest animal brought england darwin living australia zoo 
attributes describe animals cartoon characters real animals dogs cats mammals 
course toy example sufficient explain basic features fca 
interesting feature galois connections certain closure relation implied 
starting set formal objects identify formal attributes common 
example common attribute bobby real 
real animals socks real 
starts bobby derives shared attributes real derives animals real obtains object set bobby socks attribute set real 
point relation closed cartoon cat dog garfield snoopy mammal real socks bobby concept lattice formal context enlarge attribute object set 
starts bobby socks obtains mammal real objects attributes formal objects formal attributes 
pair set formal objects set formal attributes closed manner called formal concept 
bobby socks real form formal concept bobby socks mammal real form different formal concept 
set formal objects formal concept called extension set formal attributes intension 
formal context formal concepts extensions intensions uniquely defined fixed 
concept lattices important advantage fca galois connections sets formal concepts visualized 
shows called line diagram concept lattice corresponding formal context 
concept lattice consists set concepts formal context relation concepts cf 
ganter wille mathematical details 
nodes represent formal concepts 
formal objects noted slightly formal attributes slightly nodes label 
continuing example previous section node right side labeled formal attribute real shall referred concept retrieve extension formal concept needs trace paths lead node collect formal objects 
example formal objects concept socks bobby 
retrieve intension formal concept needs trace paths lead extension bobby socks extension bobby socks concept concept intension real intension real mammal subconcept superconcept relation order collect formal attributes 
example node concept node formal attributes attached 
concept represents formal concept extension bobby socks intension single element set real 
formal concept mentioned section extension socks bobby intension real mammal 
concept connected concept edge line going concept left labeled object attribute line diagram 
concept shall referred concept summarizes relationship concept concept concept subconcept concept extension concept subset extension concept intension concept superset intension concept edges line diagram concept lattice represent subconcept superconcept relation 
top bottom concepts concept lattice special 
top concept formal objects extension 
intension empty need empty 
example top concept formal attribute animal 
bottom concept formal attributes intension 
formal attributes mutually exclude dog cat extension bottom concept empty formal object dog cat time 
top concept thought representing universal concept bottom concept null contradictory concept formal context 
subconcept superconcept relation transitive means concept subconcept concept reached traveling upwards 
formal concept formal attribute attributes inherited subconcepts 
corresponds notion inheritance class libraries object oriented modeling 
reason fca suitable modeling analyzing object oriented class libraries described example godin mili leblanc 
japan yew scotland pine pine interval scale world oldest trees conceptual scaling single concept lattice large sets objects attributes fairly large complex 
visualizations concept lattices interest messy comprehensible human user 
information messy visualization provides underlying lattice complex 
lindig snelting advantage case showing concept lattice dependencies different pieces software code extremely messy provide argument attempting re engineer code 
concept lattices information displayed different format 
example applications carpineto romano engine concept lattices mainly internal structures displayed user 
parts lattices displayed similar file folder displays second level hierarchy indented expanded collapsed interactively users 
applications fish eye displays described carpineto romano 
different approach reducing complexity concept lattices idea dividing lattices different components groupings related formal attributes similar notion facets library science 
groups separately visualized lattices 
groups possible predict structure formal attributes considering formal objects 
example structure data derived survey represents rank orders agree strongly agree neutral disagree disagree strongly 
lattice rank order drawn considering actual results survey 
ganter wille call lattices conceptual scales 
drawing conceptual scale formal objects taxa yew yew scotland pine pine conifer swamp japan pine nominal scale world oldest trees mapped positions scale 
manner single scale re different formal contexts 
survey example scale different surveys compare results 
ganter wille typical conceptual scales nominal scales cf 
ordinal scales interval scales cf 

names scales adopted traditional statistics 
addition facilitating re conceptual scales utilized analyzing dependencies attributes ganter wille 
interval scale shown suitable formal attributes range possible values 
example formal objects trees claimed world oldest trees sites www 
formal attributes describe claimed ages 
example sites claim tree year old claim years old 
tree assigned formal attributes 
age range north american smaller 
usually claimed years old 
larger tree assigned formal attributes precise values 
formal object interval scale precise range values shows second scale set formal objects 
case formal attributes botanical classifications trees 
trees belongs different botanical family 
mentioned kind scale really just partition data separate classes called nominal scale 
scales applied set objects combined called nested line diagrams ganter wille 
nested line diagram shows scales figures combined somewhat simplified manner 
interval scale inner scale nominal scale outer scale 
purpose toscana software facilitate interactive exploration nested line diagrams 
toscana user select taxa yew yew scotland pine pine conifer japan swamp nested line diagram combining figures pine scales prepared combine 
user choose order scales combined outer inner scales 
possible zoom scales choose different parameters display formal objects 
initial set toscana system new application quite labor intensive usually formal attributes depicted standard scales 
qualitative data new scales may need designed application 
toscana software applications far including large scale applications required manual design scales 
examples toscana system civil engineering building codes north ministry mentioned toscana system library catalog rock wille 
toscana systems represent possible manner combining scales 
different approach suggested faceted information retrieval fair system priss scales nested side side 
relationship scales explored selecting elements scale cause corresponding elements scales highlighted 
implications scope discuss fca techniques described applications 
important area mentioned implications 
example shows dependencies formal attributes 
example formal attribute mam mal attached node nodes dog cat 
means formal attributes dog cat imply formal attribute mammal 
course biological truth 
attribute implications example may hold example general cartoon implies mammal implies real 
implications involve combinations attributes 
cat dog imply formal attributes contradictory paths cat dog meet bottom node 
implications studied ganter wille 
step wise computer guided construction conceptual knowledge called attribute exploration ganter wille 
support attribute exploration example provided software burmeister program mentioned 
starting preliminary formal context software prompts user series questions relationship attributes 
example software ask cartoon animals mammals
