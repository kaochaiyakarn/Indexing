brief literature review prior efforts develop context aware applications 
early context awareness includes active badge system developed olivetti research lab redirect phone calls people locations 
parctab system developed xerox palo alto research center early nineties relied pdas support variety context aware office applications locating nearby resources printers posting electronic notes room 
relevant applications emerged years range location aware tour guides hips os context aware memory aids 
research efforts context awareness include mit oxygen cmu aura projects berkeley hl name just 
early context aware applications relied ad hoc architectures representations quickly recognized separating process acquiring contextual information actual context aware applications key facilitating application development maintenance 
georgia tech context toolkit represents significant effort direction da 
context toolkit widgets act wrappers provide access different sets contextual information user location identity time activity insulating applications context acquisition concerns 
user relevant entities physical objects locations context server contains widgets relevant 
similar notion wallet serves directory personal resources relevant user relevant location tracking functionality relevant collections preferences access calendar systems 
semantic wallet goes step dey context toolkit 
possible leverage richer models personal resources personal information give access access go accessing resources 
addition includes access control obfuscation functionality enforce user privacy preferences 
richer model demonstrated semantic web environment enhancing everyday campus life open collection context aware applications scv gs 
notion semantic extends current technologies providing unified privacy front resources available user 
extends languages appel xacml allowing definition policies refer open collection ontologies allowing context sensitive policies including obfuscation policies 

system architecture museum guide architecture user interacts open collection applications pda receives entering museum 
step user asked questions aimed identifying interests relevant preferences including privacy preferences

applications available user include pull push applications 
example pull application recommendation service suggest additional exhibits user interests exhibits seen current location time available 
examples include service provide users directions go particular exhibit people finder locate visitors rating application enables visitors share ratings comments exhibits 
examples push applications include public announcement messages shop closing times movie start times museum closing times possibly ads promotions telling visitor book exhibit visiting available museum store
