activity models knowledge workers knowledge justified true belief personal belief justified information 
knowledge created individuals social interactions 
organisational knowledge management crucially important knowledge society consists amplifying knowledge individual 
individuals continuously personally committed knowledge creation 
personal commitment relies intentions autonomy individuals 
intention defines understanding actions individual autonomy gives self motivation freedom absorb create knowledge 
personal autonomy crucial knowledge creation tools focus support personal autonomy 
study nature knowledge workers kidd distinguishes types office workers knowledge worker creating new knowledge communication worker amplifying information connecting people clerical worker managing documents 
workers perform administrative tasks repetitive structured document driven research tasks flexible unstructured information driven different proportions 
research tasks usually structured procedures workers clear idea step 
knowledge workers produce new information combining existing body knowledge 
ideas formed minds individuals developed social interactions 
process linear continuous interplay capturing organising formalising retrieving knowledge 
due differences working styles impossible find scenario correctly describes knowledge workers activities 
unstructured creative nature document management difficult role documents unclear 
knowledge workers spatial layout desk temporary holding pattern contextual clue interruptions doing 
unstructured hard support electronic tools knowledge workers high personal autonomy need freedom creative 
opinion focus knowledge workers realise workers mixed characteristics repetitive administrative creative unstructured 
mixture activities unstructured nature workers find little support existing tools 
semantic desktop aims radical change harder support knowledge workers 
mental model categorising people bad categorisation categorise information librarian context 
ability retrieve information depends clues people remember associatively 
stimulate associations retrieval clues relate context categorised information 
mental model categorisation unknown surely strict hierarchy fluid flexible 
hand classifications computers folder structures strict hierarchies leading usability problems classification problems underpin usability issues 
searching sorting workaround issues categorisation classification systems relatively opaque users 
opacity attributed rigidity classification schema 
categorising information especially difficult knowledge workers unstructured nature activities categorisation presumes structure exist 
categorising strongly related document intended unknown knowledge worker 
people greatly prefer category search keyword search strict hierarchies categorisation worsens results strict hierarchies people :10.1.1.8.9649
restricting search interfaces predefined categories detrimental better flexibly learn categories available data 
bowker star define ideal classification complete consistent segmentations mutually exclusive categories 
state investigated real world classification system meets requirements categories exclusive especially disagreement ambiguity systems complete practical political financial reasons ad hoc categories created people ignore misunderstand classification mix contradictory classification principles 
reality categorisations rigid hierarchical exclusive flexible ambivalent overlapping 
categorisation cognitively difficult categorisation schemes unstable subjective 
results lead document file systems metadata properties folder hierarchies retrieval 
hand desk organisation physical digital desks serves storing retrieving documents reminding tasks 
barreau nardi observe people location search directory browsing logical search file metadata 
furthermore observe people files placements reminders placing files location noticed 
reminding function file placement possible logical semantic file system explicit locations folders 
opinion advocated depart predefined structures restrict people confined categorisations structures 
semantic desktop users encouraged enrich documents metadata leading improved search removing need explicit locations folders 
careful restrict tions metadata conform single hierarchy back original problem 
interlinked nature information semantic web data typically highly interconnected heterogeneous fixed schema large extent case semantic desktop data 
technique navigating datasets scalable support graph navigation 
generic dependent fixed schema allow exploration dataset prior knowledge structure 
bush noted getting record largely caused indexing 
keyword search suffices simple information lookup higher search activities learning investigating 
exploratory interface hand allows users find information prior knowledge schema visually slicing dicing available information interesting discovered 
users prefer find information searching jumping orienteering browsing related items 
people prefer exploration discover information unfamiliar domain investigating personal information space 
find difficult unambiguously specify looking human memory greatly benefit context information enabled exploratory browsing related items 
karger jones put users benefit able document authors photograph person representation location photograph taken map location 
especially users exactly formulate information need exploration technique necessary helps users discover data 
people passive finding information greatly benefit automatic presentation related information allowing explore interesting information 
opinion interlinked nature information crucial importance people exploited great extent 
visions bush depend common factors linking annotations 
annotations lead metadata allow precise searches links equally important enable exploratory navigation 
context activities known context important information recall 
ranganathan element information classified recalled remembered facets physical personal temporal spatial 
people categorise information context recalling benefits greatly contextual information 
personal classification system classification document strongly affected intended context means capture document context facilitate retrieval 
dumais report rich contextual information people names dates personal temporal dimensions provide beneficial cues retrieval personal information system important standard ranking functions 
bondarenko janssen show document management strongly related task management 
grouping placing documents desktop people perform task management reorder priorities moving documents desk spatial appearance desk represents stage task connecting task management physical desktop layout helps people easily continue interrupted tasks looking desktop reminded important tasks directly see stage spatial visual layout 
results indicate email increasingly task management 
explained close resemblance email physical desktop email provides overview communication overview pending tasks context conversations subsequent tasks kept documents tasks classification documents emails undecided roles optional 
opinion documents strongly related task management crucial keep tasks context including communication governs information relevant 
physical documents advent computers everyday life disappear 
web increased amount printing 
increases access information ii printing easier faster better iii extremely suited authoring reading reviewing documents 
adler reading occurs conjunction writing reading stimulates writing example annotating opinion 
furthermore reading writing activities subjects computers contained essential reading data 
corresponds earlier findings suited reading possibilities easy annotation quick navigation documents spatial layout form mental picture document 
sellen harper explain digital technologies shift point replacing 
digital technology enables replaces traditional technologies understanding way people currently digital domains allowed find basic needs personal document management 
kidd knowledge workers write things storing easily replaced computers writing important done 
knowledge workers contain valuable information documents read write write act writing thoughts 
physical marks document notes margin text diagram drawn desktop piles papers little notes crucial adequately captured represented digitally 
sellen harper say developers new technologies need accept recognise importance related activities organisational processes turn attention systems replace integrate electronic world opinion attention importance significant advantages digital technologies 
example st udel combine traditional pen digital technology allowing people annotate printed papers stylus pen automatically translating annotations digital document 
tendency ambitious kidd field study knowledge workers warns tools understand information processed knowledge worker give meaning document 
concentrate capturing reproducing physical marks notes arrows drawings 
dream providing electronic encyclopedia sky satisfies cases predict need know 
adoption new technology personal information management low users express great needs better solutions 
low adoption explained users features existing tools people unaware automatic email filtering diverse nature people needs 
example notwithstanding desktop search engines retrieve desktop information simple keywords people want categorise data folders browse occasionally 
people folders retrieve information replaced searching remind tasks decompose problems plan replaced search 
know people tools different way expect people understand power tools 
lower ambitions tools simple accessible advanced complicated including absolute ban technical computer science terms user interface 
apple spotlight google desktop beagle initiatives aim comprehensive memex semantic desktop 
denying technical challenges semantic desktop results literature indicate severe non technical challenges ahead 
explains problems personal information management recall recognition categorisation psychological issues 
discussed challenges grouped categories summarise follows focus individual give individual users incentive benefit focusing social network forget rigid classifications leave users freedom constrain rigid schemas constraint semantics follow links exploit interlinked nature rely search allow people associate freely remember context understand notion context capture information enhance recall understanding value power find ways computer prepare non exclusive usage people easily give keep simple focus simply capturing representing things user wants store doing reasoning
