system architecture bingo 
focused crawling toolkit consists main components depicted 

bingo 
architecture main components crawler 
crawler processes links url queue multiple threads 
retrieved document crawler initiates content specific handlers depend document mime type text html application pdf invokes classifier resulting feature vector 
crawled html document successfully classified bingo 
extracts href links adds url queue canonical form 
priority new links topic specific crawler queues set classification confidence parent document 
extracted terms links available crawler meta data url title classification results stored local database index retrieval 
document analyzer 
bingo 
computes feature vectors documents standard bag words model word elimination stemming tf log idf term weighting 
consider local document database approximation corpus idf computation recompute lazily corpus grows 
feature selection 
feature selection aims detect characteristic features training documents topic comparison opposing topics level topic tree 
features selected input vectors trainer classifier remaining features considered noise frequent competing topics manner word infrequent topics relevant typos 
mutual information mi measure build topic specific feature spaces 
technique specialized case notions cross entropy kullback leibler divergence known effective methods slightly favor rare terms ones high idf value excellent property classification 
classifier 
chose support vector machines svm model classification task vector space 
svm algorithm learning algorithm consists supervised training phase binary set topics 
optimization phase separating hyperplane computed maximizes margin set positive negative feature vectors dimensional feature space 
classification step simply computes algebraic sign scalar product hyperplane test document vector sign denotes side hyperplane test vector determined 
absolute value result yields measure classification confidence form perpendicular distance test vector separating hyperplane 
hierarchical multi class classification problem tree topics solved training number binary svm topic tree 
focused crawling web inherently involves precision recall trade 
principle focusing strategies provided regard user demand best possible precision recall strong soft focus 
strong focus pursues links documents successfully classified topic predecessors 
strategy useful keep crawler closely track improve crawler precision deep web search skipping potentially valuable hub pages belong topic interest contain links relevant page homepage overview dblp trier devoted topic database core technology contain links authors homepages working specific topic skipped 
contrast soft focus mode pursues links documents regard classification results provides higher recall 
case bingo 
additionally traverses links topic documents small threshold depth typically set depth topic specific document tunnel topic unspecific welcome table content pages reaching thematically relevant document 
topic distillation 
bingo 
engine applies kleinberg link analysis method coined hits iteratively topic taxonomy tree 
analogously google page rank hits algorithm uses documents adjacency matrix crawled web graph exploit principle eigenvectors 
page rank uses directly hits divides task approximation principle eigenvectors matrices aa respectively produces ranking best hubs link collections point multiple authorities best authorities high quality resources referenced hubs 
adaptive retraining 
building reasonably precise classifier small user specific training set challenging task 
address problem bingo 
introduces phase semi supervised training approach 
learning phase serves automatically identify characteristic documents topic coined archetypes bookmarks neighbor documents initial crawl strong focusing mode 
starting user training set archetypes determined neighbor documents highest classification confidence highest authority score promoted retraining extended classifier 
harvesting phase switches soft focus serves effectively process user information demands improved crawling recall
