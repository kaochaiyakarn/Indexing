timeline visualization overview visualization citewiz tool informally referred newton shoulders diagram visualization creates timeline articles authors central citewiz citation database displaying entity icon timeline publication date date publication case authors 
user task want support overview specifically tasks taxonomy 
surface area icon scaled proportionally amount citations article author received rounded icon conforms uniform grid 
timeline split suitable time units years months time segment gets assigned space timeline equal size largest entity segment 
icons representing entities time segment laid greedy algorithm places entities descending size allocated space timeline trying minimize distance centerpoint diagram

implementation allows user zoom pan continuously visualization 
furthermore orient timeline vertically human figures entity icons giving impression people standing shoulders 
exactly metaphor mind designing visualization matches intuition researcher named sir isaac newton famous quote letter robert hooke seen standing shoulders resting came 
diagram tells relative chronology researchers specific field instantly shows influential authors relationships 
diagrams modified show additional dimensions applying color entity icons 
choice metric display way chosen arbitrarily adhoc metric authors citation density define total number citations author divided total number publications written author kind average quality metric
