section describe method making inferences context implementations 
implementation semantic web trust requires users describe beliefs 
person file lists know trust social information automatically compiled processed 
base ontology friend friend foaf project allows users create statements know building web acquaintances 
foaf schema rdf vocabulary web user describe information name email address homepage information people knows 
line security mentioned users sign files information attributed known source explicitly anonymous source 
people identified foaf email addresses unique person 
project introduce schema designed extend foaf person allows users indicate level trust people know 
foaf base users identified email address 
trust schema adds properties domain foaf person 
new properties specifies level trust scale 
levels roughly correspond 
distrusts absolutely 
distrusts highly 
distrusts moderately 
distrusts slightly 
trusts neutrally 
trusts slightly 
trusts moderately 
trusts highly 
trusts absolutely trust general limited specific topic 
users specify trust levels person different subject areas 
users specify topic specific trust levels refine network 
example bob may trust dan highly regarding research topics distrust absolutely comes repairing cars 
trust ontology different trust ratings properties person class range person 
properties general trust encoded follows person rdf id joe mbox rdf resource mailto bob example com rdf resource sue person set properties defined trust specific area 
correspond values indicated trust regarding specific topic 
range topic specific properties class defined group person subject trust 
class properties indicates person trusted indicates subject trust 
range restrictions property leaves user specify subject ontology 
consider example shows syntax trusting person relative different topics person rdf id bob mbox rdf resource mailto joe example com rdf resource dan rdf resource example com ont research rdf resource dan rdf resource example com ont person topic specific information provided queries ask trust levels subject network trimmed include relevant edges 
large networks form users link foaf file foaf files 
example include trust file dan 
spidering links allow seeds produce large graph 
interesting projects emerged foaf networks including depiction project svg image annotation irc bot provides foaf data network 
having specified trust levels described network emerges useful interesting 
directed weighted graph generated edge indicates trust relationship weight edge reflects specified trust level 
computing trust direct edges individual nodes graph contain explicitly expressed trust value 
knowing user explicitly trusts graph infer trust user individuals directly connected 
basic calculations network 
maximum minimum capacity paths algorithms research trust follows standard rules network capacity path maximum amount trust source give sink limited larger smallest edge weight path 
maximum minimum capacity path functions identify trust capacity paths highest lowest capacity respectively 
useful identifying range trust neighbors maximum minimum length paths addition knowing varying weights paths useful know steps takes reach path length functions return full chains weighted edges maximum minimum length paths 
weighted average algorithm described value represents recommended trust level weighted average designed give calculated recommendation source trust sink 
average formula default trust metric applications querying network 
designed simple metric reasonable different users want different metrics metric maximum capacity path trust value path 
long path lengths 
users may want lower trust rating links away opposed direct neighbor 
issue deals trust distrust 
maximum capacity calculation assign external value trust ratings considered simply real values 
social relevance numbers variants single path trust value calculation may desirable 
example distrusts regarding specific subject turn distrusts subject possible want give relatively higher rating 
hold opposite views may mean close 
alternately may want distrust distrusts logic distrusts trust especially untrustworthy 
variants trust metric long list unrealistic provide different functions variant 
designed interface users create user metrics 
process described section 
default trust calculated simple function 
maximum capacity path sink simple recursive algorithm applied calculate average 
node direct edge sink ignore paths weight edge value 
node directly connected sink value determined weighted average values neighbors path sink 
calculated trust node node function neighbors paths calculating average formula ensures trust line trust intermediary 
current implementation metric searches entire graph simple modification easily limit number paths searched node 
social network follows small world pattern average distance network increases logarithmically number nodes

trust mail trust ratings consider case research groups working project 
professors head group know professor knows students group 
familiar students group 
part project student sends email group professor professor know message worth paying attention 
name unfamiliar message distinguishable important mail inbox 
scenario exactly type situation improves 
professors need rate students professor 
trust algorithms looks paths graph just direct edges path professor professor student 
student professor met exchanged correspondence student gets high rating intermediate relationship 
turns students sending junk type messages network producing high rating professor simply add direct rating sender downgrading trust level 
override direct ratings factored ratings professor intermediate step path 
ratings alongside messages useful value basically replicate way trust relationships awareness thereof social settings 
example today sensible polite student start unsolicited email indication relationships student professors advisor collaborated topic past suggested contact receiving note professor check colleague student claims correct just take claims face value extending trust attention student basis presumed relationship 
effort needed verify student phone email walking hall weighed possible harm student seriously tends extending trust blindly worthwhile 
lowers cost sharing trust judgments widely dispersed rarely interacting groups people context email 
gathering machine encoded assertions people trustworthiness reasoning assertions presenting augmented assertions user friendly way 
extending partial automation trust judgments contexts simple altering user interface appropriate earlier trust service internet relay chat bot 
expect situations demand different inference procedures service supports different networks relations 
current web difficult achieve sort link 
semantic web overlay different patterns trust relation set nodes simple altering predicate focus 
illustrates method creating trust network semantic web 
introducing ontology algorithm finding trust resulting network different methods accessing network web service applications step showing non security efforts part foundation web trust 
area progresses developers consider depth investigation algorithms calculating trust 
algorithm designed simple proof concept 
studies look algorithmic complexity graph size increases social issues path length considerations averages recommendations increasingly important
