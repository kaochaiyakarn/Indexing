years tremendous efforts provide multicast support ranging ip multicast proposed application layer multicast 
ip multicast utilizes tree delivery structure fast resource efficient scale support large multicast groups 
approximately decades inception ip multicast far widely deployed internet 
due technical reasons marketing reasons 
critical ones include lack scalable inter domain routing protocol state scalability issue large number groups lack support access control requirement global deployment multicast capable ip routers lack appropriate pricing models 
issues internet service providers isps reluctant deploy provide multicast service 
years researchers resort application layer multicast approach multicast related features implemented hosts :10.1.1.16.8178
data packets transmitted hosts unicast replicated hosts 
examples yoid system multicast almi nice name 
systems require infrastructure support intermediate nodes routers easily deployed 
application layer multicast generally scalable support large multicast groups due relatively low bandwidth efficiency heavy control overhead caused tree maintenance hosts 
addition point view isp approach hard effective service model profit group membership multicast trees solely managed hosts difficult isp efficient member access control obtain knowledge group bandwidth usage appropriate pricing model impractical impossible 
question viable practical solution large scale multicast support 
multicast service multiple parties involved network service providers higher tier isps internet service providers lower tier isps refer isps short users 
party really cares multicast 
users care long get service reasonable price 
network games implemented unicast 
network service providers care long sell connectivity service price 
contributes reason delay ip multicast deployment 
obviously isps middle ones really care multicast goal limited bandwidth purchased network service providers support users possible biggest profit 
develop practical comprehensive profitable multicast service model isps critical path multicast wide deployment 
strongly motivated propose tier overlay multicast architecture called toma provide scalable efficient practical multicast support variety group communication applications 
architecture advocate notion multicast service overlay network referred mson backbone service domain 
mson consists service nodes proxies strategically deployed mson provider isp 
design mson relies defined business relationships mson provider network service providers underlying network domains group coordinators initiators mson provider dimensions overlay network user requests provided long term measurement purchases bandwidth network service providers service level agreements slas sells multicast services group coordinators service contracts 
outside mson hosts group members subscribe mson transparently connecting special proxies called member proxies advertised mson provider 
communicating member proxy unicast host form cluster hosts close 
cluster application layer multicast efficient data delivery limited number users 
users participating groups need pay regular network connection service outside mson

proposed toma architecture provides scalable efficient multicast support practical pricing model isps brings advantages 
mson provider support variety group communication applications simultaneously existing multicast overlays overlay supporting group 
provides additional incentive isps adopt toma 
second relatively easy isps manage resources mson defined business relationships slas network service providers service contracts group coordinators 
put major efforts planning managing overlay networks 
third notion mson significantly simplifies management underlying networks network service providers need provide services limited numbers mson providers millions billions individual users 
level traffic aggregation long run intserv practical 
analogy scenario relationship manufacturers dealers consumers daily life 
lastly mson extended support virtual group services web content distribution 
web clients share similar interests form virtual group managed mson 
data transmission inside mson reorganized order provide better services 
toma reality face challenges efficient management mson anticipated mson accommodate large number multicast groups 
mson provider efficiently establish manage numerous multicast trees 
cluster formation outside mson users multicast groups disperse country world

appropriate member proxies selected 
efficient clusters formed users 
mson dimensioning mson provider overlay architecture dimension overlay network

pricing lack mechanisms measure resource usage bill multicast users main barriers delay deployment ip multicast 
charge multicast group users mson important factor decide mson practical solution 
tackle issues 
address efficient management mson propose efficient scalable protocol called overlay aggregated multicast protocol adopt aggregated multicast approach multiple groups sharing delivery tree 
outside mson develop efficient member proxy selection mechanisms choose core application layer multicast routing approach data transmission inside clusters

efficiency gain toma vs nice due reasons 
toma takes advantage carefully dimensioned overlay networks resemble underlying network topology nice relies path probing techniques constructs overlay topologies degraded quality
