want formulate precise specific queries order generate google query results high information density purposes 
choose instances queries simultaneously find instances classes instances relations

patterns identifying relations relation pk defined ck ck partial ontology identify explicit natural language formulations relation 
interested patterns pk form ck expression ck express relation pk natural language 
patterns meet criteria precision 
preferably phrase unambiguous probability terms belong intended class small 
example consider relation place birth person city
