consequently achieving appropriate balance relevance novelty achieving diversity preserving global coherence crucial extender 
preserving global coherence extender task topics globally coherent relate user initial concept map may provide rich information exploit context 
unfortunately search engines restrict queries small number terms term limit google single query reflect limited information 
consequently extender uses multi step approach focus topics collecting filtering terms multiple retrievals 
cycle extender maintains relationship candidate topic terms initial concept map ways term weight reinforcement 
terms collected extender retrievals associated weights summarizing terms goodness query terms 
terms may weighted highly topic descriptors topic discriminators 
term topic descriptor occurs documents similar initial concept map term topic discriminator occurs primarily similar documents similarity computed cosine similarity metric document concept map term vector representations 
reasons space define descriptors discriminators formally provide formalizations proposes evaluates methods dynamic extraction topic descriptors discriminators context concept maps 
start cycle extender calculates terms descriptive power directly topology user concept map described 
user selected focus concepts bias topic search weights terms selected concepts labels adjusted constant weighting factor greater 
subsequent iterations weights adjusted dynamic extraction procedures reinforce weights terms proven descriptors discriminators topic represented search context 
context filtering 
document terms considered candidates inclusion part new topic document survive selection process requires minimum similarity document search context 
novel terms descriptors discriminators topic reflected search context discarded 
query refinement 
query terms generated web search may provide definitive results 
initial search results help automatically refine subsequent queries 
terms occur documents high term wise similarity initial concept map may help achieve recall query 
hand terms tend occur similar documents useful achieving high precision 
extender computes similarity retrieved documents initial concept map adding terms occur primarily documents similar search context 
extender final stage system presents final set topics user terms highest descriptive value produce labels suggested topics 
generating cohesive topics local coherence reflects degree generated topic composed tightly related terms 
context cohesiveness measured ability topic prompt retrieval documents similar 
generating cohesive candidate topics extender uses short text excerpts text snippets provided google readily available search results represent documents 
need group collection short text excerpts highly related documents contrasts common clustering scenarios 
full access documents text available document clustering appears preferable term clustering give clustering algorithm greater discerning power identify topics 
observed documents represented small number terms case text excerpts collected extender collection analysis consists material shares common general theme consequence extender attempt preserve global coherence terms may informative documents identifying topics collection 
exceptions existing clustering algorithms apply single purpose clustering cluster documents terms separately 
extender applies medoid clustering algorithm cluster documents terms simultaneously 
document extender finds terms best characterize document topic 
subsequent step uses selected terms identify documents best specify topic terms 
process repeated consecutive iterations produce set terms documents result detected non consecutive iterations 
iteration sizes sets containing selected terms documents decrease remain selection process guaranteed terminate finite number iterations 
sets selected terms documents term medoids document medoids define set cohesive topics 
clustering algorithm tailored extender addresses goal achieving local coherence domain
