discuss avenues research currently progress related bgp policies section 
start giving overview bgp routing section 
bgp routing single internet consists thousands autonomous systems ases networks owned operated single institution 
bgp routing protocol exchange reachability information ases 
usually isp operates isps may operate multiple ases business reasons provide autonomy administrators isp backbones united states europe historical reasons merger isps 
non isp businesses enterprises may operate ases gain additional routing flexibility arises participating bgp protocol 
compared enterprise networks isps usually complex policies arising fact downstream customers connect certain customers multiple geographic locations complex traffic engineering goals run bgp internal routers just border routers enterprises 
observations apply enterprise networks core focus isp networks 
section describe bgp standpoint single describing protocol transmits routes decision process choose routes mechanisms routers implement policy 
exchanging routing state example topology isps shows simple bgp network 
bgp sessions established border routers reside edges border routers neighboring ases 
sessions exchange routes neighboring ases 
border routers distribute routes learned sessions internal routers border routers internal bgp ibgp 
addition routers usually run interior gateway protocol igp learn internal network topology compute paths router 
router combines bgp igp information construct forwarding table maps destination prefix outgoing links shortest paths network chosen border router 
bgp relatively simple protocol salient features 
bgp incremental protocol complete routing table exchanged neighbors changes information exchanged 
changes may new route advertisements route withdrawals changes route attributes 
second bgp path vector protocol advertisements contain list ases reach destination 
third routes advertised prefix level send separate update reachable prefixes 
fourth bgp update messages may contain fields including list prefixes advertised list prefixes withdrawn list route attributes describe various characteristics advertised route 
isp implements policies modifying route attributes changing way routers react advertisements certain route attributes discussed 
selecting route router bgp router isp may alternate routes reach particular destination 
absence policy router choose route minimum pathlength arbitrary way break ties routes pathlength 
order give operators greater table steps bgp decision process 
step attribute controlled local neighbor 

highest local 
lowest path length neighbor 
lowest origin type 
lowest med neighbor 
ebgp learned ibgp learned 
lowest igp cost border router local 
lowest router id break ties control route selection additional attributes added advertisements allowing router alter decisions values attributes 
result bgp decision process consisting ordered list attributes routes compared shown table 
router goes list comparing attribute list routes 
routes different values attribute router chooses desirable attribute moves compare attribute list 
route chosen router forward packets 
ordering attributes allows operator influence various stages decision process 
example local preference step decision process 
changing operator force route longer path chosen shorter 
example multi exit discriminator med typically ases connected multiple links indicate peering link reach advertising attribute 
med placed lower decision process allows isp override suggestions setting 
strict ordering attributes decision process simplifies policy expression easier predict outcome making configuration changes 
vendors allow operators disable certain steps decision process typically permit operators put steps different order 
policies violate ordering ignore path length choose lowest med highest may require various hacks complicate router configuration lead unforeseen side effects 
different locations route attribute set policy locally example integer value set propagated local filtered sending neighboring isps 
neighbor example med attribute typically ases connected multiple links indicate peering link reach advertising med attribute compare routes different hop ases 
attributes example route learned external bgp ebgp neighbor internal router speaking bgp ibgp set protocol changed 
collective results decision process routers produce set equally border routers prefix router set equivalent steps decision process compare bgp attributes 
internal router chooses router set closest interior gateway protocol igp path cost reach border router 
example suppose prefix reachable set higher routes set equally border routers contain router select route closest exit point lowest igp cost ra choose route routers choose route 
steps router uses process route advertisements 
import policy applied determine routes filtered eliminated consideration may append modify attributes 
router applies decision process select desirable route 
export policy applied determines neighbors chosen route exported 
isp may implement policy controlling steps modifying import policy filter routes doesn want modifying route attributes prefer routes modifying export policy avoid providing routes certain neighbors 
addition isp modify attributes routes advertises influence neighbors perform route selection 
configuring local policies classes knobs control import export policies 
preference influences bgp route chosen destination prefix 
changing preference done adding deleting modifying route attributes bgp advertisements 
table shows attributes modified import control preference locally modified export change neighbor prefers route 

filtering eliminates certain routes consideration controls exported 
filtering may applied preference inbound filtering preference outbound filtering 
filtering done instructing routers ignore advertisements attributes matching certain specified values ranges 

tagging allows operator associate additional state route coordinate decisions group routers share context boundaries 
key mechanism community attribute variable length string tag routes 
community attribute highly expressive mechanism lending support wide variety complex policies difficult express means 
example community value affect receiving router sets cause route filtered router 
expressiveness gives potential misconfiguration exacerbated fact community attributes usage standardized 
isp implements policies applying configuration commands routers 
configurations typically consist set lists preference filtering tagging rules list session router neighboring bgp speaking router 
configuration language differs vendors key primitive provided route map language construct modify route attributes define conditions determine routes exported peers 
consists parts set conditions indicating map invoked prefix specified value path matches specified regular expression action taken advertisement matches conditions modify specified attribute filter route 
business relationships isps wish control hop selection reflect agreements relationships neighbors 
common relationships isps customer provider isp pays forward traffic peer peer isps agree connecting directly typically exchanging payment mutually benefit roughly equal amounts traffic flow networks backup relationships isps set link event primary routes unavailable due failure 
key ways relationships manifest policy influencing decision process assigning isps prefer customer learned routes routes learned peers providers available 
done sending traffic customers generates revenue isp sending traffic providers costs isp money sending peers skew balance power peering relationship give incentive party receiving traffic tear relationship start charging party 
isp achieve assigning non overlapping range values type peering relationship example values range customers peers providers backup links 
varied range traffic engineering violating constraints associated business relationship described section 
example large isp spanning north america europe may wish avoid forwarding traffic generated customers expensive link 
done configuring european routers higher routes learned european isps giving north american routers lower routes 
controlling route export community attribute routes learned providers peers usually exported providers peers economic incentive isp forward traffic receives provider peer 
done tagging advertisements community attribute signifying business relationship session filtering routes certain community attributes exporting routes peers 
example suppose wishes export routes learned get paid traffic follows 
session routers routers configures import policy appends community attribute route learned sessions indicate route received peer information ordinarily lost bgp route propagates 
appending community attribute exports route onwards internal ibgp network 
second configures export policies match community attribute determine routes get exported particular session router configured export policy filters route community attribute 
traffic engineering business relationships affect relative preferences routes routes available equally preferred 
isps connect multiple locations reduce delay improve reliability increasing number available routes 
secondary goal isps engineer traffic modifying preference business class meet maximize certain performance criteria achieve desired quality availability 
isp modifying import policies applied routers different configuration 
section describe common traffic engineering goals related topic ensuring selected routes stable discussed 
outbound traffic control changing igp costs operators influence outbound traffic flow configuring import policies affect routes get set equally border routers modifying igp link costs 
common goal early exit routing called routing isp forwards traffic closest possible exit point reduce number links packets traverse resulting congestion internal network 
early exit routing known inflate path lengths internet isps exercise early exit routing reduce costs network congestion bgp support alternatives determining global shortest paths multiple isps 
common goal reduce congestion outbound links neighbors 
done load balancing traffic links possible 
outbound traffic engineering done changing 
example suppose wishes shift traffic links link shown link planning take link maintenance 
reduce traffic sends increase traffic sends decreasing routes traversing increasing routes traversing achieving specific level load balance balancing load spare capacity links equal difficult 
key challenge select proper set prefixes change attributes appropriately selecting large set cause traffic shift overloading links 
tedious express long list prefixes router configuration file 
isps deal changing preference prefixes path matches lar expression tweaking regular expression repeatedly control prefixes match 
done manually subject misconfiguration done real time adjust changing load outcome change difficult predict 
automated tools isp predict effects actions 
inbound traffic control prepending med isp internal congestion may exacerbated neighbors neighbors aware isp goals internal topology load internal links due privacy reasons 
mechanism allow isp control traffic receives peering links essential 
unfortunately highly challenging problem requires local isp influence route selection remote isps turn wish limit completely ignore local isp goals 
isp may convince neighbor economic incentives allow isp control traffic receives link neighbor 
done modifying med attribute pair isps connected multiple peering links 
example wanted reduce amount traffic traversing router increase value med attribute advertises causing link preferred routers decreasing load 
shifting traffic links different neighbors challenging unfortunately bgp designed mechanism control route selection ases multiple hops away 
workaround commonly prepend multiple copies number path order artificially inflate path length 
example suppose wishes shift traffic link link prepending additional copies number paths bgp advertisements sends increases path length advertisements causes routes advertised isps desirable comparison 
remote control changing community attributes certain cases isp may need remotely manage router configuration implement desired policy 
example suppose wishes inbound traffic routed suppose peers shown 
prefer direct route change med prepending force alternate routes request manually change router configurations time consuming human operators changes policy traffic engineering purposes 
allow control routing policy respect routes configuring routers map certain community attributes certain local pref values 
desired limit degree control prevent certain policies subverted 
example configure routers map community value allowing disable route allowing chosen routes wants prefer setting higher 
remote control overlapping functionality mechanisms control inbound outbound traffic 
general remote control typically allow customer tell provider perform action behalf 
remote control provides flexibility med allows control inputs earlier steps decision process local pref shown example 
med change relative preference routes remote control configured filter routes perform prepending 
med routes hop compared routes learned neighbors 
med isp neighbors agree advance accept community attributes peer 
highly expressive nature community attributes introduces potential misconfiguration 
example adjacent isps may community attribute mean different things accounting purposes indicate certain customer generated route indicate route filtered 
misconfigured router allows attribute passed removed unintended consequences ensue 
isps typically address careful router configuration publishing list communities actions trigger customers 
addition variety smart routing tools small ases edge internet balance outbound traffic multiple upstream providers 
tools generally appropriate isps dynamically changing traffic lead bgp routing changes visible ases trigger flap damping mechanism withdraws unstable routes routes unstable 
tools focus load balancing multiple outgoing links consider effect traffic flow inside 
scalability misconfigurations faults neighboring isps lead generate excessive rates updates 
sending updates frequently trigger route instability leading poor service quality overload router processing capability memory capacity cause outages router failure 
properly configured set bgp policies improve resilience network problems 
common goals include limiting routing table size filtering community attribute isps want limit routing table size overflow cause router crash 
particularly important issue smaller isps may expensive routers memory capacity 

protection isps isps protect excessive advertisements neighbors filtering long prefixes longer encourage aggregation 
safety check routers maintain fixed session prefix limit limits number prefixes neighbor advertise 
default routing isp small number routes may need entire routing table may configure default route destinations reached 

protecting isps isp reduce number prefixes advertises route aggregation advertising adjacent prefixes neighbor filtered export policy specific prefix advertised 
doing effectively may require knowledge neighbor connectivity discovered signaled bgp protocol manually detected accounted human operators illustrated example 
example topology adding new customer triggers generate new advertisements internal advertisement internal external advertisements 
suppose owns prefix 
allocated subnet router allocated smaller subnets customers connected including new customer allocated subnet 
adding new customer may need changes routers configuration configuration chooses impacts new advertisements generated 
cases 
new advertisements suppose sole provider connects just router case advertising obviating need advertise specific subnets 
just adds statically configured route forward traffic advertisements sent neighbors new advertisements sent internally 
internal advertisement suppose connects routers case need advertise prefix routers know reach 
aggregate advertisement address space send bgp advertisements neighbors 
done configuring tag community attribute advertisements prefix configuring border routers filter routes community attribute 

external internal advertisement suppose connects case aggregate prefix address space advertising longer prefix route reach routers forward packets longest prefix match routers internet prefer route route 
wishes traffic flow links request perform aggregation prefix 
avoid aggregating prefix configuring routers peering append certain community attribute configure border routers export routes containing community attribute 
limit number routing changes suppressing routes flap routing instability undesirable increase cpu load routers increase reaction time important events 
frequent shifting traffic different paths introduce jitter packet loss applications voice ip interfere tcp round trip time calculations 
key mechanism improve routing stability flap damping 
flap damping mechanism limits propagation unstable routes 
works maintaining penalty value associated route incremented update received 
penalty value surpasses configurable threshold route suppressed time unavailable decision process selected 
isp lower penalty threshold improve route stability cost worsening availability 
isps may wish aggressively dampen disable damping certain prefixes example routes root domain name system servers routes customers high availability requirements 
isps aggressively dampen longer prefixes shorter prefixes motivation damping shorter prefix large effect reachability 
done configuring route map matches prefix length specific prefix sets flap damping parameters accordingly 
security highly vulnerable false information bgp updates 
sending false information isp subvert neighbor routing goals cause routers overload fail degrade service quality 
false information significant influence routing source information hops away 
information generated router bugs misconfiguration 
maliciously generated isp neighbor may competing customers vested interest making isp customers dissatisfied service 
isp may wish exercise defensive programming protect attacks 
discarding invalid routes import filtering isps may wish protect customers learning invalid routes performing sanity checks ensure update contents valid propagating internally 
example routes special private addresses address blocks allocated obviously invalid 
advertisements customers prefixes propagated 
isps perform certain sanity checks path example tier isp accept routes customers contain tier isp path 
advertisements containing private numbers path may considered invalid 
isps may configure filters contents public repositories routing configurations called routing registries public reports private disclosures neighbors 
protect integrity routing policies rewriting attributes isp may want prevent neighboring having undue influence routing decisions violation peering agreement 
isp carrying traffic longer distance backbone neighbor behalf 
example suppose isp peers neighbor new york san francisco 
advertising prefix med new york med san francisco peer trick isp having routers direct traffic destination new york peering point san francisco peering point closer 
peer achieve goal configuring san francisco router advertise route nexthop attribute wrongly set ip address new york router 
defend violations peering agreements isp configure import policy delete attributes overwrite expected values 
example import policy set med values isp agreed advance honor neighbor 
similarly import policy set hop attribute ip address remote bgp session remove unexpected community values 
unfortunately techniques sufficient prevent violations peering agreements securing network infrastructure export filtering isp may wish prevent external entities accessing certain internal resources configuring export policies filter bgp advertisements destinations externally reachable 
example isp may protect backbone infrastructure filtering ip addresses number router interfaces 
isp may wish protect certain key internal services filtering addresses hosts running network management software 
courtesy neighbors isp may export filtering invalid routes routes invalid addresses contents measure 
blocking denial service attacks filtering damping denial service attacks degrade service overloading routers extra bgp update messages consuming excessive amounts link bandwidth 
example isp routers run memory neighbor sends route advertisements large number destination prefixes 
protect isp configure bgp session maximum acceptable number prefixes tearing session limit exceeded addition import policy filter prefixes large mask lengths longer 
example neighbor sending excessive number bgp update messages easily cpu resources isp routers 
detecting excessive bgp updates operators modify import policy discard advertisements offending prefixes disable bgp session 
identifying neighbor prefix example peering contracts require peer announce prefix peering points paths length 
isp detect kind inconsistency comparing bgp advertisements peering points collecting detailed measurements traffic traversing peering links 
responsible excessive bgp updates isp aggressively dampen section completely filter updates receives sources 
addition bgp vulnerabilities attack isp customers may subject denial service attack excessive data traffic sent victim hosts 
isp block offending traffic installing route drops traffic destined victim addresses 
routes may statically configured operators may run special bgp session advertises prefixes victims 
routers receiving prefixes session assign hop address associated null route route drops traffic address monitoring system perform analysis traffic 
similar technique isp advertise address blocks known spammers traffic sent addresses 
routes prevent spammers establishing bidirectional communication tcp connection depends receiving syn ack packet isp mail servers
