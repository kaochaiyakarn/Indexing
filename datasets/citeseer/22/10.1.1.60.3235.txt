elman consider manipulating world task complexity agents go developmental stages 
elman showed gradual increase attention span equivalently gradual increase memory size allowed neural networks solve tasks unsolvable starting full grown network 
implementing attention memory limitations agents achieved letting agents ignore complex situations structured topics 
test conducted experiments agents equal number structured unstructured meanings task complexity developing learning scheme adopted 
long agent communicative success ignores structured topics 
subsequently success increases gradually structured topics considered 
success reached topics considered 
surprisingly result successful compositional language emerges higher task complexity 
elaborate experiments needed time scale happens linear function number rules language required ne np case atomic lexical items plus constructions

alternatively complementary fashion development language atomic meanings necessarily precede language structured meanings expertise language increases complexity possible topics
