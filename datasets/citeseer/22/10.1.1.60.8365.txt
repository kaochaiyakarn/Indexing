route discovery route maintenance psr complicated compared counterparts dsr steps described detail 
psr derived dsr psr description contrasted dsr 
route discovery dsr activity begins source node flooding network rreq packets data send 
intermediate node broadcasts rreq gets path destination cache previously broadcast rreq packet 
fact known sequence number rreq sender id consequently intermediate nodes forward received rreq packet 
destination node replies arrived rreq packet tends take shortest path 
psr nodes destination calculate link cost ij cf 
equation add path cost header rreq packet cf 
equation 
intermediate node receives rreq packet starts timer keeps cost header packet min cost 
additional rreqs arrive destination sequence number cost newly arrived rreq packet compared min cost 
new packet lower cost min cost changed new value new rreq packet forwarded 
new rreq packet dropped 
psr destination waits threshold number seconds rreq packet arrives 
time destination examines cost route arrived rreq packet 
timer expires destination node selects route minimum cost replies 
subsequently drop received rreqs 
reply contains cost selected path appended 
node hears route reply adds route cost route cache table 
scheme somewhat increase latency data transfer results significant power saving shown 
route maintenance route maintenance needed reasons mobility connections nodes path lost due movement energy depletion energy resources nodes path may quickly 
case new rreq sent entry route cache corresponding node moved range purged 
second case possible approaches semi global local 
semi global approach source node periodically polls remaining energy levels nodes path corresponding entry route cache path cost increases fixed percentage 
notice results high overhead generates extra traffic 
local approach intermediate node path monitors decrease remaining energy level increase link cost time route discovery result forwarding packets route 
link cost increase goes threshold level node sends route error back source route rendered invalid 
route error message forces source initiate route discovery 
decision dependent remaining battery capacity current node local decision 
psr adopts local approach approach minimizes control traffic 
furthermore assumes transmit power levels ij constant 
enables psr separate effect mobility energy depletion route maintenance 
precisely node generates route error time condition met ci ci current time route discovery time metric appears way capturing dynamics node usage manets 
remaining energy level node decreases link cost node increases 
forces new routing decisions network invalidating cache entries various destinations 
path added cache table node force new decision route finding step node remaining energy depleted certain normalized amount due messages passing path

cache invalidation expensive network route reconstructed flooding network 
handled psr follows 
path discovered node puts remaining energy path cost cache entry 
intermediate nodes check validity path computing cost difference equation 
threshold metric decides invalidate cache 
threshold affects performance psr 
threshold high cache invalidation rarely nodes path 
low cache invalidation rate high may lead unnecessary flooding network
