semantics semantic issue semantic web word semantic different ways generating confusion 
people willing argue advantages rdf xml pushed offer justification rdf semantic able describe means 
possible illustrate different interpretations word semantic modelling relation shown 
firstly computer science term semantic refer description explains interpret particular syntactic structure particular language 
example common distinguish declarative procedural semantics programming languages 
interpretation corresponds arrow marked implication 
second interpretation word semantic comes linguistics exemplified chinese room scenario described argues formal symbol manipulations don intentionality quite meaningless aren symbol manipulations symbols don symbolize 
linguistic jargon syntax semantics 
semantic equivalent encoding decoding arrows 
tim berners lee noted semantic semantic web means machine processable papers articles adopt definition 
causality real world decoding encoding formal system implication modelling relation example argues authors long tradition computer science ai argues declarative approach semantics leads sharable extensible information knowledge sources 
avoid confusion restated follows general principle computer science annotating programs data information helps programmers users infer meaning simplifies comprehension reuse 
crucial phrase infer meaning programs data possess meaning 
just allow infer meaning deduce encoding 
highlights generic problem encoding information important guard ambiguity inferring meaning 
example uaprof tag called 
tag ambiguous 
mean height width entire screen area 
mean width height area screen 
ambiguities firstly order height width secondly means size entire screen 
prerequisite processing metadata particularly encoded different people needs encoded consistent way 
typically done human readable document specification 
specification needs precise order ensure consistency 
addition situations may possible validation ensure specification met 
example certain properties represented finite set strings 
rdf subject exactly issues concerning encoding decoding information data formats limit effective techniques validation syntax checking encoding consistency 
people describe rdf semantic xml may referring properties rdf firstly rdf models common explicit definition carry implication 
interpretation relies statement rdf model interpreted true applications may interpretation 
example uaprof profile effectively set constraints simple values hard constraints met collections bags represent choices 
uaprof processor typically interprets bags disjunctions different interpretation model theory 
secondly rdf uses xml namespaces permits models distinguish different encoding schemes distinguishing schemes different mapping 
equally possible achieve xml 
languages rdf schema allow class hierarchies describe vocabularies mechanisms mandate triple representations applied data formats limitations hierarchical approaches

barriers adoption semantic web complexity rdf xml author opinion barrier adoption rdf semantic web complexity rdf xml xml serialisation rdf 
john sowa notes realize rdf xml intended humanly readable notation don believe verbosity virtue 
rdf xml semantic web noteworthy people working rdf format rdf xml way people encounter rdf 
people encounter complexity may prejudice semantic web 
number examples complexity 
firstly depending rdf xml information written way may verbose attribute value pair xml version 
secondly xml serialisation rdf uses striped syntax users find confusing interpretation elements changes depending stripe document 
arguably rdf xml document syntactic xml document containing attribute value pairs 
thirdly number issues result limitation standard xml tools compatible rdf xml rdf model serialized xml different ways 
means difficult validate rdf xml documents xml schema described validation particularly important applications

currently difficult workarounds suggested author 
fourthly result having deal complexity serialisation rdf parsers typically times slow xml parsers 
may important applications applications cc pp necessary process minimum rdf document request may represent considerable overhead 
notes really need way quickly map large individual instance documents objects rdf offers advantage low level xml rdf designed annotate connect facts multiple logical axes 
mapping adds complexity extra overhead application especially goal access data entire document

groups tried address concerns xml format mapped rdf xml 
solution proposed cc pp ruled thought better address problem canonical format piecemeal individual standards 
standards rdf xml facing problem need simplify xml serialisation rdf 
programmers misuse comp lex tools programmers faced complexity adopt quick dirty workarounds 
common workaround uaprof add additional information existing attributes composite literals free text fields 
overcomes complexities firstly normally properties added uaprof necessary write new schemas properties 
secondly uaprof cc pp current form allow complex grouping attribute values describing choices may necessary specify number hard constraints associated choice 
highlights deficiency way people uaprof rdf noted author opinion highlights regardless data format format complex may misused may negate advantage rdf 
example composite literals defeat main advantage xml means additional parsing necessary literal values 
example composite literals download fun extensions proposed rdf li application mmc wallpaper content type image gif size color rdf li see rdf literal contains number pieces information including mime type data format mime type maximum size data object maximum color depth maximum image height width 
ignoring issue parsing composite literal important note composite literals way compatible rdf model theory literal describes set constraints part logical disjunction 
author highlighted interesting note similar standards xml capability standard created part better constructed arguably xml caused confusion developers 
supporting multiple vocabulary versions rdf supposed better dealing different vocabularies versions vocabularies xml currently standard approach dealing versioned vocabularies 
problem uaprof different vocabulary versions properties duplicated different vocabulary versions 
extensive discussion issue scope number ways solving problem clearly need guidance best way solve 
way solve problem provide mechanism rdf schema say uris equivalent way new versions schema indicate properties unchanged previous versions 
alternative approach duplicate properties place new updated properties new namespace 
possible preferable approach vocabulary uris uris consists identity fragment 
way deal versions clearly separable identity version fragment 
adopt naming convention include version identity www org convention universally adopted uaprof uses different www org profiles uaprof example incompatibilities cc pp uaprof point need common naming approach resources denoting namespaces 
supporting multiple vocabularies semantic web reflects philosophy central naming authorities unrealistic 
presumption multiple vocabularies fact life necessary interoperate 
papers referred semantic interoperability 
possible map properties vocabulary properties vocabulary virtue fact associated uris noted previous section standard way doing rdf schema 
quite thing map encoding strategy vocabulary vocabulary 
example consider example vocabulary entire size screen pixels area screen 
order map encodings necessary piece information size area 
necessary specify relations properties different vocabularies mathematical formulae 
expectation ontology languages solve problem practice type relations may defined determined ontology language 
typically class hierarchy relations rdf schema daml 
possible say subclasses possible define mathematical relationship convert 
furthermore true interoperability relations required vary domains vocabulary possible fairly simple mathematical relations device capability description esoteric maths complex numbers required dealing vocabularies describing electrical devices 
goal semantic interoperability highly desirable defining relations support automatic conversion vocabulary formats highly domain dependent 
furthermore interoperating vocabularies effectively necessary defining interlingua typically elements existing vocabularies 
alternative approach problem having determined interlingua convert existing data interlingua 
cost doing potential benefits increased clarity encoding reduced costs supporting single encoding 
may reasons wanting move standardised vocabularies time

promises semantic web support multiple vocabularies far limited 
way solve problem provide way denoting uri equivalence rdf schema 
alternatively daml oil owl preferred way simple tutorials available handle interoperability vocabulary versions multiple vocabularies 
furthermore noted possible map attributes different vocabularies attributes encoded different ways easy way interoperate different vocabularies 
semantic web community needs propose concrete solutions solve encoding problem needs clearly explain complexities may arise interoperating different vocabularies 
vocabularies need standardised achieving standardised widely adopted vocabularies difficult vocabularies advantages 
semantic web community people dublin core 
dublin core expressed rdf xml html example format agnostic standardised vocabulary 
way avoiding generation multiple vocabularies inherent problems associated interoperating vocabularies create core vocabularies similar dublin core different domains 
core vocabulary enhanced extended different ways applications require users information extract value metadata solely understanding core vocabulary 
avoids user having understand higher level semantic web technologies ontology languages 
example area device independence addressed cc pp perceived important need core vocabulary device attributes web application developers may unable create device independent applications deal multiple vocabularies different device types 
remember encoding problem old saying computing garbage garbage just relevant semantic web area 
creating metadata number reasons data may inaccurate inconsistent 
necessary actively address problems ontology languages validation may help consistency accuracy achieved people agreeing common encoding strategies 

discussed number reached author deployment semantic web technologies resulting cc pp uaprof 
firstly author encourage semantic web community carefully define terms semantic semantic interoperability semantic structuring causing confusion creating unrealistic expectations semantic web technology deliver 
secondly number social behavioural issues effect metadata addressed technology
