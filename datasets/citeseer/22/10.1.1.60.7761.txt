presents soqa simpack toolkit sst ontology language independent java api enables generic similarity detection visualization ontologies 
demonstrate sst usefulness soqa simpack toolkit browser allows users graphically perform similarity calculations ontologies 
current information systems ontologies increasingly explicitly represent intended real world semantics data services 
ontologies provide means overcome heterogeneity providing explicit formal descriptions concepts relationships exist certain universe discourse shared vocabulary refer concepts 
agreed ontological domain semantics danger semantic heterogeneity reduced 
ontologies instance applied area data integration data content explication ensure semantic interoperability data sources 
unfortunately different databases relate ontologies describing semantics 
schema elements linked concepts different ontologies order explicitly express intended meaning 
complicates task finding semantically equivalent schema elements semantic relationships concepts detected schema elements linked 
consequently desirable information similarity ontological concepts 
addition schema integration similarity information useful applications ontology alignment integration semantic web service discovery data clustering mining semantic interoperability virtual organizations semantics aware universal data management 
task detecting similarities ontologies aggravated fact large number ontology languages available specify ontologies 
traditional ontology languages ontolingua notable number ontology languages semantic web shoe daml data semantics described respect ontologies represented various ontology languages 
consequence mechanisms effective similarity detection ontologies capable coping heterogeneity caused different ontology languages 
additionally desirable different similarity measures employed different approaches identify similarities concepts ontologies reflected
