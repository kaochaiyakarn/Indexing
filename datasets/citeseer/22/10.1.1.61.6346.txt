strategy seen analogous wysiwyg see get editing strategy text editing information edited environment users 
concept identification reuse knowledge bases increasingly advantageous defined concepts classes properties instances reused interlinked possible 
especially eases task rearranging extracting aggregating knowledge 
part daily routine inexperienced rare users ontowiki system defined concepts suggested user requested contribute new information 
web environment highly scalable knowledge bases conventional web technologies major obstacles 
conventional web technologies support large data sets handled client browser side 
usually needed working large knowledge bases 
overcome limitation reloading web pages necessary 
approach time consuming requires multiple user interactions 
deployment sophisticated web browsers supporting modern javascript xml technologies mixed server client side web applications possible 
named ajax asynchronous javascript xml early adopters google maps flickr extensive 
maps google com www flickr com ontowiki uses ajax technology interactively propose defined concepts user types new information added knowledge base cf 

realize interactive search uri literals indexed full text searches statement repository 
editing widgets convenient editing differently typed literal data ontowiki system provides library reusable user interface components data editing called widgets 
widgets implemented server side programming language php generate html fragments appropriate cascading style sheet definitions optionally javascript code 
may customized usage specific contexts widget configurations 
widgets currently provided prototypical ontowiki implementation statements allows editing subject predicate object 
nodes edit literals resources 
resources select search existing resources literals literal data conjunction data type language identifier 
widgets specific literal data types dates html fragments 
file widget allows uploading files ontowiki system

ontowiki implements complementary strategies achieve goal 
facet browsing taxonomic structures give users exactly way access information 
furthermore development appropriate taxonomic structures class keyword hierarchies requires significant initial efforts 
go strategy facet browsing allows reduce efforts priori knowledge structuring offering efficient means retrieve information 
facet browsing implemented browser rdf data widely deployed shape tagging systems web folksonomies 
enable users select objects certain facets property values facets set selected instances analyzed 
certain property instances limited set values values offered restrict instance selection 
way navigation data lead empty results 
analyzing property values resource demanding 
enable fast response times ontowiki system caches results property value analysis reuse invalidates cache objects selectively values respective property updated see chapter details 
semantically enhanced full text search ontowiki provides full text search multiple keywords occurring literal property values 
property values single individual containing search string results grouped instances 
ordered frequency occurrence search string 
search results may filtered contain individuals instances distinct class described literal conjunction distinct property cf
