chapter information extraction 
doing information extraction day 
described finding small piece information large amount text 
example people search web usually try find information need search snippets 
read classified ads find particular item apartment rooms normally try pick small description room price location 
information extraction defined computational task convert unstructured information natural language texts structured information lists tables 
piece extracted information normally called relation similar mathematical relation multiple objects 
information extraction item involved relation number set object generally referred named entity ne name person monetary quantity 
example sentences include murderer victim relation named entities person names alice killed bob 
charlie murdered dave 
result information extraction usually user form tables 
sentences system create table shown table 
instance relation murder bob dave respectively event row column role filled objects take 
suppose dates events meta information attached sentence 
system takes unstructured information sentences converts structured information table 
normally information extraction system extracts particular type relation specified user advance 
creating information extraction system expensive task due flexibility natural language 
date murderer victim alice bob charlie dave 
table murderer victim table problems information extraction research roughly divided types 
type research attempts improve performance precision recall stage processing 
basic components named entity tagger parser pattern recognizer improved line research 
type research focuses expanding range possible relations system extract little human effort possible 
section illustrate second issue main focus thesis 
main part formulated pattern matching classification problem 
system tries determine particular string text describes certain relation 
simplest forms regular expression matching 
example obtain murder victim relations simply search texts regular expression pattern za killed murdered za way extract person names involved particular relation 
natural language expressions normally varied 
example tense verb kill murder limited past tense 
additional word phrase inserted sentence 
name person expressed single token actual name directly referred alice referred pronoun furthermore lot possible expressions imply killing word kill murder absorb variety system normally composed layers components part speech tagger named entity ne recognizer shallow deep parser order handle expressions uniform way 
layers form pipeline processing layer tries reduce variations expressions provides uniform outputs layer 
highest level system rely layer manually crafted specification relations extracted 
description target relations called scenario current systems mainly ways obtain specification relations scenario 
write set patterns predefined formal language just regular expression patterns 
people usually craft patterns scenario 
patterns highly depend particular scenario modify significant part system order switch scenario 
way machine obtain patterns automatically human annotated corpora 
annotations highly depend scenario spend huge amount labor corpus annotation scenario 
components ne recognition parsing trained independently reused different tasks specification relation created time user changes scenario 
approaches suffer relatively larger cost compared components systems 
furthermore creating specification relation necessarily guarantee satisfactory extraction results 
certain type relation appear text frequently extracted anyway 
tell certain task feasible place trying 
problem address order mitigate cost associated obtaining specifications creating patterns scratch propose alternative approach discover feasible scenario close user demand improve 
thesis novel approach perform information extraction specifying scenario 
call technique preemptive information extraction 
preemptive obtain large number relations human intervention 
provides preliminary extraction results 
gives opportunity explore kind relations system potentially handle 
expect outputs research information extraction 
order achieve goal introduced important ideas 
firstly separate notion relation detection relation identification 
relation detection task extracting tuple named entities relation 
relation identification figuring kind relation tuples form

people see different types events put separated tables 
furthermore different beat event discovered contrary previous argument case system identify relation 
course insist relation unique means regarded equivalent object event happens different place different time universe unique 
admit group events construct table renders information extraction fundamentally impossible place

major differences approaches research 
approaches rely surface features 
hasegawa takes word sequence banko uses shallow parser extract words entities order identify relation 
difficult take account richer feature set appears global context 
hard capture relation spans multiple sentences 
approaches assume entities involved certain relation adjacent relation binary form 

attempts focused finding somewhat known relations stated concisely explicitly president born understandable surface features rely high frequency relations ensure accuracy 
relations news articles described obscure way approaches suitable finding relations news events reliably small number articles 

approaches employed simpler relation identification mechanism 
hasegawa clustered obtained relations surrounding words group equivalent relations 
banko tried reduce obtained expressions increase uniformity removing words stemming 
approaches suffer variety expressions 
furthermore lack rich features approaches distinguish relations identical expressions semantically different beat election beat sport events section 
handling varied expressions research information extraction easier newspapers expression type events 
case 
creative reporter editor tries various expressions express certain things 
research paraphrasing active 
lin tried acquire similar expressions monolingual corpora comparing arguments predicates 
took set expressions arguments highly correlated 
barzilay tried acquire paraphrases parallel corpora word part speech tag alignment 
attempt apply ideas acquiring patterns done shinyama 
comparable corpora tried take expressions share named entities articles report event 
approaches scale varied expressions reliably 
chapter thesis approach order explore possibility information extraction scenarios 
proposed framework called preemptive information extraction discovers various relations entities news articles unsupervised manner 
important ideas introduced separate notion relation detection relation identification clustering technique identify type newly discovered relations 
built preliminary system uses news sources web performs preemptive reasonable amount time evaluated system terms performance relation coverage 
discussed various aspects system including usability possible products obtained expressions 
system wide section suggest couple improvements performance preemptive system direction 
named entity categories current system uses different categories named entities 
covering ne types increase coverage entities article expect ne types increase number obtainable features clustering 
current system recognize numerical temporal expressions entity 
sekine proposed hundreds ne categories hierarchically organized 
increasing variety features cause data sparseness problem 
able utilize hierarchical nature ne categories provide back infrequent features 
improvement features scoring metrics current system different types features global features bag words local features structure expression 
obviously introduce features 
major drawbacks features difficult create association relation instances mapping object parameters take account 
currently simple unsupervised approach thresholding weights features 
complex binary classifier trained supervised manner 
evaluations relation coverage ace event types thesis evaluation 
cover major information extraction tasks currently tried question coverage obtained relations sufficient 
hope research tries answer question extensively estimating coverage popular categories events 
especially interested kind news events represented table kind events 
great effort may needed establish acceptable agreement categorization events 
broader directions thesis focused idea preemptive news articles 
expect basic idea applied varied types texts technical documents general documents web different application summarization 
time able system basic tool richer research efforts semantics 
possible quantify generality relations meaningful way 
extent person recognize relation solid familiar 
relations various degrees generality form hierarchical structure look 
hope ideas provide useful research natural language processing
