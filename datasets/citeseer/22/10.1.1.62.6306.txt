reactable architecture illustrates reactable system components 
section briefly discuss 

vision vision engine sufficiently fast needs expressive musical instrument providing high temporal resolution tracking fast movements 
reactable vision component open source system tracking type location orientation visual markers real time video stream 
system developed music technology group ross developed initial prototype robinson touch system 
currently processes frames resolution pixels real time ghz athlon system scales problems higher frame rates resolutions sends acquired data protocol control client application 

connection manager dynamic patching central connection manager receives osc messages objects type position orientation data calculates actual patch network simple set rules 
traditional visual programming languages rules manage automatic connection disconnection objects requiring user explicitly declare objects certain number different output connectors sound control sync object checks neighborhood objects provide compatible available ports 
result moving object table surface permanently interferes alters existing connections creating extremely variable synthesizer morphologies resulting highly dynamic environment 
resulting connections additional parameters object angle distance angle connected neighbor sent sound graphics synthesizer components dynamically construct resulting nets decide map raw control data synthesis processes 

audio synthesizer reactable open structure favors existence types higher level objects ones imagine environment max pd sophisticated rhythm melody generators chaotic generators pitch quantizers kind lower level sound synthesis processing algorithms techniques 
currently implemented reactable objects categorized different functional groups generators audio varied number control audio filters audio audio variable number control controllers control control filters control control audio audio clock synchronizers 
current implementations synthesizer pure data 
possible write synthesis modules system supports osc allows instantiate connect delete objects dynamically 

visual synthesizer visual feedback implemented similar way audio synthesizer constituting full visual synthesizer 
connection manager sends information objects connection state parameters engine interprets information draws objects correct positions lines connect 
correct visualization audio connections represented waveforms time domain graphics engine additional connection audio synthesizer receives information data flows synthesizer 
shows example visualization

continuum traditional modular visual programming synthesizers clear separation building playing patch instrument editing execution mode 
editing usually lengthy development process leads final stable instrument patch execution mode controlled screen available controller device 
reactable built played time 
piece constructed scratch starting empty table single snapshot re constructed table actual performance 
fundamental characteristic instrument evolve change setup 
building instrument equivalent playing vice versa 
remembering repeating construction building process compared reproduction musical score 
reactable establishes real continuum composition performance composition performance 
reactable connection paradigm moving object table surface performer able permanently interfere alter existing connections creates extremely variable synthesizer morphologies just reach hand 

model objects table permanently sense parameters depending relative position net topology angle orientation 
allows subtle intimate control 
moving twisting objects allows precisely control parameters voluntarily sudden morphology changes discontinuities 

hand fingers interaction painter models hands play important role manipulate reactable objects treated 
cutting sound stream done finger style hand gesture 
feature promotes physically intense playing 
grabbing lifting dropping objects hands cutting flows gestures touching objects limited computer vision engine speed 
current implementation predicts input frame rate go hz hz attainable adequate camera 
soon reactable allow free finger drawing directly table surface 
functionality include drawing envelopes spectra depending objects situated nearby 

reactable collaborative multi user instrument reactable supports flexible number users predefined roles allows simultaneously additive users working independent audio threads multiplicative users sharing control audio threads behaviors 
way physical objects visually virtually augmented reactable constitutes perfect example local remote multi user instrument 
local collaboration scenario players share physical objects space collaboration expanded connected net 
sharing virtual space performers move physical objects local table projected remote tables movements may modify shared audio threads provoking interactions displaced objects 
third collaboration scenario remote users join reactable session software simulation virtual table impact remote tables tangible interaction 

reactable versions reactable planning complex objects flexible plastic tubes continuous multi parametric control little wooden dummy octave keyboards combs comb filters everyday objects 
currently reactable objects plain passive meaning come cables switches buttons whatsoever rule possibility smart objects may incorporate additional internal electronics order retrieve additional sensor data coming hitting squeezing bending bouncing case 
case achieved completely transparent way wireless technology example performer treat objects equal way 
conclude affirm new designed instruments reactable originate exploring possibilities specific technology perspective mimicking known instrumental model 
comes experience designing instruments making music listening watching way played
