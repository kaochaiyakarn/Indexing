ii environmentally initiated contrast successful probe facilitate reflection environmentally initiated methods effective 
cases students taken surprise image voice popped pda heard ambient sound enjoyed talking facilitator 
times missed sounds 
due students ongoing activity simply seeing hearing 
prevalent delivery ambient sounds concealed wireless speakers 
students simply failed hear sounds 
reason sounds ambient simply blended rich array sounds wood 
example song chaff sounded just real thing natural woodland time 
digital information pervasively delivered pdas successful getting student attention 
noticing image voice students held pdas metal detectors find 
came showed pleasure having discovered 
instances led explore seen pda woodland conjunction discussion relevant ecological issues 
example sighting pda students sought locate corresponding wood explore discuss lived 
instances information initiated discussion helped links different organisms habitat 
occasions students chose ignore information ongoing activity 
example pair students information bushes discovering feathers dead bird consequently paid little attention 
example looking wood student pda felt compelled look just pda relay remote facilitator continued looking 
findings study suggest environmentally initiated methods digital augmentation lead discovery discussion richness woodland masking information student activities somewhat limited 
follow study attempted overcome problems developing hybrid method environment triggered sounds student location students decide play ii replacing pinging images pda method student required report discuss remote facilitator seen significance 
remote facilitator send back confirmatory relevant information questions provoke reflection described students 
aim enable students hear sounds time

study pairs students aged took part followup study 
design learning experience study main difference design mode type digital augmentation 
student initiated hoped pairs students talked different examples organisms observed woodland remote facilitator exploration 
led discussion students provoked exploration woodland 
rule facilitator sent back images matched students identified 
odd occasion facilitator inadvertently sent back pda wrong image students described 
interestingly problematic mismatches led discussion caused students look organisms 
times remote facilitator unable identify particular type organism tree student description sent images different possibilities 
students basis see grew habitat 
images sent back students stored pda providing record organisms seen re accessed time 
students looked back images match new organisms discovering 
enabled students think explicitly similarities differences organisms environment 
sum method provoked explicit reflection students method study requiring describe comment higher level detail seen importance habitat remote facilitator 
ii hybrid method difference follow study sounds triggered students walked passed pinger time delivered ambient horn 
beep flashing light indicated arrival sound 
students manually pressed button listen actual sound 
changing way sounds delivered enabled students decide listen automatically played 
additionally sounds represent various relevant biological processes root uptake 
reason provoke students contemplating puzzling significance context woodland 
study showed ambient horn successful hidden speakers getting students listen reflect sounds 
students paid far attention sounds study 
horn indicated sound heard students stopped listened 
immediately times seconds finished doing 
subsequently discussed thought represented described remote facilitator prompted think sound related plant animal processes 
evidence suggest sounds facilitate students making links organisms environment 
example students exploring began focusing collecting data finding plants readings 
hearing discovering sound representing root uptake pairs began thinking explicitly factors important plant growth 
plant pair commented getting moisture tree light nutrition carbon dioxide 
research concerned design assemble handheld pervasive wireless technologies support learning processes outdoors 
particular interested promoting augmented learning encouraging children step learn physical experiences step reflect higher levels contextually relevant information delivered accessed move 
findings supported students explicit links finding various types digital augmentation exploring discovering physical environment 
particular live data enables monitoring students discover woodland moisture levels pre recorded data enables framing information available live orienting cueing students think currently doing higher level abstraction 
study showed student initiated modes digital augmentation provide impetus reflection discussion 
independent activity promoted involving self initiated exploration hypothesis building testing peer facilitator collaboration reflection case 
main reasons student initiated method gives students higher levels control access information 
environmentally initiated methods provide surprise ongoing activity overlooked distract ongoing activity 
different devices play interact digital information affect students receiving 
pdas effective providing intermittent information triggering stepping 
danger focusing student attention technology example metal detectors goal environmentally initiated augmentation perceived students finding hidden sounds images 
contrast home devices ambient horn probes readily appropriated children manner intended 
children age technology savvy instantly took readily understood purpose 
potential problems providing children number devices simply hands get full making difficult touch pick things woodland
