capturing exploiting context personalized search personalized search capturing exploiting user related context information improve search accuracy 
existing retrieval systems support personalized search ignoring user search context 
describe ongoing user centered adaptive information retrieval project aims capturing exploiting naturally available user context personalized search 

precise understanding user information need essential achieving optimal retrieval performance 
existing retrieval systems take user query sole source knowledge user information need 
query usually consists short keywords generally insufficient giving complete accurate picture user really looking 
context information user query necessary improving retrieval performance 
personalized search essentially boils capturing exploiting related user context information query improve search accuracy 
short term dynamic long term static implicit immediately viewed document past query log explicit judged relevant documents occupation hobbies table typology examples user context shown table kinds user context information potentially exploited 
explicit context consists information user explicitly implicit context refers context information naturally available user interacts retrieval system 
explicit context information reliable implicit context available requires extra effort user

developed specific retrieval models exploiting immediate search context statistical language model experiments show models achieve better retrieval performance context

obtained experience evaluating context sensitive ir 
summarize current directions 

decision theoretic framework context sensitive ir exploit context personalized search general way view retrieval problem decision problem contextual information normally available query documents considered optimize retrieval decision 
general response user action system choose optimal system action take 
example user action may submitting query system response may returning list document summaries 
advantage treating retrieval generally decision making problem may treat user viewing document search results user action system respond updating user model user information need 
case response affect user immediately may imagine user views document returns see search results system choose rerank unseen search results updated user model 
bring maximum benefit context user exploit context soon available respond immediately new piece context information 
eager feedback precisely project aiming 
developed decision theoretic framework optimizing interactive information retrieval eager user model updating system responds user action choosing system action optimize utility function 
specifically soon observe new piece evidence user system attempt perform tasks compute project web site cs uiuc edu current user model update belief user information need choose response minimizes loss function 
example immediately user views document knowledge viewed document summary probably relevant rerank unseen results minimize loss function favors decision rank relevant documents irrelevant ones 
traditional retrieval paradigm retrieval problem cast matching query documents rank documents relevance values 
result retrieval process simple independent cycle query submission result display inadequate exploiting context 
decisiontheoretic framework developed generalizes traditional retrieval paradigm allows exploit user search context quite general way 

language models context sensitive ir instantiating general decision theoretic framework described specific retrieval methods obtain specific retrieval models rank documents search context 
case study developed different language models implicit feedback information improve retrieval accuracy interactive information retrieval 
kl divergence retrieval model basis propose treat context sensitive retrieval generally estimating query language model current query search context information 
proposed tested statistical language models incorporate query clickthrough history kl divergence model including linear interpolation fixed coefficients bayesian interpolation online bayesian updating batch bayesian updating 
general experiment results show implicit feedback information especially clickthrough data effectively efficiently improve retrieval performance requiring additional effort user 

context sensitive ir system search agent developed client side search agent called embedded web browser capture user search context perform implicit feedback 
search agent incorporates models algorithms proposed section dynamically rerank search results reflect updated knowledge user information need new piece implicit feedback available 
chose context sensitive ir client side server side remarkable advantages 
user need worry privacy infringement big concern personalized search 
second richer category user interactions mouse movement easily captured implicit feedback 
third computation needed personalization storage user profile done client side server burdened 
implemented specific techniques capture exploit types implicit feedback information identifying related immediately preceding query query corresponding search results select appropriate terms expand current query exploiting viewed document summaries dynamically rerank document seen user 
user studies show search agent improves performance popular search engine google search agent built 

evaluation context sensitive ir evaluation context sensitive ir poses special challenges due difficulty collecting appropriate user interaction data cleanly identifying baseline methods 
example challenge evaluating implicit feedback algorithms exist suitable test collection evaluation 
study trec ap data create test collection implicit feedback information quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback algorithms 
best knowledge test set implicit feedback 
evaluating search agent conducted user study involving people 
participants asked web search selected query topics trec terabyte track trec web track topic distillation task relevance judgments search results 
comparing ranking incorporates context information google original ranking see context information beneficial 
method applicable evaluating similar context sensitive retrieval systems 

current extended ways 
study retrieval framework sequential decision making interactive information retrieval study optimize parameters context sensitive retrieval algorithms 
explored simple language models incorporating implicit feedback information 
interesting develop sophisticated models better exploit query history data 
example may treat clicked document summary differently depending current query generalization refinement previous query 
study important user interactions 
client side search agent capture exploit user actions mouse movement dwelling time document may strong correlation document relevance 
currently search agent considers retrieval system black box server full text indexing capability 
study client side search agent collaborate remote retrieval system provide powerful contextual search
