quality service 
frequently discussed non functional properties quality service attributes 
attributes define minimal level quality service provide 
cover different aspects property locative availability defines time frame service online day am pm 
furthermore availability rate defined specifies minimal percentage service available day availability rate defines service available day 
response time measures duration sending request receiving result service 
price 
service price refers monetary amount paid requester allowed service 
price defined absolute amount specific currency 
furthermore may discounts penalties influence price service 
payment method 
specify price paid properties payment instrument duration charging style required 
payment instrument refers type payment paying cash credit card duration defines time period payment completed 
services different ways specified charging style invocation certain time period 
security 
security attributes allow define identification methods encryption methods supported service 
identification methods refer kerberos pin input similar systems 
encryption methods defines supported protocols communication service 
trust 
various different ways define trust levels respect web services 
way check referrals means reputation systems

kinds knowledge encoded techniques fuzzy logic 
vague knowledge rules fuzzy logic important perspective evaluating values attributes complex dependencies attribute values 
rules play important role application domains approximation desired value attribute acceptable 
example consider controlling train 
desired train arrives station halts certain fixed position 
calculating exactly brake applied position speed passengers sit comfortable difficult 
considering acceptable train stops small distance mark automatic control train easier
