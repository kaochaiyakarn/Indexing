focus everyday privacy users manage privacy environments 
social technical regulatory phenomena commonly lumped term privacy want clear mean everyday privacy 
concerned individuals regular voluntary disclosure dynamic contextual information remote identifiable parties ubicomp systems 
focus cases users interested sharing personal information right people right level detail 
people want disclose contextual information facilitate arrivals meeting place convey sense presence intimate companions 
key people choose selectively disclose information people social professional networks 
view everyday privacy positions nuanced social practice functional goal 
mean secrecy anonymity important 
reasonable cases disclosing information colleagues friends family 
problem secrecy anonymity focus extreme case cover situations everyday life people want share information 
question share personal information right people right level detail secrecy anonymity possibly solution cases 
goal research threefold understand nature range privacy concerns respect ubicomp systems elucidate conceptual model everyday privacy ubiquitous computing environments model develop user interfaces provide users appropriate control feedback mechanisms managing privacy 
previous performed questionnaire study investigate relative importance key factors determining individuals privacy preferences ubicomp proposed design framework minimizing information asymmetry software architecture privacy aware systems 
workshop focus conceptual framework interfaces endusers manage everyday privacy 
core framework providing feedback control precision context information disclosed 
user interfaces instantiate aspects framework discuss results formative evaluation 
example scenarios discussing privacy describe scenarios trying support believe realistic years 
alice workplace small beacons setup room chirp room number 
alice pda informed room knowing 
somewhat concerned privacy environment sets things workers see floor level 
bob purchased new location enabled phone knows meters 
wants set family close friends see carol going block party people 
friends just met 
wants location available new acquaintances easier coordinate gets lost wants provide access limited amount time just met 
david throwing surprise party home 
wants ensure ubicomp system determine friends prior surprise 
user control disclosures central model everyday privacy ubicomp ability adjust precision dynamic contextual information disclosed people 
control precision provides control information density disclosure 
precise disclosure information disclosed 
example disclosing location duration seen downtown san francisco decidedly revealing disclosing strip club market street past hours adjusting precision useful disclosing information institutions 
example scenario alice sharing location workers feel comfortable letting know precisely right 
adjust level disclosure modifying spatial precision location information th floor room temporal precision seen minutes ago right finds level comfortable 
adjusting precision useful disclosing information individuals help people manage persona wish reveal 
goffman explains people behave way impress observers acting accordance roles occupy relation observers 
usually intuitively convey activities socially contextually appropriate 
similarly control precision allows people manage ubiquitous computing environments 
users able convey acting appropriately respect observer lack information conveys likelihood acting inappropriately 
observer left infer range possible activities 
observer trust subject sufficiently low inspire assumption inappropriate activity matter observer subject social process amount ubicomp technology replace 
approach relies ubiquitous computing applications infrastructures having level inherent ambiguity purposes plausible deniability 
analogy person answer cell phone call technical reasons outside cell having phone phone social reasons busy wanting talk caller right 
result person called simple model protecting privacy caller tell person answering 
similar situation exist ubiquitous computing systems ambiguity exists due sensor noise incomplete wireless coverage forgetting carry devices situational subjective desire 
range validity reasons intentional unintentional imprecision creates ambiguity conditions disclosure thick observers bother deconstructing 
cultural accommodation imprecise knowledge part remote observers engender norm plausible deniability 
imprecision information focus adjustable precision contextual information different ideas 
principle minimum asymmetry 
high level think ubicomp systems having knobs controlling information going knob controlling feedback coming back personal information 
main idea minimum asymmetry systems built knob minimized needed little information necessary goes second knob maximized information information comes back 
second adams perceptions privacy multimedia environments 
adams identified key factors determine subject perception privacy sensed environments subject trust perceived recipients subject cost benefit analysis perceived usage information subject subjective judgment information sensitivity context information collected 
supporting evidence importance factors earlier questionnaire study 
subjects reported stronger likelihood adjust precision disclosure depending identity inquirer situation time inquiry 
developing model sought provide users appropriate feedback control factors 
usage difficult represent focused recipients sensitivity context 
model managing everyday privacy ubicomp emphasizes feedback identities control precision disclosed context adjusting sensitivity optional contextual triggers automatically adjust precision specific contexts 
ordinal precision scale user interfaces everyday privacy effective providing control feedback simple 
developed simple ordinal scale uniformly represent various precision levels combined greatest amount control simple interaction

pc user interface creating assigning faces 
face represents set privacy preferences inquirer request user situation 
called situations 
example situation studying consist location library activity reading computing 
preferences took form faces encapsulated precision preferences various information dimensions including name location activity companions 
metaphor inspired goffman analysis individuals different faces different people different social situations 
example face student specify precise disclosure identity location activity approximate disclosure companions 
users assign face handle disclosures inquirer situation user

second prototype managing everyday privacy instant messenger interface style 
top half shows current user status bottom half shows status user friends 

example situ configuration 
people receive requests personal information able set preferences activity happens trying predict situations 
bob part user list friends 
bob request user location request forwarded participants messaging typically interface 
single user aspect sees context create situations 
example care location activity 
encapsulating contextual variables situations proved superfluous confusing 
additional confusion occurred subjects saw difference situation activity 
second face metaphor obfuscated true meaning preferences information precision 
subjects clear face metaphorical little precision say disclosed location 
third fact static dynamic information combined face caused confusion 
faces encapsulated dynamic information location activity static information name profile 
static information sensitive unfamiliar dynamic sensitive respect familiar 
combining static dynamic information caused problems defining appropriate faces 
lastly requiring explicit complex structure managing user privacy untenable 
privacy highly subjective process easily captured arguably disrupted system requiring explicit preferences set priori 
sum faces interface modeled goffman theory literally interface facilitate intuitive impression management practice interface 
believe lightweight flexible approach warranted possibly involving fly adjustment disclosure precision small set inquirer groups 
prototype instant messenger metaphor complexity involved faces metaphor making major changes second prototype screenshot progress 
basing design instant messenger clients 
im interface style users familiar shares characteristics trying accomplish including adding removing friends customizing status messages disclose location activity organizing friends groups 
second focusing exclusively managing dynamic contextual information static information 
formative studies indicated people difficult combine single conceptual model 
ubiquitous computing focuses representing dynamic state decided focus managing aspect 
sense friends presumably know static information 
third modifying interface show real time data reflecting status current user top half status user friends bottom half 
rationale new interface cover basic tasks adding removing friends setting preferences viewing current status 
displaying current user status provides feedback system knows user making sort privacy mirror 
fourth modifying preferences set groups regardless situation individuals 
decision scaling purposes 
felt person similar preferences people group tedious set individual preferences 
situations eliminated altogether earlier study suggested identity important situation disclosing information 
fifth added invisible mode familiar interaction technique instant messenger 
provides clear simple mechanism users want hide information people 
sixth added ability situ configurations see 
problems setting preferences priori difficult predict possible circumstances 
address created messaging interface easy adjust preferences fly 
user notified request handled existing preferences instant message window sms example 
user decisions kind information share 
shows situ configurations share information temporarily 
bob request user current location 
bob user friends list requesting detailed location currently allowed see message sent user 
user decide level information disclose long 
user interface situ configurations currently implemented yahoo instant messenger 
part second prototype represents distinct user interface managing different aspects privacy 
interface meant setting preferences desktop computer interface meant managing configurations fly mobile devices 
second prototype built top context fabric infrastructure 
currently process connecting user interface backend completed development interface 
preparing user evaluation interfaces 
discussion progress look fits larger picture analyzing designing constructing evaluating privacy sensitive applications ubiquitous computing 
include centralized nexus managing privacy right approach 
tygar point security domain security usually secondary goal 
people generally sit computers wanting manage security want send email browse web pages download software want security place protect things hand decentralizing control feedback multiple applications lead inconsistency confusion inefficiency 
possibility may hybrid solution having centralized privacy control panel application specific controls similar printers managed modern operating systems 
issue arose evaluation takes great deal setup privacy preferences 
making explicit people implicitly intuitively privacy secondary goal 
better approaches helping users initial setup 
possibility web crawling combined data mining address books instant messenger contacts emails sent received come rough cut groups settings people manually twiddle settings 
possibilities 
currently giving mobile phone number way lowering precision 
certain level plausible deniability 
example contact phone turned carrying outside cells simply talk right 
hand access location provide various granularities various durations 
socially acceptable give temporary access information providing precise information 
ways adding level ambiguity plausible deniability purposes smooth things 
higher level kinds intentional ambiguity needed ubicomp 
build directly systems intentional flaws 

focused primarily everyday privacy give people limited access dynamic information 
alternative push model pass information request example passing current location call 
different tradeoffs architectural styles terms privacy utility deployment robustness 
kinds services supported consequently architectural style common
