question proposed features impact performance scale context system subject perpetual change 
discuss question propose concrete schema implementing ideas 
expounded additional typing information composed parts general definition available types hierarchical organization concrete instances typed links articles 
furthermore data changes continuously 
considering fact processing single query usually require information types links possibly category schema may wonder proposal realistic 
argue linking information deals connections articles completely local article specified 
words possible process link types time article edited attach information article 
changes articles affect validity extracted statements 
clear required processing articles simple task compared say link extraction general implementation easily adapted handle 
true processing type hierarchies similar existing category hierarchies 
representing extracted link data internally straightforward additional customized database table 
fully exploit new features suggest go 
example writing system query answering scratch see en wikipedia org wiki template movie 
example geographical entities related links type located cities located countries islands located oceans 
user may want narrow search obtain rivers lakes located germany requires evaluation typed links categories 
quite difficult task 
luckily systems emerging structure typed links relations categories classes articles instances exist subject intense research years 
desirable provide wikipedia structural information output format understood available applications 
owl rdf format tailored express kind semantic information described supported relevant applications due status official standard 
wikipedia utilize numerous powerful applications freely available online just providing owl rdf output 
considering possible visibility effort research projects provide dedicated wikipedia search engines servers 
owl rdf enjoys property specified completely modular xml syntax order statements relevant 
simply combine owl rdf fragment article arbitrary order obtain valid knowledge base fed existing tools 
similarly straightforward automatically generate owl rdf specifications express current categories hierarchy classified articles 
additional features new feature introduced far typed links articles organized hierarchy 
offers plenty new possibilities part structural information specified owl supported applications 
give short account useful properties supported 
constraint having links articles may strict point 
example looking actors sean name able rely article article links articles names linked actors articles 
owl supports datatypes express relations instances articles strings integers 
likewise possible find convenient syntax expressing relations wikipedia source code allowing users select pieces text interpreted way similar hyperlink syntax effect compiled article 
advantage datatypes come additional background information 
example size person specified integer possible search persons smaller size 
size just article name machine usually able interpret smaller relation appropriately 
considered relationships useful wikipedia 
consider example geographical location city defined link type located karlsruhe located germany 
hand germany located europe considering want infer karlsruhe located europe 
owl possible query answering having give additional located links article karlsruhe 
just specify property located transitive located located located advanced feature clearly importance wikipedia similar transitive relations relative ingredient common application domains 
advantage users decide relation transitive just types usual possibly wonder wikipedia knows karlsruhe europe written article 
transitivity particular link type switched time course ignored application support feature owl leading fewer results 
possible situation types relations inverse 
example link types capital countries cities capital cities countries 
clearly types just inverse specifying sufficient know 
expressed owl easy imagine interface type page edit property 
addition owl supports specification axioms describing domain range relation 
example may want require article outgoing link type capital belongs category country constraints disallow editing step may serve detect problematic specifications stage 
fact due aforementioned locality principle ensures performance domain range axioms available editing article 
classical interpretation domain range owl change classification reject specification 
example declare berlin capital germany require capital belong category city infer berlin city 
looking cities get berlin explicitly specified article 
inferred domain range just ignored querying choice concrete implementation 
owl support statements constraint number things allowed related links type 
instance may want require country exactly capital specified 
usage additional information left software working exported owl specification 
implementation plan section sketch steps needed put approach practice 
intention provide concrete roadmap introducing desired new features gradually working system 

step needs represent simple management system link types 
start sufficient adapt current functionality wikipedia category system 
note categories link types usually show explicitly article page way accessing pages 
feasible possibility create simple search listing function type management system 

definite syntax typing links articles needs fixed implemented 
extracting information source code fairly simple decide additional internal representation link types owl export suffices 
link information independent article 
especially types associated particular occurrence link article describe general relationship articles 
duplicate connections type eliminated 
furthermore include way access pages link types occur article defined 
done way similar solution templates templates listed bottom edit page 

point public may taken notice enhancements 
order promote new editing options wikipedia helpful start initiative typing links particular subdomain wikipedia 
task best solved cooperation dedicated overview limited topic 
domain experts project develop hierarchy link types incorporate types part articles project
