monadic compositional parsing context maltese case study give overview monadic parser combinators proceed build machinery express grammars context dependent 
propose solutions problems arising context dependent grammars particular case natural language parsing 
parsing simple maltese grammatical constructs illustrate approach 
stage primary aim extension parser combinators deal context 
remains established useful approach substantial natural language grammar subsets 
haskell parser combinators haskell strongly typed language types just identify certain problems compile time shape direct solution 
sense start asking type parser 
parser function reads input stream tokens particular type 
consuming part input expect return back object parsed part input stream 
parser may match input way return list possibilities newtype parser parser may think cases extremely general parser type overkill producing complete list matches may interested possible solution 
comes rescue case 
interested parse input just take element output list parser take care rest 
tag parser stops applying parser directly define function peel tag away parse parser proceed construct number simple parsers 
simplest parser returns constant value leaves input stream intact parser parser simple parser simply fails parser parser define parser fails boolean condition false check bool parser check true check false useful parser checks input stream fully consumed fin parser fin parser case parsing single object input parser parser case xs xs gordon pace parsers easily packaged monads offer reusable structure functional programs 
instance monad parser return parser return parser parser parser parser parser results parse parser concat parse results offers means creating parser returns value second allows run parsers sequentially 
allows combine parsers obtain compound parsers return haskell provides alternative ways monad code look return return useful parser reads symbol input stream succeeding satisfies property bool parser property check property return parsing particular character string input stream defined terms combinator return cs cs return cs similarly define parsing vowel consonant elem useful combinator operator tries parser fails uses parser case parse parse rs rs operator resolves potential non determinism parsers giving priority operand 
fact parser type handle non determinism deterministic ways 
non deterministic choice parsers easily defined framework monadic compositional parsing context maltese case study parser parse parse parsing word list possibilities expressed recursively mzero ps ps parsing character word list possibilities expressed map map define regular expression operators parsers star accept number repetitions parser star parser parser star parser parser xs star parser return xs return parsing word space space separated text easier plus isspace plus star return parsing context maltese definite article look maltese article see different approaches parsing natural language parser combinators previous section 
english parsing definite noun combinators trivial article noun independent 
dog cat mouse computer maltese article complicated 
maltese article rules governing maltese article quite intricate combining morphological rules aid pronunciation words grammatical rules 
indefinite nouns maltese extra 
basic form definite article constructed adding il noun 
dog il dog 
unfortunately matter simple 
nouns starting number letters consonants initial letter noun assimilated article replacing accomodate rules 
snake snake 
furthermore nouns starting vowel sound literally sun letters 
singular 
gordon pace possibly preceded silent letter drop initial article 
orphan orphan 
words starting consonants take precede noun initial example space space 
matters worse word preceding article ends vowel article loses initial start 
example kiel il ate dog fried dog intricate rules indicate parsing definite noun maltese straightforward english 
logical flow consequence flows right noun left article 
limited sense case english parsing indefinite noun finding 
finding english look noun starting vowel maltese situation complex matching lexicon impossible deduce school definite form 
furthermore maltese definite nouns reveal important issue 
usually compositional parsers write parser article parser nouns able simply combine parse noun article 
done case english definite noun 
case maltese possible add constraints ensuring article noun match 
simpler situation arise parsing indefinite article english 
propose simple enrichment haskell parser combinators enabling define constructs compositionally refering context parsed object 
compositional context parsing parser look ahead differentiate equivalent input looking input arrive 
environment imperative language state system remember relevant information past context 
leads problem haskell provides global state 
augment parser monad encapsulate updatable state deal problem lacks symmetry looking context state parser combinators 
looking current parser structure handle looking ahead input context 
generalise look ahead parser fails failed succeeds returning information unit type leaves input untouched lookahead parser parser lookahead parser case parse return return write compositional parser indefinite english article maltese definite article lookahead alternative grammatical view article consists acquires initial preceded vowel noun attached starts consonant 
monadic compositional parsing context maltese case study lookahead return note maltese article parser works nouns starting consonants extended deal cases similar manner 
technique describe context terms combinators resulting composable parser 
parsing definite maltese noun expressed matching article noun transparently taken care 
looking past technique described previous section enables describe different cases maltese definite noun nuance catered initial article dropped preceding word ends vowel 
ideally past context parser transformer able specify condition weak lookback occurrences matching initial maltese definite article replaced parser solving problem 
parser type hold past information needs enriched enable refer past context type stream newtype parser parser stream stream basically just changed notion stream sequence symbols pair sequences symbols enabling recall symbols consumed ones 
change composed parsers 
may involve slight changes foundational parser combinators 
example parser need redefined follows parser parser ws case ws define lookback additional information lookback parser parser lookback parser ws case parse star fin ws return return ws note parser match final part consumed input stream compose star consumes part stream 
clearly raises major efficiency issues 
definition star ensures order possible parses longest 
natural language look backs look short part stream interested match ensures match quickly search stopped 
part overhead star past stream repeated calls star avoided splitting input passing directly parser performance improvement 
interestingly definitions monad operators return remain unchanged despite fact variables refer different objects 
gordon pace solution improve efficiency parser applied consumed input sufficiently simple able express reverse parser matches strings reversed 
cases simply apply reversed parser reversed past parsers composition 
programmer required provide reversed parser solution lead unreadable confusing code 
alternative enrich parser library able identify subset parsers automatically reversed apply reverse parser looking back 
context parsing maltese verbs approach previous section allows express parsers conditions context input stream applied 
approach works case local context ideal apply word morphology phonological rules depend immediate context 
approach suited certain applications context may set complex rules text residing far location parsed information gathered result parsing 
furthermore context parsing means duplicating parsing effort information may parsed multiple times context main text 
approach enable adapting context modify global state order pass information 
unstructured approach lead non reusable code 
haskell pure functional language side effects means monad equivalent pass state 
enables tailor state limited repertoire operators ensure functionality available possibility abuse 
maltese verbs form tense equivalent infinitive maltese verbs past third person singular conjugated form verb 
equivalent ride rode 
maltese verbs origin fall forms types 
main form finds verbs consonants case 
forms derived form 
dealing regular verbs form 
conjugation regular verbs form straightforward follows pattern example general case person singular second person singular third person singular male third person singular female person plural second person plural third person plural remarks table infinitive verb reconstructed singular lack second vowel plural forms ii encountering leaves ambiguity referring second person singular female form third person singular 
rules easily check verb infinitive list known verbs verb verb elem 
letters ci indicate consonants verb vi indicate vowels 
symbols represent actual letters occurring verb 
attributes monadic compositional parsing context maltese case study recurring non local dependency natural language parsing matching gender tense case different parts sentence 
enable matching need means setting attributes particular values 
attribute may set multiple times ensure value 
manner parsing noun verb may set gender attribute subject sentence 
gender set matches parsing phrase fail 
case attributes may take number possibilities non determinism try cases 
example encountering maltese verb deduce subject second person singular female third person singular 
having non deterministic parse yielding ensure context deciding gender person subject possibilities fail simply reduce non determinism 
operations perform attributes reading renaming 
reading necessary enable act value set 
renaming attribute may necessary able adapt attributes acquire information 
example parsing noun set attributes noun simple sentence set attributes subject verb object 
discover particular noun phrase subject phrase able rename attribute 
merge state monad parser monad handle attributes type state attributevalue newtype parser state stream state stream previous case need redefine basic parser combinators derived combinators unmodified 
code defining operators classes monad remains unchanged 
define number functions update read attribute list attributevalue parser attribute parser memory attribute memory attribute memory parser string attribute name parser memory isdefined attribute name memory lookup attribute name memory memory similar definitions define updates list attributes renames attribute 
define parser maltese verbs decide attributes setting 
verb derive information subject 
pieces information gathered grammatical person gender number 
set attributes respectively 
parsing letter verb indicates person 
simplify presentation split cases singular plural 
code singular case 
plural case similar 
singular gordon pace case third male second third female functions express parse conjugated verb 
previous case separate parsing verbs conjugated singular plural form 
singular form check parsing verb simply non deterministic choice parsing singular plural verb parsing simple verb place parser nouns setting attributes gender person number construct simple sentence parser transitive verbs follows noun subject gender person number noun object gender person number example strings tag names values stored may clearer structured type allowing group certain attributes case attributes refer subject need identical attributes object phrase 
strings ease presentation 
approaches introduce context sensitivity parsing natural language compositionally parser combinators 
allows refer context parsers second instantiation state monad operators refined natural language parsing 
combinator approach programming extremely versatile introduces level abstraction enables program re interpretation 
store parser function performs parsing behaviour changing basic combinators store structure example fact parser maltese definite noun built sequential composition parsers 
information lost reconstruct parsing function description 
having access structure enable analyse perform operations grammar impossible perform avenues explore approach distinction structure behaviour important domains hardware description 
combinator library hardware description simulate circuit just having circuit described function inputs outputs sufficient 
count number gates circuit measure longest combinational path clearly require access underlying structure 
monadic compositional parsing context maltese case study reversing parser discussed efficiency issue looking back consumed input stream 
possible improvement mentioned passing reversing parser applying reversed past stream 
clearly parsers reversed 
access structure define partial parser reverse function 
lookback function reversed parser possible resulting efficient simple look backs 
optimisation optimisations possible access structure 
obvious example analysing grammar structure construct minimised automaton turns regular language 
language generation access structure grammar generate complete phrases opposed parsing 
constructed experimental phrase generator parsing combinators 
combining expose duality grammars means checking sentence correctness tools structure generate sentences 
mainly concerned dealing compositionally context particular emphasis natural language processing 
feel examples encouraging plan apply techniques non trivial portion maltese grammar assess real world effectiveness
