missing unit measurement 
solve problem current implementation provides generic support units fully intuitive way 
example user just write total area square miles unit denoted mi sq mile 
observe multiple identifiers denote unit different units measure quantity 
system offers support multiple unit identifiers 
growing number cases system provides automatic conversion value various units searches conducted values irrespective unit 
allows users state values square miles square kilometers 
user features completely transparent just enters unit choice

basic architecture semantic extensions mediawiki 
left wikipedia users edit articles enter semantic information see section 
extensions mediawiki data export external applications see section 
primary difficulty attributes proper recognition value 
attribute values currently just plain text adhere fixed format 
hand proper formatting complicated data value typed link 
link valid soon target exists data value number parsed find meaning 
formally distinguish value space set integer numbers lexical space set acceptable string representations integers 
similar conceptualisation encountered representation datatypes rdf xml schema xsd 
tempting build support attributes wikipedia original xsd datatypes 
certainly want xsd representations storing data values rdf triples 
unfortunately adopt lexical space xsd usually allow data representation common users especially language english 
allow users provide input values defined lexical space wikipedia usually equal lexical space xsd 
formally combine conversions data representations conversion wikipedia lexical space xsd value space conversion value space lexical space xsd 
lexical space wikipedia localised adapt writing customs languages xml schema representation universal allowing machine processing arbitrary language 
parsing user provided data values ensures stored rdf triples conform xml specification allows perform operations data described 
clearly prior knowledge lexical value spaces involved conversion general derived input 
words need predefined datatype attribute values 
note differs case typed links arbitrary identifiers introduced declaration 
section discuss system minimise formal constraints obstruct intuitive usage 
arrive system consists major components data values assigned attributes population associated datatype integer 
allow users declare datatype attribute introduce new wikipedia namespace attribute contains articles attributes 
articles provide human readable descriptions case relations categories add semantic information specifies datatype 
minimise amount new syntactic constructs propose concept typed links introduced 
reserve third namespace types type 
relation built semantic simply write hastype type integer denote attribute type 
declaration datatypes facilitated templates introduced section 
instance easily create template provides semantic information attribute type integer includes human readable hints descriptions 
types built articles serve give description proper usage admissible input values 
need arises conceive system customise types giving additional descriptions inside articles type namespace 
important understand type wikipedia implies xml schema datatype generally specific 
example types support xsd date mapping values different language specific lexical spaces wikipedia 
note general workflow processing attribute input slightly complex case typed links 
extracting attribute values article source need find datatype attribute 
requires additional reading request storage backend impact performance 
features template inclusion similar requirements optimistic impact tenable 
error handling contrast typed links handling attributes involves cases system able process input properly article syntactically correct 
case occurs users refer attributes datatype declared provided input values belong lexical space datatype 
usual way deal output error specifies problem user 
wiki environment vital tolerate errors possible 
reasons technical error messages repel contributors users may lack knowledge understanding handling error messages tolerating temporal errors inconsistencies crucial success collaborative editing 
system aims catching errors merely issuing warning messages possible 
case missing datatype declarations achieved presuming feasible datatype structure input 
basically encountering numerical value input treated floating point number 
processed string 
warning inside article bottom informs user possible problem 
exploit rdf includes datatype declaration value property 
property values multiple datatypes knowledge base 
required existing datatype declaration changed recall edit declarations 
new type affects edits articles existing data valid 
datatype specified input belong supported lexical space store semantic information restrict issuing warning message 
units measurement framework provides feasible architecture treating plain values number inhabitants city 
realistic quantities characterised numerical value associated unit 
major concern open community users may individual preferences regarding physical units 
units different systems vs miles different scales vs 
case reducing input mere number severely restricts comparability intended universal exchange data communities languages 
different attributes different units formally correct part problem remains values length miles length remain incomparable rdf tools 
solution problem twofold 
hand provide automatic unit conversion ensure large parts data stored unit 
hand recognise units conversion support implemented export way prevents confusion values different units 
note fairly easy separate unit string numerical value 
numerical value unit string unambiguously store information including unit information attribute property names 
example input length km exported value property identified length km 
users freely new units exported data remains machine processable 
power semantic annotation stems comparing attributes database desirable employ small number different units 
users achieve manually converting values standard unit giving units optional alternative texts 
automate process providing built unit conversion common units 
rdf output possible tell unit conversion taken place automatically user provided value unit right away 
advantage safely add unit support gradually affecting applications exported data 
built unit support allows provide automatic conversions inside article text provides immediate gratification attributes 
formally added unit support extends lexical space wikipedia datatypes requiring complex parsing functions 
consequently unit information provided datatype 
restrict primitive types integer decimal may complex types temperature distance note unit enabled types account differences scale feasible convert length light years metres intends support arbitrary precision numbers
