challenges internet research data quality internet expand research opportunities raises concerns data quality generalizability 
sample biases research internet samples generalize 
psychologists value internal validity generalizability large diverse samples online preferable college psychological theory rests 
sociologists political scientists attempt track pulse nation generalize broader groups subjects nature internet samples generalizability problematic robinson smith 
random digit dialing telephone numbers approximates random sample population sampling frame currently exists provides random sample internet users 
generalizing internet samples larger population especially problematic 
large demographic differences internet users existed diminished populations differ demographic social psychological dimensions robinson 
example internet users white young children nation department commerce 
internet samples potentially biased bias arises self selection dropout 
response rates online surveys typically lower comparable mail telephone surveys choice internet questionnaires respondents overwhelmingly choose schonlau 
problem biased sample selection especially problematic longitudinal data collection 
surveys example difficult maintain contact internet respondents contacted telephone mail mail addresses change frequently phone numbers postal addresses 
increase response rates researchers willing switch alternate modes contact panel 
reduce biases result drop researchers consider adjustment strategies weighting multiple imputation methods data analysis rubin 
control data collection setting conducting surveys experiments online researchers lose control environment research conducted 
laboratory example experimenter verify subjects identities age gender tailor instructions subject monitor behavior ensure involved serious assess effect research experience intervene researcher perceives undesirable effects 
researcher decides collect data online monitoring control difficult impossible 
difficulties monitoring intervening online data collection encourage researchers pretest instructions manipulations data collection instruments thoroughly laboratory settings 
anonymous nature internet allows people participate malicious intent 
involve multiple submissions individual widespread dissemination uniform resource locator url purposes flooding site behaviors designed undermine integrity research 
distortions deliberate online subjects may simply invest time energy research task involved telephone survey laboratory experiment 
example williams colleagues williams cheung choi williams reported substantially higher dropout rates conducting online experiments observed conducting similar research laboratory 
online research may require larger samples comparable telephone laboratory research compensate greater error introduced research subjects diligent 
inviting known individuals assigned unique identifiers participate online research tracking internet protocol ip addresses help guard multiple submissions

king quoted member online support group wrote going participate actively researcher presence group joined thought support group bunch guinea pigs see till similar concerns 
conducting cost benefit analysis research investigators alike consider subtle consequences decisions 
debriefing american psychological association ethical guidelines call debriefing subjects providing explanation nature results research soon participation practical 
deception involved researcher needs explain value research results deception necessary 
investigators aware debriefing research procedures caused harm subject take steps ameliorate harm 
conducting research online researchers post debriefing materials web site automatically update material new results available tailor debriefing materials particular experimental conditions individual subjects

absence researcher online setting difficult assess subject state determine individual upset experimental procedure understands feedback received 
breach confidentiality believe greater risk harm online research comes possible disclosure identifiable private information outside research context experience participating research 
identifying information include records statements attitudes behaviors coupled names mail addresses partially disguised pseudonyms identifying information 
researchers ensure adequate provisions protect privacy subjects maintain confidentiality data 
identifying information may inadvertently disclosed data collected commonly stored networked computer connected public internet 
data transit vulnerable example subject automated process sends data investigator mail 
store forward nature mail means message may rest temporary directories intervening computers delivered addressee 
danger data collected automated web surveys sniffing programs eavesdrop data transit search known patterns social security numbers credit card numbers mail addresses 
risks avoided collecting identifying information separating data research data 
analogous risks occur forms higher data shipped internet openness networks possibility automated pattern detection 
greater risks confidentiality result outsiders gaining access stored data files deliberate hacking researchers mistakenly distributed 
risk unique online research challenge data stored networked computers 
standard approach dealing problems confidentiality separate personal identifiers data describing subjects 
keep identifying information names addresses file data second arbitrary code number link 
steiger illustrated techniques maintain separation identity data survey research involving sensitive data 
maintaining confidentiality data stored computer systems may require psychologists sophisticated computer technology february march american psychologist currently 
researchers configure computers need know access directories containing research data regularly check permissions 
routinely keep security alerts issued vendors apply security updates released 
sensitive data directories password protected sensitive files encrypted 
investigators fail take precautions protect data 
special complication maintaining subject anonymity arises investigator conducting online research match different pieces information respondent 
example hypertext markup language html protocol web surveys authored keep history page view link responses single respondent 
variety ways keep track respondent answers web pages compromising anonymity session cookies stored memory hidden values embedded html environment variables ip address 
paying online subjects participation may link subjects responses identities sending payment requires mailing address accounting regulations require social security number 
researchers severed link buying gift certificates online retailers amazon com displaying unique certificate number respondent completion questionnaire 
subjects certificates revealing identity 
degree concern confidentiality steps taken ensure directly related sensitivity data collected 
concerned subjects anonymous information innocuous revelation bring harm embarrassment subjects 
online surveys experiments fall categories 
cases passwords encryption strong assurance research subjects needed may harm research 
example singer schwarz demonstrated overly elaborate assurances confidentiality may diminish respondents concern causing subjects willing provide sensitive information 
strong security measures secure socket layer protocols may prohibit research subjects participating 
subjects identifiable research involves data place risk criminal civil liability damage financial standing reputation investigators especially concerned breaches confidentiality 
circumstances standard security measures place electronic commerce encryption secure protocols sufficient 
numerous tutorials outline options garfinkel spafford russell 
february march american psychologist informed consent investigators typically obtain document voluntary informed consent research subjects subjects freely agree participate understand research involves risks benefits 
federal human subjects regulation requires informed consent documented written consent form approved irb signed subject 
difficult obtain legally binding signatures online 
requirements written documentation informed consent minimal risk research research require informed consent outside research context documentation link research data subject identity 
case online research involving adults conditions documentation informed consent met recommend document allow procedure subjects click button online form indicate read understood consent form 
indicated earlier lack interactivity online research means investigator tell subject understood informed consent statement 
result online research may require statements research conducted venues 
researchers increase likelihood subjects granting truly informed consent requiring feedback subjects level understanding example requiring click accept element informed consent statement administering short establish subject understood 
efforts protect confidentiality extra efforts ensure informed consent may reduce response rates increase sensitive items singer possibly produce biased data 
techniques recommended research involving minimal risk subject 
simple procedures research involving competent adults may appropriate online research involving children vulnerable groups mentally handicapped 
federal regulation populations empowered give consent 
parent guardian consent child may optionally asked 
inability establish subjects identity especially problematic researchers easily determine online subjects revealing true age children easily pretend parents 
researchers institute procedures reliably distinguish children adults having subjects enter information generally available adults credit card numbers requiring register trusted authority www com products 
depending risk involved researcher irb accept possibility unidentified minors participated research forged parental consent insist legally verified signature accompany consent form conducting research offline 
note researchers working children online subject human subjects regulations children online privacy protection act see www gov htm 
researchers prohibited collecting personal information child posting notices information getting verifiable parental consent 
advice researchers institutional review boards conducting research online offers great opportunities psychological research researchers embrace way conducting empirical research protecting data quality rights human subjects 
general research internet inherently difficult conduct inherently subjects traditional research styles 
internet relatively new medium conducting research raises ambiguities long settled conventional laboratory field settings

investigators reduce fraudulent data tracking ip addresses putting cookies subjects computers tracking sign ons invited participate 
improve validity data experiments surveys programming input forms check anomalous values suspicious patterns data exploratory data analysis understand data analyzing inferential statistics 
keep quality pollute pool economies ease access internet attractive research medium pose dilemma commons hardin olson 
quality control imposed granting agencies supervise subject pools easy unqualified researchers contaminate large numbers potential research subjects 
low quality academic research conducted online having consequences similar commercial mail ability legitimate researchers collect data online 
researchers restrain supervise students contact minimal number potential subjects appropriate research goals 
pilot pretest research online new researchers get direct feedback subjects settings pretest informed consent forms manipulations measures wide range people 
researchers run surveys experiments online recommend starting small pilot projects identify online data collection methods differ conventional ones 

example recommended pilot project explicitly attempt replicate phenomenon known offline setting 
comparability subject behavior established new variables addressed greater confidence 
distinguish public private behavior online unrestricted mail distribution lists online chat rooms multiplayer games provide opportunities observe behaviors public behaviors seen city streets parks 
case research involving minimal risks observations considered preexisting records public behavior exempt common rule regulations requiring administrative review irb 
research involving online behavior clear cut may pose subtle ethical dilemmas surrounding observation conventional public places
