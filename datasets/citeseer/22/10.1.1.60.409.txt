ontowiki idea ontologies varying degree expressivity ranging flat collections consensual concepts axiomatized models 
ontologies subsumption hierarchy allows infer implicit class membership mandatory property 
expressive form ontology collection named concepts natural language definition meaning controlled vocabulary 
expressive ontologies support sophisticated reasoning flat ontologies useful 
having unique identifiers uris assigned concepts described natural language beneficial 
observe hand real ontologies available large share ontologies published web outdated dead collections created academic research context 
hand english version wikipedia contains entries means holds unique identifiers concepts 
basic idea wiki mechanism community create uri needed concept describe concept natural language refine modify definition link approach wealth concepts defined wikipedia 
main paradigm simplicity want support functionality productively large share community 

research challenges wiki technology ontology engineering see research challenges 
selection proper ontology meta model define ontology meta model suitable large audience 
current approach support classes instances relationships sense rdf predicates 
relationships data type properties pointing literal values standard xsd data types object properties point instance class 
sense model close plain rdf 
point time completely leave kind hierarchical order 
handling conceptual change standard wiki provides functionality necessary create textual definition unique uri 
example anybody added entry republic austria wikipedia available en wikipedia org wiki austria 
immediately mechanism propose re uri resource locator retrieval description identifier concept republic austria 
problem everybody alter text know current version monotonic extension previous version 
anybody uri annotation instances statement find statement longer holds modified version 
propose hands solution combination history functionality mediawiki distribution versioning scheme embedded uri concepts documents wsmo wsml working groups 
main idea general uri en wikipedia org wiki austria refers latest version intermediate versions additional uri adding date time creation plus probably ip address originator 
mediawiki wikipedia intermediate versions unique identifiers 
allows referring latest version specific version 
possible create statements specific version 
helper functionality collaborative ontology building success wikis impossible existence small effective scripts help community build maintain corpus knowledge 
currently evaluating various helper scripts ontowiki 
partitioning communities conflicting views subject communities similar terms different concepts helpful partition space wiki entries subspaces 
currently implementing allowing user propose new ontology works subdirectory reflected uri concepts 
obviously preliminary list research challenges striving comprehensive understanding associated problems 

discussion proposed standard wiki technology platform community driven ontology building maintenance 
current stage provides support creating uris plus human readable definitions text graphics classes instances relationships 
provide reasoning support offers opportunity large user community establish unique identifiers needed concepts current complete ontologies
