explore online prosodic analysis aim bringing human interaction control capabilities conversational computers 
specifically look prosodic phenomena liable relevant interaction control silent pauses intonation patterns 
worth noting primary goal create natural human spoken dialogue systems human computer conversation experiments provide evidence counter evidence relationship interaction control phenomena prosodic manifestations 
prosodic phenomena interaction control previous suggests number prosodic phonetic cues associated turn yielding potentially relevant interaction control 
cues include phenomena silent pauses various intonation patterns rises falls steps decreases speech rate final lengthening intensity patterns centralized vowel quality voice quality 
note rises falls associated turn yielding 
cues typically located turn necessarily final syllable ford thompson local kelly local local ogden wells 
similarly studies suggesting certain prosodic phonetic cues associated turn keeping cues course potentially relevant interaction control 
include phenomena glottal vocal tract stops audible release different quality silent pauses result glottal vocal tract closures assimilation silent pause held articulations lengthened vowels nasals fricatives local kelly ogden 
certain intonation patterns associated turn keeping 
particular level intonation patterns middle speakers fundamental frequency range observed act turn keeping cues different languages 
example duncan reported pattern level tone speaker mid register pattern smith prosodic transcription scheme smith signals english 
mid level pattern acts turn keeping signal duncan term 
similarly reported level pitch accents pause signal turn holding turn keeping german ichikawa den observed flat flat fall rise fall intonation patterns tended occur speaker holds turn keeping japanese study japanese conversations den reported flat intonation pause bounded phrases acts inhibitory cue backchannels 
furthermore study final pitch accents boundary tones turn system dutch identified intonation patterns associated turn keeping accent lending rise followed level high pitch bridging syntactic breaks utterances filled pause mid level boundary tone bridging syntactic constituents

observations rely full access knowledge trained interactional linguists

order capture cues accurate classification metrically heavy light syllables accented non accented words required

consequently may possible mentioned cues online automatic systems

silent pauses frequently chunking speech stream manageable units speech technology applications 
utterance detectors current automatic speech recognition typically rely exclusively silence threshold ms sic 
delimiting units recognised cf
