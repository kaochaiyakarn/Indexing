learning knowledge management paradigms knowledge management knowledge management discipline originating management studies going hand hand information technologies reason necessity technical solution implementation 
knowledge management takes organizational perspective learning main problem tries address lack sharing knowledge members organization 
solutions try enable encourage individuals making explicit knowledge creating knowledge assets engaging discussion fora 
language knowledge management degree naive assumes knowledge tangible produced captured transferred summed corporate memory 
starting metadata driven document management knowledge management adopted communication collaboration solutions order address problem tacit knowledge 
knowledge management fully realize mainly facilitating purpose oriented learning organizations understanding learning takes place extremely important consider 
learning view modern constructivist learning theories just transferring knowledge highly individualized task construction 
learning learning better computer supported learning focuses individual acquisition construction new knowledge technological means support construction process 
main assumptions learning coming pedagogy learning needs improved guidance 
typical form guidance teacher tutor organizing learning process 
elearning transferred concept lessons computer courses consisting learning resources connected meaningful way 
comes pedagogical insight matters efficiency learning order learning resources offered encompass traditional courses modular learning objects elusive interaction possibilities 
concept guidance leads asymmetry separation roles author tutor learner 
authors tutors trained persons learners typically 
state art learning approaches provide sophisticated ideas improving learning process 
focus founded learning material rich media content complex interaction profiles impractical especially cost sensitive corporate settings 
true clear approach rich learning programs facilitate learning individual significantly learning approaches far able solve problem producing kind materials 
simulations close real world perfect answer constructivist learning theories demanding situated learning high degree engagement learner 
real world companies looks different 
advanced courses bought external training providers 
majority learning occurs perfect things authored peer peer manner provide significant opportunities learn 
especially true innovative topics constituted mature knowledge consolidated view highly specialized subjects
