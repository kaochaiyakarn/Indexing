medical search unique requirements distinguish traditional web search 
existing medical search engines fully addressed unique requirements completely fulfill medical information searchers needs 
existing medical search engines assume searchers form appropriate queries 
internet users medical knowledge 
frequently medical information searcher vague idea problem facing know proper way clearly describe situation sufficient detail 
result appropriate guidance highly necessary medical search process 
illustrated analogy medical diagnosis process 
doctor office visit important purpose conversation doctor patient doctor guide patient collect useful information patient situation 
doctor asks sequence proper questions content question answers patient gives previous questions 
doctor uses collected information perform differential diagnosis 
deciding diseases patient having presence absence certain symptoms provide important clues accompanied 
existing web search engine technologies mainly keyword matching 
searcher easily describe absence symptom sy way utilized existing web search engines 
example web pages describing diseases sy mention sy explicitly different ways mention sy 
web page describing disease presence absence keywords sy directly criterion deciding sy 
difficult medical information searcher obtain useful search results purely traditional keyword search 
partially address aforementioned problems major medical search engine added symptom search functionality feb 
searcher selects symptoms symptom list additional keywords allowed returns list diseases symptoms 
symptom search helpful addresses aforementioned problems limited way 
diseases symptom correct way distinguish diseases features sex age race patient occupation remaining symptoms symptom list 
extremely difficult timeconsuming searcher distinguish diseases checking detailed descriptions 
example mentioned collins diseases cause abdominal 
distinguish diseases location properties symptoms 
second symptom search express absence certain symptoms significantly reduce length list possible diseases 
third symptom search disallows searcher inputting useful keywords identifying possible diseases exam results existing diseases foods beverages patient taken 
fourth patient symptoms simultaneously due presence multiple diseases 
symptom search find diseases symptoms diseases completely different ones patient having 
worse returned disease set multiple symptoms empty 
imed prototype intelligent medical web search engine addresses aforementioned limitations existing systems
