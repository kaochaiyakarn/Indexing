contribution deals problems solutions finding procedures labeling multimodal data corpus created smartkom project goal smartkom project development intelligent computer user interface allow natural communication adaptive self explanatory machine 
system accept input form natural speech form gestures 
additionally facial expression prosody speech analyzed 
train recognizers explore users interact system data collected called wizard oz experiments 
speech gestures user states labeled 
start project speech transliteration conventions existed 
conventions procedures label video data newly created 
contribution describe development process user state labeling conventions example strategy functional labeling 
development structure gesture labeling described detail

labels refer functional level morphological level 
theoretical reasons want functional coding system see

information smartkom see evaluation multimodal dialogue systems transfer established methods 
project planned label emotions users

information user state labels user state labeling procedures data collection smartkom main conference 
gesture coding system defines hand gestures functionally morphologically 
labeled unit coded regard intention user regard assumed discrete goal 
functional code functional unit defined differently different authors 
term accordance fa unit defined regard effect context 

labels selective 
functional codes indirect measurements exact direct methods exceptional care taken find labels defined easy observe unproblematic discriminate means objective communicable criteria 
true user states gestures communicable criteria discrimination functional user state categories hard find 

coding system fast easy 

resulting label file facilitate automatic processing consistent file structure consistent coding non ambiguous symbols ascii preferably easy read 

main categories modifiers realized codes annotations order consistency 
annotations free comments descriptions don follow strict rule flexible codes predefined labels fixed set increase conformity labelers

third step finding features categories assigned subjective impression labelers 
goal find detectable features 
additionally categories describable observable criteria apart labelers able understand content labels

fourth step overcoming limitations practical criteria adopted transliteration conventions speech smartkom see 
holistic labeling system relatively sure catch relevant user state episodes sort selective categories

additionally combining holistic labeling labeling facial expression formal system speech disadvantages purely holistic functional coding system 
comparing different label files possible analyze process data different points view looking parts 
traditional way annotating input modalities separately comparisons possible 
labeling data multimodal systems allows new ways studying human machine interaction
