faceted browsing information space partitioned orthogonal conceptual dimensions data 
dimensions called facets represent important characteristics information elements 
facet multiple restriction values user selects restriction value constrain relevant items information space 
facet theory directly mapped navigation semi structured rdf data information elements rdf subjects facets rdf predicates restriction values rdf objects 
collection art works example facets type time periods artist names geographical locations 
users able constrain facet restriction value created th century limit visible collection subset 
step step restrictions applied constrain information space 
faceted interface advantages keyword search explicit queries allows exploration unknown dataset system suggests restriction values step visual interface removing need write explicit queries prevents dead queries offering restriction values lead empty results

section develop technique 
automatically construct facets need understand characteristics constitute suitable facet 
facet represent important characteristic classified entity context predicates 
need find predicates best represent dataset best descriptors efficiently navigate dataset best navigators 
section introduce facet ranking metrics

faceted browsing decision tree traversal suitable facet allows efficient navigation dataset 
faceted browsing considered simultaneously constructing traversing decision tree branches represent predicates nodes represent restriction values 
example fig 
shows tree browsing collection publications constraining author year topic 
facets orthogonal applied order constrain year topic publication select author shown fig 

path tree represents set constraints select resources interest 
tree constructed dynamically available restriction values topic different trees fig

facet metrics regarding faceted browsing constructing traversing decision tree helps select facets allow efficient navigation tree 
section define navigation quality facet terms measurable properties metrics dataset 
metrics range combine final score weighted multiplication 
scale facets rank allowing highlighting disturbing alphabetical order metrics need recomputed step decision tree information space changes shrinks decision step 
give examples metric sample citeseer dataset scientific publications citations example metrics apply top level root decision tree 
rank facets navigational value descriptive value way 
result metrics indication usefulness badly ranked facets disappear completely inefficient intuitive 
predicate balance tree navigation efficient tree branching decision optimises decision power 
balance predicate indicate navigation efficiency 
example see table institution label balanced publication type rounded normalised balance 
table shows detail type publications unbalanced different types publications occur frequently proceeding papers miscellaneous journal articles rest publication types occur rarely 
relatively unbalanced predicate constraining publication type economic decision 
compute predicate balance balance normalised variance number subjects ns oi select oi object value oi balance var ns oi ns var ns oi ns object cardinality suitable predicate limited higher amount object values choose 
choices options difficult display choice confuse user 
example shown table predicate type usable object values choose predicate author title directly usable different values 
solution reducing object cardinality object clustering outside scope 
font scaling implemented 
www csd ac uk php citeseer ist psu edu normalisation linear balance decreases quickly compared variance better normalisation 
compute object cardinality metric card number different objects restriction values predicate normalise function gaussian density 
displaying usability purposes number different options approximately regulated parameters 
card exp predicate frequency suitable predicate occurs frequently inside collection distinct resources covered predicate useful dividing information space 
predicate occurs infrequently selecting restriction value predicate affect small subset resources
