mobility primer important lessons learnt knowledge gained assisting visually impaired travellers real world situations 
knowledge applied visually impaired sighted web travellers 
travel thought experience moving place regardless destination known start travel journey initially 
travelling involves orientation environment purpose mobility defined ability move freely easily confidently travelling 
context successful journey desired location easily reached 
conventionally travel mobility separated aspects navigation orientation 
orientation thought knowledge basic spatial relationships objects environment
