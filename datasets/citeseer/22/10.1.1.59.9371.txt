im set distinct attributes transaction contains set items database different transaction records ts 
association rule implication form sets items called itemsets 
called antecedent called consequent rule means implies important basic measures association rules support confidence 
database large users concern frequently purchased items usually thresholds support confidence predefined users drop rules interesting useful 
thresholds called minimal support minimal confidence respectively additional constraints interesting rules specified users 
basic parameters association rule mining arm support confidence 
support association rule defined percentage fraction records contain total number records database 
count item increased time item encountered different transaction database scanning process 
means support count take quantity item account 
example transaction customer buys bottles increase support count number beer word transaction contains item support count item increased 
support calculated technical report cais nanyang technological university singapore 
formula support xy association rule mining survey support count xy otal number transaction definition see support item statistical significance association rule 
suppose support item means percent transaction contain purchasing item 
retailer pay attention kind items bought frequently obviously high support desired interesting association rules
