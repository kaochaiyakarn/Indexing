limitations adopting approach 
task hot bursty event detection find minimal set features represent bursty event 
document pivot clustering approach features need considered measure similarity documents 
similarity documents biased noisy features 
early study reported similar documents belong different categories 
document pivot clustering approach simi document clustering lar documents necessarily report event 
document pivot clustering approach tf idf schema feature weightings 
tf idf schema originally designed information retrieval clustering performs text clustering problems 
tf idf schema variations basic idea features appear documents useful assigned higher weights 
tf idf schema suit purposes hot bursty events detection need find features appear large number documents certain hot periods distinguish set documents contain burst features documents 
document pivot clustering approach effective handling cases events occurs bursts times long time period 
reason event broken parts specific features occur frequently consecutive time windows 
illustrates example 
suppose consecutive documents documents support event document clustering suppose documents initially grouped cluster documents initially grouped cluster 
recall threshold stopping criterion maintain high intra similarity cluster prohibits documents related cluster assigned 
result may able merge form single cluster 
words long running event may broken separated events different clusters 
may result small clusters difficult find major events lasts long 
assume document pivot clustering ap proach cluster documents events 
difficult determine bursty events requires ranking function rank events 
prior knowledge difficult formulate ranking function 
addition difficult determine hot periods 
threshold may need introduced determine hot periods hot period defined number documents belong bursty event specific time period larger predefined threshold 
exist single threshold different events
