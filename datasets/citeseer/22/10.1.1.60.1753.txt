association maintenance correctness scheme relies correct association knowledge 
node needs know id lower association node know pairwise key verify pairwise mac 
addition needs know id upper association node add valid pairwise mac report upper association node drop report 
path base station cluster head static initial association discovery process necessary 
path base station cluster head changes due failure intermediate node reasons scheme adapt change accordingly maintain correct associations 
discuss associa tion maintenance scenarios base station initiated repair local repair 

base station initiated repair scenario path formed reports cluster head base station follow path path changed due base station 
example tinyos beaconing protocol base station broadcasts beaconing message periodically forming breadth tree rooted base station :10.1.1.117.697
specifically node records parent node node receives beaconing message current epoch rebroadcasts beaconing message 
path cluster head base station changed intermediate node chooses different parent nodes consecutive time epochs 
adapt path changes scheme execute base station hello step epoch piggybacking node ids beaconing message 
cluster acknowledgment process omitted letting lower association node enclose id pairwise mac forwards report 
strategy works networks topology changes frequently additional bandwidth expense ids beaconing message 
dynamic networks overhead reduced 
especially path change different epochs necessary node attach id beaconing message 
adopt reactive approach association maintenance relatively static networks 
recall base station hello step node records ids ids nodes path base station 
node hops away base station actual number hops base station 
node infer upstream nodes unchanged receives beaconing message parent node beaconing message original format node ids added node forwards original beaconing message upstream nodes unchanged 
see path unchanged different epochs scheme incur additional bandwidth overhead 
node selects parent node different ch previous epoch sends request new parent node get ids upstream nodes attaches node ids id beaconing message forwarding 

local repair base station initiated repair scheme underlying routing protocol large beaconing period failure intermediate node path may cause reports dropped 
necessary nodes detecting failure neighbor locally repair path avoids failed node 
result inconsistent node association relationship scheme 
need scheme locally repair association relationship adaptively 
approach local repair right hand rule greedy parameter stateless routing gpsr protocol 
assume node knows locations relative locations neighbors gps 
fig 
illustrates approach 
node detects parent node failed issue node failure detection scope sends repair message node counterclockwise edge 
repair message includes ids upstream nodes includes id list 
forward repair message rule 
receives message finds node rule list means failed node bypassed 
requests id list includes ids upstream nodes node 
node forwards list downstream nodes way base station hello step 
node associations changed association relationship proactively 
note local repair process necessary maintain path connectivity important limit frequency process invoked 
compromised node may invoke process frequently consume energy involved nodes 
thwart attack instance limit number invocations beaconing epoch

case false report dropped forwarded nodes 
note upper bound corresponds worst case adversary compromise nodes selectively achieve upper bound 
enhancements basic scheme worst case compromised nodes collude deceive nodes drawn assumption node checks id list includes distinct ids 
reduce upper bound adding constraints easy implement practice 
exploit fact scheme node knows authenticated neighbor set 
enroute node receives id list acknowledgment message downstream node additionally checks downstream node list scheme node adds id id list 
consider block worst case 
constraint cluster head ch place ch list second id list sends false list

furthermore simply adding id list node add id pair includes id id lower association 
consider block 
list ch sends includes say lower association node 
node adds id lower association node list node see pair list 
neighbor knows lower association node downstream nodes 
avoid detected adversary include list block 
similarly adversary include id compromised nodes list blocks 
achieve upper bound 
second scheme add node feedback mechanism facilitate compromise detection 
example node receives certain number false data packets send alert report base station 
alert report contains information id node node received false data 
base station take necessary actions traceback identify compromised node 
traceback possible scheme packet authenticated transmission compromised node localized see section details 
compromised node may drop alert report going force nodes base station 
avoid detected false data injection compromised node closest base station need drop false data injected colluding compromised node 
consider worst case scenario 
node xt need drop false data injected coalition 
adversary mount false data injection attacks consume energy relaying nodes ch xt known base station 
adversary wants achieve goal deceive nodes relay false data 
example upper bound upper bound 
third sensor nodes possess gps devices scheme reduce upper bound greatly expense larger performance overhead 
idea embed location node id compromised node lie location 
scheme security assumption sensor node compromised obtains coordinate gps deployment 
assumption adapt instance blundo scheme way 
key server pre loads node bivariate polynomial degree original scheme 
deployment node generates new id combines id coordinate simply concatenating hashing concatenation shorter id 
node evaluates erases 
compromised reveal information polynomials nodes possess 
nodes want establish pairwise key provide authentic information locations 
coordinates default transmission range know minimum number hops 
furthermore base station broadcasts coordinate node know roughly direction path located 
result adversary compromised node located node base station hops away node lower association node compromised node normally deceive node upper bound slightly larger note variation effective preventing false data injection attacks consider upper bound scheme mainly due performance considerations
