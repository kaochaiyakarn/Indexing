lbns explicitly distinguish deterministic logical knowledge probabilistic knowledge 
lbns disjoint sets predicates set logical predicates set probabilistic predicates idea introduced ngo haddawy 
logical predicates specify logical background knowledge describing domain discourse world considered supposed deterministic information 
probabilistic predicates lbns lbns relation probabilistic logical models predicates bayesian logic programs associated range represent random variables 
precisely random variable represented ground atom built probabilistic predicate range equal range predicate 
note debatable predicates right name predicates behave typed functors ordinary predicates similarly logical atoms behave terms ordinary atoms 
main reason calling predicates stay line terminology bayesian logic programs introduced lbns variant bayesian logic programs believe important 
lbns components 
set clauses called random variable declarations 
second set clauses called conditional dependency clauses 
third set logical conditional probability distributions logical cpds quantifying conditional dependencies determined conditional dependency clauses 
fourth set normal logic clauses logical predicates specify deterministic background information
