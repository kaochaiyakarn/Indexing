networks ooo may happen multiple times route changes 
ooo ordering information added tcp acks tcp data packets 
ooo detection carried ends sender detects order ack packets receiver detects order data packets 
receiver detects ooo notify sender sender initiates congestion control actions 
tcp sender knows ooo condition responsive actions temporarily disabling congestion control instant recovery congestion avoidance 
action means ooo condition detected tcp sender keep state variables rto congestion window size constant time period action means past time period entered state congestion avoidance recover immediately state prior congestion avoidance
