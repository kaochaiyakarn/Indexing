challenge ambiguity ubicomp systems typically sensing systems 
bellotti discuss article making sense sensing systems lead serious usability problems 
research remains done identifying best user interface mechanisms dealing sensing issues ambiguity errors 
best done conjunction evaluation techniques tools capable helping judge 
case studies show ambiguity errors serious important issues determining system success understanding usability problems 
ubicomp systems depend recognition recommendations machine learning ambiguity prone components evaluation techniques need provide feedback acceptable levels accuracy

challenge unobtrusiveness case studies evaluation techniques failed appropriately handle integration daily lives 
challenge arose ways

deployment occurs experience shows recruiting local champion strategy increased success 
strategy involves application participatory design 
lastly constant adaptation appears necessary deployment success especially difficulty getting complete feedback deployment means systems highly refined deployed
