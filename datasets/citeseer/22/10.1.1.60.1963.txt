low incentive providing rating ratings typically provided transaction taken place transaction partners usually direct incentive providing rating party 
example service provider capacity limited participants may want share resource want give referrals 
example buyers negative ratings nice fear retaliation seller 
specific motives rater benefit directly providing rating 
serves community provide ratings potential free riding letting provide ratings exists 
despite fact provide ratings 
study resnick zeckhauser buyers sellers ebay provided rating 
possible explanations relatively high values example providing reciprocal ratings simply expression 
lack incentives providing ratings general problem needs special attention require specific incentive mechanisms 
miller 
proposed scheme eliciting honest feedback financial rewards 
faltings proposed similar incentive scheme providing truthful ratings payments 
bias positive rating positive bias ratings provided 
resnick zeckhauser ratings provided buyers ratings provided sellers negative low reflect reality 
possible explanations positive rating bias positive ratings simply represents exchange resnick zeckhauser positive ratings hope getting positive rating return chen singh alternatively negative ratings avoided fear retaliation party resnick zeckhauser 
unfairly positive rating unfairly negative ratings certainly potential provoking retaliation law suit 
obvious method avoiding positive bias consist providing anonymous reviews 
cryptographic scheme anonymous ratings proposed ismail 

unfair ratings finding ways avoid reduce influence unfairly positive unfairly negative ratings fundamental problem reputation systems ratings taken account 
relying party control ratings provided subjective basis 
authors proposing methods counter problem include 
methods avoiding bias unfair ratings broadly grouped categories described 
endogenous discounting unfair ratings category covers methods exclude give low weight presumed unfair ratings analysing comparing rating values 
assumption unfair ratings recognised statistical properties 
dellarocas proposed different schemes detecting excluding ratings unfair judged statistical analysis 
chen singh proposed scheme uses elements collaborative filtering grouping raters ratings give objects 
exogenous discounting unfair ratings category covers methods externally determined reputation rater determine weight ratings 
assumption raters low reputation give unfair ratings vice versa 
private information resulting personal experience normally considered reliable public information ratings third parties 
relying party private information information compared public information order give indication reliability public information 
buchegger le boudec proposed scheme bayesian reputation engine deviation test classify raters trustworthy trustworthy 

described reputation scheme top gnutella network 
bj proposed scheme built prototype called rating architecture engineering construction aec industry 
yu singh proposed variant weighted majority algorithm determine weights rater 
change identities reputation systems assumption identities pseudonyms long lived allowing ratings particular party past related party 
case party suffered significant loss reputation interest change identity pseudonym order cut past start fresh 
practice general interest community prevented discouraged 
authors proposing methods counter practice include moukas maes 
reputation scheme call scheme mit kasbah multi agent transaction system 
completion transaction parties able rate party behaved 
kasbah agents resulting reputation score negotiating transactions 
main goal design scheme discourage users changing identities scheme deliberately designed penalise newcomers 
approach disadvantage difficult distinguish bad newcomers 
quality variations time economic theory indicates balance cost establishing reputation financial benefit having reputation leading equilibrium 
variations quality services goods result deliberate management decisions uncontrolled factors cause changes quality necessarily lead variations reputation 
theoretic equilibrium exists fluctuations possible characterise conditions oscillations avoided converge equilibrium 
particular discounting past shown condition convergence equilibrium 
discounting past implemented various ways authors different names describe basically thing 
past ratings discounted forgetting factor aging factor fading factor 
inversely longevity factor determine rating time live 
way www gnutella com describe reinforcement learning 
discounting past function time frequency transactions combination 
discrimination discriminatory behaviour occur providing services providing ratings 
seller example provide quality buyers single buyer 
ratings particular seller indicate trustworthy expect ratings buyer victim 
filtering techniques described sec give false positives judge buyer victim unfair situations 
systems able recognise buyer victim trustworthy give weight ratings able handle situation 
techniques described sec theoretically able protect type discrimination simulations done prove 
discrimination take form single rater giving fair ratings dealing specific partner 
filtering techniques described sec sec designed handle type discrimination 
ballot box ballot means legitimate number ratings provided 
problem closely related unfair ratings ballot usually consists unfair ratings 
traditional voting schemes political elections ballot means votes cast favour candidate online reputation systems ballot happen negative votes 
common problem online reputation systems described sec usually poor protection 
commercial live reputation systems ebay feedback forum provide adequate protection ballot ratings provided transactions completion 
ebay charges fee transaction ballot expensive 
epinions slashdot reputation system provides degree protection registered members vote controlled way merit reviews comments 
discussion purpose describe analyse state art trust reputation systems 
dingledine proposed set basic criteria judging quality soundness reputation computation engines 

accuracy long term performance 
system reflect confidence score 
capability distinguish new entity unknown quality entity poor long term performance 

weighting current behaviour 
system recognise reflect trends entity performance 
example entity behaved long time suddenly goes downhill quickly recognised untrustworthy 

robustness attacks 
system resist attempts entities manipulate reputation scores 

smoothness 
adding single rating influence score significantly 
criteria easily satisfied reputation engines primitive rating score sum positive minus negative ratings feedback forum 
criterion hand probably solved completely new unforeseen attacks solutions 
problems unfair ratings ballot probably hardest solve reputation system subjective ratings participants large number researchers working academic community 
having solution works situations multiple techniques advantages disadvantages trade offs 
lack incentives provide ratings fundamental problem rational reason providing feedback 
commercial online reputation systems take ratings users account financial incentives provided epinions hard cash price discount web sites provide immaterial incentives form status rank 
reputation systems commercial online applications serious vulnerabilities obvious reliability systems questionable 
assuming reputation systems give unreliable scores 
possible answer question situations reputation systems need robust value lies 
resnick zeckhauser consider explanations relation reputation system reputation system robust serve purpose providing incentive behaviour participants think works system statistical normative sense may function successfully swiftly reacts bad behaviour called imposes costs participant get established called label initiation dues 
online reputation systems far robust obvious organisations run business model relatively insensitive robustness 
reputation system serves kind social network attract people web site case having simple rules participating important having strict rules controlling participants behaviour 
reputation system user participation depend people respond designed mind 
explanation business perspective having reputation system robust desirable generally gives positive bias 
commercial web stores business selling positively biased ratings promote sales negative ratings 
robustness reputation system crucial organisation runs take measures protect stability system robustness attacks 
example including routine manual control part scheme epinions case selecting category lead reviewers slashdot case slashdot staff omnipotent moderators 
exceptional manual control probably needed system come heavy attack 
important element keep exact details computation algorithm system implemented confidential called security obscurity case epinions slashdot google 
ratings usually subjective judgement opens box unfair ratings ratings objective criteria simpler achieve high robustness 
trust reputation schemes study cover wide range application different types mechanisms single solution suitable contexts applications 
designing implementing new systems necessary consider constraints type information input ratings 
rich literature growing trust reputation systems internet transactions implementation reputation systems successful commercial application give strong indication important technology 
commercial live implementation settled relatively simple schemes multitude different systems advanced features proposed academic community 
general observation proposals academic community far lack coherence 
systems proposed usually designed scratch cases authors building proposals authors 
period seen period pioneers hope near bring consolidation set sound recognised principles building trust reputation systems find way practical commercial applications
