interface wiksar prototype 
semantic wiki features wiksar interface consists wiki page optional interactive graph visualisation switched separate frame 
wiki page wiksar divided parts form editing text rendered wiki text sidebar right containing context dependent links constructed merely semantic information wiki pages 
semantic authoring wiksar prototype uses syntax similar ward cunningham original wiki wiki web 
create hyperlinks wiki pages interpreted subject predicate object semantic web statements rdf triples 
page name wiki page denotes subject statements embedded wiki text 
predicate object simply entered empty line wiki text separated colon space 
page named line represents statement 
combining embedded statements formal ontology emerges wiki 
important aspect ontology creation regarding semantic web adhere schemas established vocabularies 
editing assistance direction integrated wiki suggesting vocabulary external ontologies 
emerged notion mixed client server side web applications ajax asynchronous javascript xml eases creation intuitively usable interfaces google suggest del icio tag suggestions techniques support user editing semantic statements wiki 
semantic navigation context entered statements immediately create links related pages depending current context 
firstly inform user position wiki showing path back root site concept 
secondly sidebar shows pages concepts related current concept including type relationship 
special backlinks typed backlinks include links pages contain detailed information mentioned concepts current page leading deeper site taxonomy 
page typed backlink leads current concept 
hand show way back hierarchy saying author person 
important questions regarding usability web site get answered am go 
addition navigational means page semantic annotations automatically generate class hierarchy complete map ontology labeled graph typed site map 
semantic retrieval triples created wiksar available semantic queries 
triple store supports rdf query languages rdql sparql wiki space queried return distinct concepts pages 
current query syntax wiksar allows filtering specific predicate object combinations predicate operator object allowing equality quantitative comparisons regular expressions operator 
concatenating expressions spaces implies semantics 
query instanceof england returns list authors born th century england demonstrated 
semantic views query chaining wiksar accepts variety proprietary commands embeddable wiki pages generate include content gathered available data 
example links www com publications essays archives php www google com complete del icio sidebar get created putting special operators template wiki page sidebar 
likewise queries wiksar need produce search results available temporarily querying user queries embedded persistently wiki pages 
page containing query statement gets loaded specified query executed result embedded seamlessly wiki page creating special view wiki information space 
way possible maintain pages containing date query results collections related concepts 
newly entered content wiki immediately reflected dependant collections concepts manual effort 
plan collections create complex queries allowing chain queries result set query input 
allowing list concepts input manually created lists lists personal interest facilitate retrieval possibilities specific interest 
wiki collecting scientific publications user lists favourite authors favourite subjects input query retrieve publications explicit needs list available distinct wiki page 
publishing query results single wiki pages rss feed informs user immediately changes matching special interest need visit wiki 
desktop integration due flexibility wikis personal information management pim suggested 
important context bridge gap wiki accessible web browser local desktop environment local applications file system 
worlds advantages pim wiki information residing web server omnipresent accessible machine web access 
conversely reminders appointments better triggered locally calendar applications collections user centric files office documents pdfs usually reside locally 
wiksar publishes dates entered wiki remote calendar entries format 
calendar files accessible protocol imported subscribed desktop calendar applications mozilla example trigger reminders 
interesting pim applications maintenance lists web bookmarks quotes web pages 
wiksar uses called javascript statements called web browser single user click provide access information currently open web page put selected pieces text uri resource wiki 
collections may interest single person community 
wiki maintain bookmarks web quotes accessible web browser got collected 
easily annotated 
accessing local file system remote web application impossible due security reasons 
plan able local files wiki providing link desktop search engine search engines google desktop search accessible calls localhost 
approach may utilize magnet uri scheme open scheme enabling seamless integration websites locally running utilities successfully applied domain providing unique keys files file sharing applications search 
emails pim user cross platform component models email clients may provide missing link mozilla 
interactive graph visualisation navigation visualisation complex information spaces important area research help understand data 
wiki context link structure interconnections wiki pages may drawn graph done tg wiki browser labelled graphs available wiksar entered semantic web statements offer sophisticated visualisation filter possibilities merely graph un typed hyperlinked pages 
visualising ontologies possible example prot wiksar offers novel approach integrating interactive graphical representation wiki navigating wiki space possible wiki graph changing focus simultaneously views 
graph wiksar pages built entered semantic triples 
interpreted directed labelled graph subjects objects nodes predicates labelled edges 
object triple may subject edges chained spawn directed graph 
overcome problems visualising large graphs popular fisheye views hyperbolic trees show part graph interest prominently rest graph 
wiki chose special tree layout algorithm renders concept focus root tree grows tree breadth search graph provided toolkit radial tree layout node focus root resides centre visualisation children attached 
deeper descendants get displayed away centre level hierarchy resides circle root
