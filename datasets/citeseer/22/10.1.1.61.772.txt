provide quality effective medical services necessary share exchange medical information healthcare practitioners caring specific patient 
pervasive computing aims expand mobility providing services seamless fashion 
cope changing configuration due mobility user environment applications need context aware adaptive 
term context refers information retrieve current situation objects nearby 
context aware computing demands infrastructure adapts real time situation brings appropriate information services users focus main task 
context aware applications developed healthcare domain 
united states federal government enacted health insurance portability accountability act standards 
called privacy rule intended standardize management security privacy data personal medical information 
protect privacy individuals requires healthcare practitioners obtain patient consent disclosure protected health information phi authorized purposes 
important technical challenges providing pervasive healthcare services include mobility portability access authorization privacy security 
pervasive healthcare characterized high degree mobility low level infrastructural support patient home authorization data access carried mobile devices limited resources real time 
addition access control decisions may depend context time location presence certain conditions individuals 
meet challenges ubiquitous care service platform proposed 
particular context aware rule reasoning employed perform dynamic access control phi personal information

sharing privacy health information secured authorized environment imposes important technical challenge realizing pervasive healthcare 
traditional rule engine deal dynamic access control mobile computing environment

rule optimization criteria rule engine shown produce query results real time 
plan design complex scenarios conduct comprehensive test evaluation system 
general participants involved complicated interactions 
expect size knowledge base grow significantly problem complex 
currently pattern reordering done manually desirable
