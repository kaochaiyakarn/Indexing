current approaches swoogle ontology repository prot owl ontology library aiming facilitate ontology reuse focused developing ontology repositories mere listings ontologies

simple keyword approach suffers poor precision poor recall 
example user query keyword anatomy popular ontology search engines swoogle produces hits left user xml files evaluate find ontology best suited purpose 
task evaluating ontologies difficult ontologies embed metadata information intended purpose ontology maturity content level support semantic logical consistency syntactic correctness 
subjective information ontology critical evaluating ontology 
furthermore lack metadata substantially effects recall search results search facilities 
search keyword anatomy example return galen ontology popular anatomy ontologies crawled swoogle search engine 
keywords describing subject matter ontology stored part ontology metadata galen returned result query anatomy developed knowledge zone web ontology repository users submit ontologies annotate ontologies metadata information 
metadata elements features characterize ontology organized metadata ontology 
metadata information drive structured query interface users build queries allowing example find anatomy ontologies data integration developed owl available gnu license 
ontologies available structured specific queries yield relevant ontologies search results
