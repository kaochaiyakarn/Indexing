genes proteins multiple names research reveals details entities additional names substance 
authors different synonyms refer gene protein articles sub domains information retrieval information extraction benefits identifying alternate names 
biological databases genbank swissprot include synonyms databases may date 
furthermore synonym relationships gene protein names mainly extracted laborious manual review 
desirable automate process due enormous volume published information genes proteins 
distinguish types synonymy gene protein names 
type consists correspondence short long forms gene protein names lard lymphocyte associated receptor death

background synonyms different lexemes meaning 
synonymous gene protein names represent biological substances 
recognized identical biological function gene amino acid sequence 
computational linguistics related synonym detection mainly focused detecting semantically related words exact synonyms surrounding words cluster words similarity

identification synonymous patterns methods randomly selected sets synonymous gene protein names apo dr tramp lard wsl swissprot extracted medline journal articles sentences synonymous gene protein names occur 
manually identified commonalities sentences usually incorporate similar strings symbols words interest 
common patterns chosen implemented sgpe exclude sentences patterns implemented 
iteratively repeated process sentences excluded covered

medline covers biological domain domains medicine applied keywords protein gene peptide receptor select abstracts relevant biological domain 
developed pattern matching methods extract candidate synonymous gene protein names associated patterns recognized 
patterns slash comma directly selected terms lie side symbols 
patterns known known called separated patterns parentheses 
example pattern parentheses transcription factors egr called ngf tis egr egr candidate terms parentheses precede left parenthesis 
examples include parentheses include include known subunit molecular mass grp known heavy chain binding protein bip developed pattern matching methods recognize automatically terms associated parentheses

addition sgpe recognized terms precede left parenthesis 
study discarded patterns parentheses due contextual complexity difficult develop simple pattern matching approach automatic identification 
output stage sgpe sets terms pubmed id journal article id terms candidate synonymous gene protein names 
implemented filters apply external internal knowledge filter terms gene protein synonymous names 
sgpe filter applies dictionary units min sec dictionary common english words filter terms gene protein names 
rule excludes set candidate synonymous terms terms unit 
second rule excludes set candidate synonymous terms thirds terms common english words

example method kept synonymous set apo dr tramp lard wsl contain english common words 
sgpe filter applies knowledge abstracts journal articles filter sets synonymous gene protein names 
implemented sgpe filter approach developed previous study maps abbreviations full forms full forms defined parentheses sgpe filter filtered sets contain term gene protein name 
example sgpe filter filtered hiv mac hiv defined human virus type sgpe filter recognized term outside gene protein set 
methods identifying abbreviations full forms gene protein names developed previous study

step filtering candidate sets consist lot terms gene protein synonymous names 
sgpe filter filters candidate synonymous terms listed times abstracts journal articles 
implemented approach sgpe filter recognize authors introduce synonym list abstracts 
filter exclude terms units nl min kg chemical compounds 
filter exclude protein terms synonyms functionally related 
example case cd cd binding related proteins synonyms 
short gene protein names usually consist letters 
sgpe filter excludes sets single term letters 
example rule filtered set 
sgpe filter removes sets term contains dashes terms usually gene protein names
