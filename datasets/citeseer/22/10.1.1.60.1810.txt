selfish behavior section describe ocean attempts mitigate selfish routing behavior ad hoc networks 
general idea punish nodes selfish behavior rejecting traffic hopes threat act deterrent 
unfortunately hard detect selfish behavior observations routing protocol undetectable techniques node avoid visible potential router 
examples manipulation routing related messages specific dsr go undetected 
dropping route request rreq
