observed behavior frequent join leave surprising problematic behavior users mojo nation displayed frequent joining leaving 
observed common behavior join network stay connected hour leave network return 
measurements taken particular month periods october february indicated users fell group time hour group remaining significant fraction stayed connected hours permanently disconnected 
remaining persistent nodes connected network period weeks typical node remained connected short consecutive time times week 
measurement taken april showed average node connected time systematic observations suggest distribution highly skewed approximately nodes connected time rest connected approximately hours day 
picture suggested observations network half life time replacement half nodes network new arrivals usually hour times hour 
varying space allocation default disk allocation node mojo nation originally mb

users manually adjust setting 
mojo nation software report settings user chooses know support mail user feedback users complained default setting users quick point raised limit high setting usually range gb 
varying connection quality market research reports typically suggest internet users broadband connections rest relatively slow intermittent dial connections 
anecdotal evidence mojo nation consistent bryce wilcox hearn 
active minority users high quality connections including academic corporate networks 
users tended minority stay consistently connected minority allocate large amounts disk space

scalability security attack resistance trade offs implicit design decisions publically analyzed far know 
data availability network working common failure data user sought unavailable 
ascribe source problem design failure accomodate highly unreliable behavior nodes 
simultaneously believe primary reason frequent join leave behavior data users sought unavailable 
constitutes chicken egg problem solved elements design 
repeatedly tuned replication information dispersal design order counteract problem best data availability variable appeared depend server nodes connected time observation 
significant mistakes mojo nation easily avoided 
discriminate newly joined nodes 
described length time node continuously connected network predictor length time remain connected 
simple heuristic favor long lived nodes proposed reduced problems caused frequent join leave behavior 
second mojo nation erasure code split data set shares sufficiently large subset shares suffice rebuild data 
number shares required rebuild data equal total number shares generated 
intended increase data robustness availability underlying shares required total ratio case erasure code opposite intended effect dramatically reducing robustness data 
believe problems data availability compounded addition erasure code required total ratio high actual behavior nodes 
noted research section issue manage block storage face servers joining leaving remains open 
sophisticated caching replication strategies hopefully ameliorate bryce wilcox hearn problem 
addition reputation trust metric techniques described section attack resistance help discriminating unreliable servers 
mojo nation deployed software attempted exactly interaction discrimination design goals analyzed 
open problems bypassing firewalls nat challenge enabling nodes live firewalls nat act servers challenge deployed systems attempt address 
important size internet grows application level connections cross administrative boundaries 
mojo nation relay technique third node helps nodes communicate similar principle 
attack resistance malicious nodes mutual distrust motivation cooperate challenging unsolved problem mutual distrust 
network architect tempted assume nodes system behave designed behave assumption may prove fatal network deployed multiple disjoint administrative zones 
fundamentally related issue motivation cooperate 
node choose offer services network requests network 
preventing user altering copy software writing compatible implementation uses resources nodes refuses provide resource 
closely related notion attack resistance 
node resources nodes offering service return able act drain resources network possibly constituting denial service attack entire network 
hand node coerced cooperating cutting node services network retaliation lack cooperation sure mechanism attack specific innocent nodes attack network 
hopefully research pursued papers lead quantitatively justified method gaining attack resistance sacrificing design goals 
mojo nation experience shows kinds attack encountered network deployed large scale internet 
attack user alters client attempt gain advantage 
different users modifications experiences deploying large scale emergent network mojo nation software contacted describe 
users modifications aware changes indirectly observations anomalous behavior 
second kind attack enemy attempts remove central components network legal means 
legal action initiated fast track network centrally administered components original service design implementation distribution software 
emergent file store mojo nation partially success partially failure 
parts failed centralized original mechanism data storage scheme proved fragile deployed network surprisingly short half life 
problems straightforwardly solved practice possible directions advancement theory 
addition believe long term large scale emergent network need address open problems attack resistance malicious nodes mutual distrust motivation cooperate
