briefly introduce common ideas wfm theory 
describe wfm terms demo theory notions mentioned incorporated 
description focused coordination coordination patterns transactions organizations gives somewhat different view workflow support wfm systems provide

workflow management systems workflow management coalition wfmc workflow defined automation part business process documents information tasks passed participant action set rules 
wfm systems provide support defining creating managing execution workflows software able interpret process definition interact participants invoke external applications 
coalition presents model describing necessary components interfaces functionality wfm systems 
wfm system consists functional components definition tool define business processes worklist handler interaction users personal worklists managed workflow engine provides runtime execution environment 
workflow engine interprets process definition manages different instances business process allocates resources tasks performed 
workflow engine provide interface invoke external applications human participants perform certain tasks interface external workflow engines order cooperate shared process execution appearing provide single enactment service 
aalst useful definition wfm systems 
workflow defined case driven business process distinction business processes workflow dimensions process consists definition tasks sequence performed resource consists people machines perform tasks case specific instance thing dealt business process 
task performed specific case called workitem workitem performed specific resource called activity 
clear definition concepts involved wfm systems 
workflow definition consists aspects sequence definition tasks involved process collection human machine resources tasks capable performing collection cases handled business process 
definition workflows aalst suggests high level petri nets 
tasks mapped transitions resulting facts places 
resource dimension suggested kind role assignment define tasks performed roles 
case dimension suggested map instances cases petri net tokens appropriate attributes

coordination demo coordination viewed levels abstraction performative informative formative 
distinction levels important perform coordination act certain conditions met levels 
formative condition implies information exchanged expressed transmitted perceived distortion 
informative condition implies addressee understood coordination act intellectually 
performative condition implies addressee information feels socially responsible respond 
conditions levels met coordination take place 
duration production scheduling important part wfm system functionality 
consists choosing person perform certain task case multiple persons able perform task 
scheduling done numerous factors possible scheduling instance estimated duration task time available persons able perform task relative priority task compared tasks
