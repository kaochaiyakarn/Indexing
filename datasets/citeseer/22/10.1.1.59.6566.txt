key factor assumption rdf lacks document structure html xml formats primarily hierarchy sequence 
hierarchy sequence long cornerstones document structure 
human authors large amounts information readily accessed learned readers grouping sorting meaningful insightful ways 
core aspect xml lets writers focus hierarchy sequence documents independent subsequently rendered presentation 
course rdf intentionally lacks hierarchy sequence choosing facilitate machine processing assertions encodes 
focus machine processing necessarily preclude immediate accessibility humans just access complex 
lacking document structure means lacking document form users familiar making rdf interfaces users 
converting rdf structure document structure domain independent manner give information encodes accessibility html enjoys 
automated generation sensible informative document structure source structure remains difficult problem domain independent processing rdf 
goal generate navigable structures orient user current local context communicates structure perspective provides navigation maintaining sense orientation information space 
key assumption strategies human document authors deploy convey information readers apply certain extent automated presentation semantic web data

semantic web provides ways inferring additional characteristics explicitly encoded 
subclass property causes property value assignments component effectively copied 
extra property value assignments provide extra characteristics cluster 
subclasses recursive property class inherited descendant classes 
recursion enables clustering generate levels resulting hierarchies 
subclasses aria rdf encoding hierarchy genres genre concept resources subclass property parent genres making genres strong component generated multi level hierarchies 
relevance sequencing 
just hierarchy sequence core component document structure 
sequence components document appear communicates important insights relationships 
web search engines sequence returns relevance measures placing matches front list 
sequence functional informative 
noadster performs sequencing sorting subgroups common parent matching resources contain making groups content relevant topic request appear earlier 
semantic sequencing 
sorting relevance useful clearly sequence components documents typically meaningful 
document sequence hierarchy communicates relationships components 
derives meaningful sequence underlying meta data sorting artifacts group year creation 
sorting quite domain specific 
domainindependent components noadster benefit knowledge properties repository generate meaningful sequence 
presenting structure tables contents means textbooks traditionally give global view hierarchical structure 
provide direct access particular sections page numbers function effectively links 
presenting hierarchical groups involves adding introductory sections group subsections 
adaptations techniques presenting generated structure 
conveying hierarchy 
systems properly communicate hierarchical structure user understands relationships search returns structure represents 
hierarchical list displays commonly means conveying hierarchies spatial layout 
folding displays lets users quickly navigate structure particularly useful large hierarchies 
quick navigation traditional search engine results lets users overcome inaccuracies inherent automated search user quickly check links choose match 
principle works hierarchies flat lists search results 
quick navigation hierarchies helps users inaccuracies inherent automated generation 
means communicate hierarchy helps global interface unified document topic 
introductions 
documents just place components hierarchical groups describe nature groups 
text books typically introductions sections 
describes true section going details components helping communicate user significance section relationships exist contents 
derivation document hierarchy rdf describes assigns group rdf component representing group commonality 
local interface display grouping component manner search matches 
demonstrator formed groups provided navigation original search matches display representing groups

subsection discusses selection media display specific subject rdf repository 
focal point 
key concept model focal point network 
focal point node edge rdf graph specified uri 
focal point body information hub potentially statements spanning collectively provide information 
focal point devoid content 
media conveying comes statements 
system selects media content statements 
associated statements 
statement repository basic unit statement associated current focal point 
identify associated statements set statements including focal point subject value property 
viewing current focal point user direct access resources sharing statement focal point 
literals 
rdf repository collection statements uris nodes edges graph statements involve literal values 
consist plain text better suited direct display presentation uris 
shown direct display literal content typically problematic rdf literals relatively small pieces text 
labels 
particularly informative type literal rdfs label 
rdfs defines human readable version resource name 
part rdfs property semantic significance applies rdf repositories making essentially domain independent 
label component name especially useful important piece text 
displaying labels 
sesame explore mode option replaces uris interface associated labels available 
noadster making text link resource contain resource label 
noadster goes making labels titles screen displays resources displaying top large bold font shown entry main display 
noadster gives entry global view label shows uri 
noadster treats rdfs label initial means conveying resource user current resource immediately traversable 
comments 
presentable rdfs construct rdfs comment 
rdfs defines human readable description resource 
comment label 
noadster gives rdfs comments special display just title top local view main display entries shown 
inferencing 
inferring label comment properties domain specific ones efficient way repositories accessible generalized rdf browsers 
authors encode inference making certain domain specific properties rdfs subproperty rdfs label rdfs comment 
requires rdfs triple property instances labels comments 
aria repository example names artists subproperties rdfs label 
single rdfs assignment artist names recognized displayed labels 
external media 
rdf properties values literals uris 
uris directly presentable media items literals systems integrate screen displays 
noadster performs direct integration images 
focal point shares statement image resource noadster presents directly display 
shows user image image noadster applies number standard strategies find mime type resource improving display 
example image resources related painting appear directly associated statements 
structure allowing access uris related directly current fo cal point provides user interface challenge statements associated focal point 
layout group statements provide overview different types information related focal point allow user find quickly type information satisfies current information need 
rdf grouping 
noadster groups statements shared subject property value 
method distinctions seen flat rdf graph structure defined directly encoded statements 
additional spatial grouping come components joined subclass rdfs subproperty properties 
clustering statements 
global clustering techniques section apply structuring local display spatial layout 
clustering groups items shared characteristics 
specifically shared characteristic rdf property value statements multiple resources act statement subject 
noadster case mentioned common single statement roles important clustering characteristic 
potential characteristics include namespace subjects values role focal point plays statements 
clustering determines grouping strategy puts related statements 
allows levels depth grouping providing document hierarchy 
user selection clustering strategies applies spatial clustering 
multiple displays single focal points 
grouped layout helps users sort larger amounts information resources rdf repositories easily involve far statements appear single display 
potential solution applying clustering techniques group statements separate displays just separate screen areas large 
user perspective separate display units resource focal points
