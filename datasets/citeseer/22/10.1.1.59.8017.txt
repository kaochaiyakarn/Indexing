second design embodiment hypothesis regarding technology change social practices communities 
third design evaluated testing hypothesis field 
oulasvirta rest organized empirical stages 
design cases provided illustrate ideas 
stage empirical studies discover user needs empirical challenge discover articulate users motivations needs addressed new technology 
challenging theoretically initial stage 
corporations traditionally market research methods surveys investigate needs 
surveys worked quantifying customers preferences really help discovering new needs come existing applications 
driven research supposed needs recognized personal lives researchers adopted previous research 
cases necessarily generalize larger population 
cases articulated concretely enable design choices 
discovering motivational needs short useful main reasons 
human need lasts longer specific solution 
second needs opportunities design just guesses 
innovation potential depend predicting crucial part exists form human needs 
third human needs provide roadmap design becker 
conceptual basis technology innovation context suggested distinguished types human needs motivational needs action needs 
motivational needs rationalize motivate certain action context 
motivational needs experienced emotional behavioral potentials activated particular situational incentives see atkinson 
example social need affiliation activated incentive having opportunity please gain approval turn causes person want act certain way constituted situation action need 
furthermore helpful elaborate distinction types motivational needs basic 
user may harbor multitude basic needs related hci situation related regulating bodily homeostasis physiological needs pain avoidance thirst hunger sex providing psychological growth healthy development organismic psychological needs self determination competence relatedness preferring aspects environment social needs achievement affiliation intimacy power reeve 
quasi needs hand ephemeral induced wants create tense energy engage behavior capable reducing built tension reeve 
full blown needs sense basic needs affect think feel act 
example desire umbrella rain money store considered quasi need 
basic quasi needs instantiated situation user eventually wants perform certain action takes closer satisfying motivational need 
motivational needs provide promising starting point discovering design opportunities 
individual level complemented looking societal demands technology oulasvirta 
case user needs related grounding innovation technologies mobility illustrate needs direct innovation new concepts 
example personal social cognitive needs mobility aim oulasvirta discover motivational needs mobility public urban areas 
order gather rich data focus groups studies interviews observation studies conducted 
idea triangulation methods study phenomenon gather third person person data describe person 
situations participants consider problematic fail come workarounds forced deviate routine action provide bases discovering motivational needs 
travel episodes descriptions person moving city pursuit goal analyzed manner 
classes needs related mobility 
class personal needs 
example paying sharing costs people public places participants expressed concerns losing control money 
moving certain places trigger memories opinions considered worth preserving 
needs category finding silence privacy middle crowd finding expending time seeking fun exceptions 
second class needs relates navigation wayfinding cognitive nature 
participants expressed need know optimize routes 
example participant got lost returning home picking flowers unfamiliar place 
similarly journalists received mail invitations events unknown locations city 
reaching navigation goal time considered important equally important having time unplanned deviations planned route 
packing carrying items received plenty attention related need anticipate prepare predicted events umbrella forecasted rain 
needs related ability combine sites route finding shortest route locating missing objects safety avoiding potentially dangerous areas 
third class social needs identified 
example amateur theatre group decide new rehearsal schedule group members decision took place 
decided absent members informed call ring 
turned somebody forgotten call actors show rehearsal 
reflects need awareness changes shared schedules 
situations observed participants need continuously aware social surroundings 
expressed need aware acquaintances moving city 
participants need meet new people expending extra time 
situation realized finding talk difficult 
similar need discussion topics gathered situation friends waiting caf skimmed newspaper discussed headlines 
participants curious events place environment eager share opinions peers expressed needs shop friend get opinion friend product delight dropping promising store buying gifts 
oulasvirta example ii needs mobile elderly people conducted similar study discover needs elderly people related mobility communication 
study revealed needs maintaining contacts family participants learned mail internet purpose friends met retirement 
time curiosity get know surroundings better find new places afraid getting lost safety 
expressed doubt changes environment wanted share opinions spent considerable time monitoring neighborhoods 
aesthetics nature environment important 
able combine experiences routine tasks going friends abroad shop 
traveling reserved extra time arrive early bus station 
appreciated fast reliable quiet transportation platforms slippery winter 
traveling considered unpleasant eager share experiences unsafe areas practices services 
example iii prototype prototype illustrate inform innovation product concepts direct design choices 
inspired observations interviews elderly people difficulties remembering past events objects products indirectly hampers ability social sharing experiences freedom mobility 
hypothesized supporting remembering organizing everyday events elderly people impaired memory abilities improved sharing life events peers supported
