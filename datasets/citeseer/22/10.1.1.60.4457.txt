experiments carried real test bed confirm validity efficiency approach 

background protocol test bed uses olsr protocol ad hoc network routing algorithm solution applied proactive scheme 
olsr algorithm employs efficient dissemination network topology information selecting special nodes multipoint relays mprs forward broadcast messages flooding process 
order allow injection external routing information ad hoc network olsr protocol defines host network association hna message 
hna message binds set network prefixes ip address node attached external networks gateway node 
way ad hoc node informed network address network reachable gateway 
olsr exploits mechanism default routes advertise internet connectivity 
instance gateway advertises default route receive packets destined ip addresses route local ad hoc network 

internet connectivity proxy arp proposed architecture depicted 
olsr ad hoc network interconnected master gateway mg wired lan provides connectivity external internet 
wired lan ip subnetwork identified ip ip network address ip network mask length example 
wired nodes ip addresses belong ip wired hosts able exchange packets arp table list mappings ip address layer mac address layer known hosts subnet 
connectivity wired lan internet provided router standard ip routing protocols 

test bed implementation 
olsr ad hoc network consist mobile ad hoc nodes ii fixed backbone formed mg node multiple slave gateways sgs connected wired links 
mg node wired interfaces single wireless interface acts gateway allowing ad hoc network connected internet 
sg nodes interfaces wireless wired ensures routing separated parts ad hoc network wired infrastructure 
ad hoc routing protocol implemented daemon runs interfaces wireless wired mobile nodes sg nodes mg node exception mg node wired interface provides access external network advertising internet connectivity default routes hna messages 
mobile nodes configured static ip address belonging subnet wired lan ip hybrid nodes interfaces configured private ip addresses 
done facilitate configuration mg node explained 
worth remarking devised sgs nodes simple entities supporting ad hoc node mobility increasing available bandwidth mg node mobile nodes 
reason need globally routable ip address 
connectivity outgoing traffic 
daemon builds routing tables entries specify ip address hop neighbour contact send packet destined host subnetwork 
mg node advertises default route packets destined ip addresses route ad hoc network routed default route mg node forwarded internet 
special case mobile node wants send packet addressed node local wired lan node 
destination ip address belongs ip routing table lookup source node assume destination node directly connected node wireless interface 
result failed arp request address sent source node wireless interface 
solve problem split original ip subnet consecutive subnets ip sl ip su ip ip sl ip su 
example 
mg node advertise subnets hna messages 
way mobile node host local wired lan routing table entry specific network mask related wireless interface ip 
consequently criterion routing table lookup determine right hop address 
connectivity incoming traffic 
allow nodes local wired lan including router send packets mobile nodes specific daemon runs interface mg node called ad hoc proxy arp daemon 
daemon periodically checks master gateway routing table arp table publish mg node mac address ip address having entry routing table 
entries related interface mg node sg nodes interfaces excluded 
mg node acts proxy arp mobile nodes 
host local wired lan send packet mobile node ad hoc network deems destination wired network 
node checks arp table ip mac mapping sends arp request 
mg node answers arp reply providing mac address packets correctly sent destination mg node
