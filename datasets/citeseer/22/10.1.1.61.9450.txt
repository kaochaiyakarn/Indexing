scenario italian line bank needs obtain minimum personal information customers perform services 
information includes name address email

customer gives personal information bank order receive bank statements

credit union privacy concerns united states enforces different measures protect privacy taken european union 
united states adopts approach mix legislation regulation

secure tropos privacy secure tropos agent oriented methodology extending tropos framework intended model analyze security privacy requirements individual social levels 
framework uses concepts actor service goal task resource social relationships defining objectives capabilities actors 
actors intentional entities perform actions achieve goals represent agents individual level roles social level 
goal represents strategic interest actor 
task represents way doing 
resource represents physical informational entity 
social relationships functional dependencies delegations permission trust relations ownership provisioning 
functional dependency actors indicates actor depends accomplish goal execute task deliver resource 
delegation permission models formal passage authority signed piece digital credential occurring domain analysis 
basic idea ownership actor full authority concerning access disposition services 
owning goal means owner decide fulfill goal provide fulfillment 
distinction owning provisioning clear model situations example customer legitimate owner personal data web service provider stores customer personal data provides access data 
setting provider needs consent data owner maintaining data web service provider maintain customer data customer previously delegated permission 
trust relations refer belief clients provider misuse personal data 
framework essentially consists models defined social individual levels see ref
