conceptually difficult designing organisms metamorph typically involves considerable amount time consuming trial error 
due inherently parallel nature morphogenetic processes 
grns suffer deleterious butterfly effect seemingly innocuous change large unforeseen effects 
reasons designing complex quadruped shape consisting body appropriately sized positioned limbs see website took week 
intention investigate processes hand designing organisms metamorph easily adapted evolutionary experiments adding code generate candidate genomes assess resultant organisms fitness function 
general techniques section discuss number principles techniques morphogenetic programming preliminary experiments attempting various shapes

making protein autocatalytic gene producing substantially positive bias differentiation indefinitely allowing cells switched way promoters 
note mechanism means cell function generally inherited cell divides may may desirable depending situation 
delays 
situations useful cell wait period time initiating action 
instance creating hollow shape may want give cells chance grow outwards killing close centre 
way achieve effect create accumulator protein low decay constant 
fully activated gene produces accumulator number time steps protein produced accumulator reaches threshold 
longer delays created chain accumulators 
quasi binary processing

location specific cell selection 
build simplest shapes necessary pick cells perform special functions position embryo 
single cell produce radially symmetric signal gradient specific level external protein shared sphere cell sites 
uniquely pinpointing location requires intersection spheres requires cells different places emitting different signals 
chicken egg problem position cells required positioning 
solution useful follows 
assuming signal cell set cell finds correct distance second signal cell breaking symmetry arbitrarily 
cell find appropriate distances existing signal cells third 
course essential cell assumed particular signalling role 
achieved presence signal inhibits cells emitting signal

prevent inhibiting 
method accumulator protein create delay see 
correct distance existing signal cell causes certain protein produced 
protein triggers production accumulator 
accumulator reaches threshold level autocatalytic marker produced locking cell role causing signal emitted
