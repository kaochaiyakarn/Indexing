inconvenience methods intermediate data produced machine learning techniques difficult interpret human reader 
methods help understand classification task consequently determination features classifier usually reduced process trial error past trials help determine optimal set features 
features allow description inherently sequential aspect sentences 
example bags words occurrence part speech pos tags semantically related words lose sequential ordering words 
order words sentence contains information may useful classification 
alternative approach handcrafted regular expressions indicate sentences belong certain class contrast machine learning approach maintain word order information 
example consider regular expression far classify questions having eat distance 
method brings fairly acceptable results specific structures sentence clearly mark sentence type case question classification coarse grained set eat 
regular expression approach advantage regular expressions human readable easy understand 
creating trivial 
having fine grained classes extremely hard manually create regular expressions distinguish closely related classes 
method aims advantages methods machine learning methods regular expressions 
machine learning patterns extracted training data

overview structure induction classification process sections describe classifiers fit approach 
alignment learning classifier uses grammatical inference system find structure sentences explicitly 
structure converted set regular expressions fed classifier 
trie classifier builds trie structure represents sentences training corpus 
finds regularities trie classifies new sentences regularities 
alignment learning classifier structure extraction phase system done alignment learning abl 
abl generic grammatical inference framework learns structure plain text 
applied corpora different languages results compares grammatical inference systems 
underlying idea abl constituents sentences interchanged 
give example substitute noun phrase man sentence sees man noun phrase woman get valid sentence sees woman 
process reversed aligning sentences possible constituents called hypotheses marked grouping 
called alignment learning phase 
table shows structure learned sample sentences 
grouping marked parentheses 
abl framework consists phases clustering selection learning 
clustering phase groups similar non terminal labels assigned hypotheses alignment learning phase 
selection learning phase resolves problem alignment learning phase 
alignment learning phase may introduce overlapping hypotheses 
unwanted underlying grammar considered context free resulting structure taken parse sentence underlying grammar 
interested need structure 
clustering selection learning concentrate results alignment learning phase 
methods alignment learning phase described literature 
due practical restrictions time space memory implementation 
alignments building uncovers re occurring sequences words sentences 
sequences hypotheses introduced 
structure extracted classification 
training sentence associated corresponding class structure extracted certain sentence provides evidence structure related class 
structure occurs classes occurs multiple sentences different classes associated structure stored classes respective frequencies 
stored structures seen regular expressions classification structures matched new sentence 
regular expression matches class corresponding frequency information remembered structures tried class highest frequency selected output 
explain different implementations walking example

regular expression matches method called default increase counts classes question frequency stored classes regular expression 
second method called prior increase counts classes sentence related regular expression default method increase frequency count class 
regular expressions tried default method selects class highest frequency frequency chosen random prior method selects highest count selects class highest frequency

called look ahead process 
look ahead process works follows 
say words sentence match sk word match sk

trie implementations benefit pos information

adding pos generally improves abl system case implementation

abl classifier extracts roughly regular expressions applied training data trie contains set training questions consists nearly nodes 
investigating trie system works noticed questions performed replacement total number questions strict method pos tagged data provided correct results

flex method data test shows lower success rate
