approach significance applications linguistics ai cover greater detail 
explain underlying problems natural language processing describing actual implementation section 
limits automated word sense disambiguation central task natural language processing application disambiguate words encountered text determine lexical entries belong 
normally involves lexicon syntactic parser 
inverse relationship lexical syntactic processing simple shallow lexicon requires detailed syntactic parser detailed lexicon requires shallow parser 
tendency linguistic research focus improvements representation detail lexica 
may limit detail represented lexicon 
example basili 
claim randomly chosen newspaper paragraph sentence extended sense word usually verb sense breaks conventional preferences considered extended metaphorical quite standard lexicon examples pustejovsky illustrate problem sentence woman finished beer verb finish synonymous stopped drinking man finished cigarette synonymous extinguished 
common sense viewpoint obvious shared meaning sentences act finishing activity 
detailed lexical representation include logical inferences different 
natural language processing application need know appropriate activity finishing ordering new case beer lighting case cigarettes 
information stored cigarettes beer finishing 
stored general terms alcoholic beverage rule format 
example shows issues complicated 
second example looked window opposed painted window 
case window stands glass window 
second case stands frame window 
natural language processing application need know glass transparent break frames variety materials 
essentially lexical database need store detailed descriptions windows 
different types windows exist enormous amount information 
priss asserts types problems outlined examples may require linguistic knowledge humans store informa tion linguistic format 
humans parse linguistic ambiguities utilizing common sense non linguistic knowledge world 
ultimately automated natural language processing may need combined methods perceptive robotic interfaces associative interfaces facilitate better operation humans computers 
lexical databases ontological knowledge clear dividing line lexical databases ai ontologies 
traditionally lexical databases formalized ai ontologies 
example wordnet fellbaum formalized ai ontology cyc 
contemporary linguistic representations lexical knowledge formalized logic formal ontologies 
problem vicious cycle automatic construction detailed lexica automatic construction precise ontologies solution lexical tuning parsing lexicon corpus unsupervised learning fig 

vicious cycle possible solution depicted left half lexical databases ai ontologies form vicious cycle construction detailed lexica requires precise ontological information vice versa 
linguistic structures convey information knowledge domains expressed language 
example scottish people words rain people live dryer 
quoted examples kinship terms color terms just cultural differences number color terms example paint industry food vocabulary 
lexica serve source information ai ontology engineers 
ontologies useful natural language processing differences meaning correspond syntactic differences verb transitively 
processing text helpful construct model underlying semantic structures describe underlying ai ontology 
large size lexica changing nature language construction lexica ai ontologies semi automatic achieve sufficient depth 
large corpora world wide web provide unlimited resource lexical input 
vicious cycle holds sophisticated parsing presupposes existing sophisticated lexical databases vice versa 
basili 
state words easily disambiguated knows selectional restrictions selectional restrictions easily identified knows disambiguated meanings words 
bootstrapping linguistic information large corpora fortunately vicious cycles dissolved bootstrapping 
case basili 
claim lexicon quality starting point 
depicted right half lexicon improved corpus driven unsupervised learning corpus 
improved lexicon re applied parsing corpus improves learning corpus forth 
form bootstrapping lexical tuning basili process refining lexical entries adapt new domains purposes 
basili approach described remainder section formal concept analysis 
formal concept analysis provides excellent tool lexical tuning duality formal objects attributes represent linguistic dualities verb frames noun phrases corpus derived sentence parts rule lexical structures drive bootstrapping process 
verbs difficult disambiguate nouns adjectives 
verb subcategorization frames result classifying verbs argument structures 
example verb multiply usually mathematical meaning multiply occurs direct object biological meaning bacteria multiplied occurs direct object 
prepositional modifiers syntactic constituents occur verb indicate subcategorization frame 
frames correspond different senses recorded lexicon 
verb corpus matched sense comparing subcategorization frame frames lexicon entry verb 
basili 
describe machine learning method extracting verb subcategorization frames corpus 
parsing corpus formal context derived verb 
objects formal context phrases contain verb 
attributes arguments verbs direct indirect objects prepositions 
phrases argument structure clustered extension object concept 
stage concept lattices represent possible subcategorization frames 
natural language processing parsing automatic identification verb argument structures corpus yield error free results 
furthermore language ambiguous absolutely perfect results 
generating lattices needs identified concepts lattice represent senses verb acceptable corpus 
basili describe methods assign weights nodes concept lattices verb facilitate selection relevant subcategorization frames 
weights trained training subset corpus 
probabilistic models prepositions derived correspond specific domain corpus 
incorporated calculations 
methods probable verb frames selected context 
improved precision basili point automatic extraction human lexicographer lattice verb decision tool manual lexicon construction 
estimates state constructing lexical entry english hand takes hour automatically derived lattices verb guideline significant time 
possible applications ontology engineering basili 
experimentally evaluate approach purpose lexical tuning conclude improves techniques 
approach successfully implemented variety projects lexical tuning example basili 

believe approach promising applications 
example conceptual graphs sowa similar verb subcategorization frames 
concept lattices automatically derived core concepts set conceptual graphs objects relations attributes

basic algorithm clusters verbs potentially meaningful groups indicated circles 
circles meant automatically derivable 
open human interpretation data 
conceivable apply algorithm complete brown corpus corpora obtain event hierarchy useful ontology engineering 
ontologies focus noun hierarchies overlook hierarchies verbs event structures argument structures 
promising exception basili develops event hierarchies information extraction multilingual document analysis

formalizing lexical databases thesauri ontologies roget thesaurus lexical database wordnet formalized formal concept analysis methods 
roget thesaurus contains level classification 
lowest level words grouped synonymous closely related semantic field animals food items 
polysemy words occur multiple times thesaurus 
construct concept lattice words objects thesaurus classes attributes explore polysemy 
lattice thesaurus far large visualized 
wille describes method constructing smaller called neighborhood lattices 
semantic neighborhood word consists words share meanings word means words occur original word bottom level class thesaurus 
set objects neighborhood lattice consists semantic neighborhood word 
attributes bottom level thesaurus classes original word bottom level thesaurus classes words neighborhood 
choice depends larger smaller semantic environment intended 
example shows neighborhood lattice old 
lattice shows separate clusters meanings temporal completion direction senses distinguished senses 
visible lattice nodes right share top bottom rest lattice 
left side lattice shows different levels intensity addition excess superiority distance past 
similar examples 
distance past superiority past excess addition excess covering addition top repetition height restoration inversion excess height relation er remainder extra left remaining location completeness direction roundabout fig 

neighborhood lattice old time contrast roget thesaurus synonym sets wordnet occur levels hierarchy just bottom 
furthermore hyponymy hierarchy relational structure wordnet 
relations wordnet hierarchical 
part relation hierarchical necessarily meaningful embed lattice intersections parts may meaningful 
example substance relation cake contain sugar salt sugar salt meaningful grouping 
reasons wordnet requires slightly different modeling roget thesaurus 
priss develops relational concept analysis means modeling wordnet similar lexical databases 
advantage approach semantic relations implemented bases means reduced set relation instances complete relation derived priss 
analyzing semantic relations lexical databases formalization wordnet roget thesaurus described previous section serve basis linguistic cognitive anthropological analysis structures knowledge encoded lexical databases 
priss uses relational concept analysis analyze meronymy part relations word net 
classifications types meronymy manually derived semantic analysis fuzzy agreed different researchers 
priss shows relational concept analysis facilitates derivation classification meronymy entirely structural analysis 
classification fuzzy retains significant amount information contained manually derived classifications 
method analyzing wordnet formal concept analysis identifies facets noun hierarchy 
facets regular structures regular polysemy 
shows example family relationships wordnet arranged facets scales 
comparing merging lexical databases lexical databases formalized concept lattices lattices serve interlingua creating multilingual databases identify lexical gaps different languages 
idea mentioned wille concept lattices semantic fields bodies water english german 
lower half example taken old priss shows separate concept lattices english german words building 
main difference english german english house applies small residential buildings denoted letter german small office buildings denoted letter larger residential buildings called 
factories normally called german
