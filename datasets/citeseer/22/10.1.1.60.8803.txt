business economics approaches market mechanisms market mechanisms built lines economic markets 
approach systems modelled lines economic model participating entities act increasing personal profit utility 
system wide parameters modelled manner similar macroeconomic variables economic growth 
parameters individual entities correspond microeconomic parameters 
key point systems select suitable micro level parameter values market interaction rules desired system goals local global achieved 
market approaches contrast traditional way modelling self organisation emergence economic systems primarily analytic general equilibrium models example done 
main problem analytic approaches represent possible situations due non linearity economic phenomena due fact economies complex dynamic systems 
market approaches view macroeconomic phenomena emergent results local interactions economic entities 
example economic growth described macro level explained level 
reason economic growth results interaction variety economic actors create technology demanding customers 
numerous variations market selforganisation mechanisms 
exemplar mechanism creative destruction principle described section 
creative destruction creative destruction term coined denote process industrial mutation economic structure destroying old creating new 
words creative destruction occurs new setting eliminates old leading economic development 
view economic system destroy efficient firms order room new possibly efficient entrants 
representative example creative destruction evolution personal computer industry lead microsoft intel destroyed mainframe computer companies time important technological achievements century created 
main roles economic actors play economy producer worker consumer 
producers produce goods provide services consumers demand 
consumers consume goods services exchange monetary utility value 
high demand producers tend hire workers assist goods production service provision exchange wage 
producers sell production hold money pay workers order start production get necessary money entering debt 
creative destruction principle producers able pay worker wages go bankrupt removed system example reduced simple workers opening way economic entities try successful producers satisfy consumer demand 
creative destruction process better illustrated credit economy 
contrast monetary economy producers borrow existing money credit economy allows producers obtain credit self organising mechanisms social 
informatica certain level order pay production new products 
way producers easily force way market danger bankrupt increased 
explain economic development framework needs explain entrepreneurs want introduce new products market 
effective entrepreneurs survive battle increase profit 
failed entrepreneurs debt go bankrupt eliminated 
initially stated evaluated experimentally example economic growth model generated cycles emerge disturbance caused entrepreneurs entering market introducing new products 
model particular interest global macro economic perspective local microeconomic 
individual producers decide entrepreneur policy increase profit avoid risk getting bankrupt 
hand economic system regulators decide selforganisation rules increase system production growth 
business related mechanisms business related mechanisms business models theories self organisation 
increasingly complex global economy businesses faced unpredictable behaviours fast pace change

personalised marketing personalised marketing refers personalised market strategy individual customer evolving customer reactions 
typical example approach variable pricing model refers providing individual offer customer internet technologies 
model uses self organisation marketing policies changing customers targeted prices quoted market dynamics customer characteristics business goals 
shift personalised marketing models viewed driven syndication 
syndication involves sale customers integrate offerings redistribute case redistributing popular tv programs 
example syndication tracking system ways 
allows customers access computer systems web site monitor status packages 
corporate customers provide software tools enable organisation automate shipping track packages computing resource 
customer offered different prices depending variety parameters 
websites ebay apply variable pricing offers 
activity management example area management theory activity described

emphasis solving potential conflicts interests inner external operative activity 
approach structure virtual 
clear hierarchy control control effects initiated vertically horizontally round table meetings organised lines assessment meetings normally held companies assess results handle exceptions 
virtual round tables suitable participants soon emerge de facto leaders due knowledge experience 
subsequently leaders tend participate newly formed round table
