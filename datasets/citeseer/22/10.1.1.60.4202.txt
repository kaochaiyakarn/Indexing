automatic generation social network data electronic mail communications jason yee robert mills gilbert peterson summer air force institute technology organizations formal informal elements 
formal structures usually documented organizational charts showing chain command levels authority personnel resources 
actual effectiveness organization specific individuals may depend informal structures internal communication networks 
definition personality dependent may provide significant insight gets done organization 
effective leaders want insight informal structures various reasons 
inefficient decision making staffing processes may result unnecessary redundant communications single points failure delay decisions degrade quality decisions 
sudden changes informal structures may indicate underlying stresses organization interpersonal conflicts behavioral problems may significantly disrupt mission effectiveness morale organization 
documenting informal structures networks achieved variety means personal interviews direct observation difficult time consuming

performance demonstrated months real data medium sized organization 
interpersonal communication behavior important productivity innovation organizations 
information insight understanding communication behavior useful organization 
social network analysis relatively new field psychology sociology founded idea relationships people just important attributes people 
social network analysis provides rigorous standardized framework analyzing internal communication patterns individuals groups increasingly powerful tool 
broad application social network analysis help streamline business processes improve internal organizational communication position routers network topology great success 
social network data analyzed graph theory concepts allowing speed power computers leveraged 
unfortunately generating social network data time consuming may require large degree cooperation subjects studied 
additionally social network change time shifts workload project prioritization render existing data obsolete 
purpose research investigate means efficiently building social network map automated tools procedures administrative logs computer mediated communications

social network analysis social network analysis draws fields psychology sociology study people relationships groups people 
generally easier study individuals attributes ultimate goal understand society relationships group social entities affect individuals 
wasserman describes social network analysis distinct research perspective social behavioral sciences distinct social network analysis assumption importance relationships interacting units 
focusing attributes individuals done standard social analysis social network analysis focuses ties interactions relationships individuals way characterizing behavior 
social network analysts study ties interpret functioning light actors relations network members 
social network data example standard sociological study importance individuals organization count number phone calls individual receives take account attributes callers age gender shown table study concludes hypothesizing relationship attributes measured importance sample

intrinsically graphs adhere rules graph theory 
graph theory useful social network analysis provides vocabulary label denote social structural properties 
gives social network analysts tools studying graph theory mathematical operations concepts quantify measure structural properties 
importantly giving social networks rigorous symbolic representation means power computers leveraged aid research 
social network analysis capabilities widespread availability computers fruits labor lengthy interview observational study tedious arithmetic calculate metrics social network data analyze 
required create visualization social structure 
computers changed speed social network analysis dramatically 
social network analysis programs pajek calculate properties graph visualize clicks mouse 
programs graph theory algorithms concepts quickly calculate social network metrics 
basic metrics social network analysis revolve activity betweenness closeness 
activity measured terms degrees number ties actor 
betweenness measure shortest paths actors go specific actor 
closeness measure connections required connect actors 
basic social network concepts calculate social network metrics gain information entire network actors 
social network analysis metrics may useful freeman density power cores

difficulty gathering social network data gathering social network data difficult time consuming task 
complicated dealing large populations protracted periods time 
standard methods data collection include conducting interviews surveys observing actors extracting data archived records 
interview survey approach collecting data extremely time consuming possible situations 
interviews surveys inconvenience people studied potentially invade privacy especially need repeated longitudinal study 
additionally questions asked fairly simple taken context 
questions lead bounding number connections asking name certain number 
addition questions capture relative weight relationship presence tie 
resources expended carry interviews surveys 
network roundtable university virginia developed tool generate social network data results customizable online surveys 
process requires user interaction accurate person filling survey 
resources required observe social structure people especially high time consuming 
observation requires getting permission studied permission granted 
observers gather information method data collection works best studying relatively small groups people close interaction 
hand cost social network data archived information require direct interaction live subjects 
information gathered lots different sources newspapers attendance records email traffic 
gathering data recorded archives done short period time opposed gathering data happens making easier perform longitudinal studies 
require time read archived data extract pertinent information 
archives records past provide information current social structure
