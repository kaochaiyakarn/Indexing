concept semantic zoom display data content inside scatterplot proved intuitive easy grasp 
users appreciated concise design interface overloaded information 
user feedback helped identify important issues improvement regards zoom interaction visual encodings 
zooming 
separation steering zoom interaction intended simplify navigation proved failure 
users sequential procedure tedious slow clearly prefer step purely pen zoom interaction 
navigation buttons suggested user behavior view panning 
zooming item users experienced difficulties accurately achieving right magnification scale reading text 
regard may useful introduce bounded guided way zooming 
book raskin instance suggests predefined zoom ratios query history showing previous search movies related name john 
zooming slows briefly stops making easier get characters standard sizes 
visualization 
having problem spatial mapping quantitative nominal data users got confused gray scale encoding multiple data points 
effect related size scatterplot items 
smaller panel harder user distinguish different shades filling color 
user feedback concerning experimental bookmarking mechanism turned ambiguous 
asked bookmark dvd users recognize edge record card area kept looking check box

users appreciated concept visual query history 
powerful feature demanding simple back button approach needs explanation 
considering screen design better visual differentiation query history retrieval scatterplot suggested avoid confusion modes 
visual mapping combo boxes scatterplot axes needs improved 

macromedia flash proved choice rapid prototyping runtime environment lacks performance comes processing large amounts data pdas 
re implemented embedded allow visualization medium large information spaces 
user centered design approach help iteratively improve application usability
