system architecture data acquisition currently web applications frameworks designed deal semantic issues described previous section mainly human users analyzing interpreting data 
process solving complex problems requires aggregated information various sources time consuming inconsistent unreliable inconvenient 
need defined interface data repositories web personal data stores undeniable 
information entities associated lifespan stored ontological way established metadata frameworks rdf topic maps facilitate semantic queries life trails processing life events 
information items various kinds documents emails images audio video streams 
step creating repository implement powerful data acquisition module 
basically different types data sources distinguished data acquired automatically stored semantic data store data acquired enriched manually user external data sources invoked needed imported semantic data store third type strict sense data acquisition step 
important understand data repositories reasonable import system typically external fast changing contain huge amounts data highly structured definition 
examples literature databases enterprise information systems databases web search engines 
external sources invoked demand query fitting ontological representation generated plug defined system see 
data import cases performed standardized interface encapsulates data chunks xml message 
message oriented design mod advantage loose coupling means various modules described easily connected controlled central message queue event handler 
message queue performs standard operations adding time stamps specific operations creates logging mechanisms allow analyzing behavior system case problems 
usage mod allows enhancements guarantee scalability flexibility 
analysis module order efficiently extract meta information incoming messages sent analysis interface step 
basically plug mechanism allows adding various analysis modules pre process messages certain types 
analysis steps meta data generated added message 
depending message type analysis module invoked processing particular message 
important understand point data removed analysis steps 
desired guarantee original data lost modified history changes preserved 
allows re processing data semantic store case powerful analysis modules available 
mentioned incoming messages may contain information items placed nested manner 
additionally information item information items attached email attachments 
information item information items embedded images audio video clips html pdf file 
consequently information items analyzed nested way extraction meta information available respective headers 
course currently automatic information extraction limited messages data sources provide certain machine readable structures 
example extremely difficult extract structured information description content picture movie 
making manual annotations information items fed system ultimately improve quality 
act complement content analysis automatic metadata extraction described earlier 
analysis steps finished original message generated metadata sent back message queue forwards storage module 
indexing storage storage write module responsible extracting xml metadata information message writes semantic data repository 
reception message event handler steps performed parsing message extraction metadata invoke appropriate plug writing specific ontology framework connector interface updating indices basic consideration regarding storage size storage media continuously increasing possible keep data entered system 
basic feature system allows keeping personal history data semantic viewpoint 
annotating entities metadata building connections related entities crucial feature storage module 
relationships built automatically human intervention leading concept weak strong links respectively 
weak link creation carried periodically related events 
example email objects related senders receivers automatically subjects 
relations criteria user needed 
user retrieve information related information 
possible retrieve trail documents messages pictures 
connections stored system ability refreshing updating automatic semi automatic manner 
updates occur result changes instance values class hierarchy relations classes subclasses kinds properties ontology rules knowledge base 
additionally message event oriented architecture allows solving problems typically active database systems 
trigger mechanisms database react due user defined rules send notification clients

interactive information retrieval search query functionality structured database systems relational object oriented database systems usually provide query mechanisms allow powerful queries highly structured data 
mentioned difficult define highly structured queries language sql multitude information systems addressed information semi structured 
system capable weaker search terminology transformed specific queries system 
data stored semantically enriched metadata added fly invoking external data sources respectively possible provide powerful imprecise searches go far simple full text indices return information user meaningful rich intuitive ways 
term imprecise meanings firstly generated queries undefined targets 
secondly target query specified ambiguity query 
system solve problems query generation exploring system database ontology repository generate queries specific technology 
specific queries ontological query languages topic maps rql rdql rdf 
nested distributed sub queries joins complex subqueries require ordering re ordering query optimization module optimal query execution plan generated 
suitable search algorithms non ontological searches 
generated queries stored possible reuse system optimization 
step query post processing received query output needs analysis ranking derive precise results matched user requests preferences 
analysis ranking rely specific calculations terms semantic distances reasoning steps give concrete accurate results 
perform tasks system refer set rules user preferences 
purpose data internal external data sources taken account 
system keeps complete history entered data post processing needs filter data desired time span problem domain 
analysis ranking query results system aggregate results sending result back encapsulated xml message user presentation application intermediary server prepares search result rendering web browser 
query user interface needs designed way user able write refine queries iterative manner backend supported query engine server 
extensibility persistence information semantic core system analysis metadata extraction capabilities 
new data sources emerge time need treated system 
time consuming task add support newer data sources system tight coupling components 
light weight asynchronous messaging solution required new modules just plugged system change existing code 
furthermore openness extremely important issue considering systems designed lifetime acquisition information metadata 
project developed open source license allows various groups developers users enhance maintain system 
module evaluated open standards exist representation data semantics data exchange 
client interaction 
architecture framework messaging interface provides standardized communication mechanism various types clients described 
current prototypical implementations system oriented individual users 
clear server versions need implemented multiuser systems 
encouraging task arising problems mainly typical problems multi user server systems 
focus treatment semantically enriched information brief discussion issues 
user management authentication requirements need implemented server system 
consequence message keep information user performs query example 
sensitive processing units mainly storage search module filter messages query results user rights roles defined user 
probably ontology stored server 
user module additionally maintain profiles various types users devices applications tasks interaction objects
