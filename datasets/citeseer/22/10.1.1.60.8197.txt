topographic torch interaction model topographic torch handheld tool consisting ipaq pda personal digital assistant running custom developed software 
users map pda screen 
map centered location user standing world point 
map initially displayed level zoom streets street names readily identified 
user press buttons adjust sliders interact map 
movement explorations map controlled separate related ways 
ways moving map pointing tilting 
moving map user able see different parts map viewport pda screen 
pointing topographic torch user holds pda screen reasonably parallel surface earth 
user points pda direction north south east west 
causes map automatically rotate point user located world point 
rotation stops map properly aligned world 
example user physically points north screen map update show north user line 
topographic torch automatic alignment means users physically mentally rotate maps 
alignment done regards user physical location egocentric frame 
levine alignment principle automatically occurs part fundamental design topographic torch 
tilting tilting pda scrolls screen map backwards forwards direction user pointing line 
scroll forward user tilts device forward scroll backwards user tilts device backwards 
tilted forward pda angled front device closer ground back device away ground 
possible user scroll far back see 
user scroll back located map 
wish see turn point direction 
digital maps pressing left right buttons tilting left right case topographic torch effect cause map scroll left right 
tilting enables users explore parts map physically distant 
tilting implemented topographic torch automatically fulfills levine forward principle 
user sees screen front direction user pointing 
egocentric scrolling interaction model described far important question happen user rotates points different directions region map point displayed screen 
existing mapping tools user expect see directly left right point screen map scroll left right 
case topographic torch scrolling movement map tightly integrated user located world 
user rotation causes viewport initially point traverse circumference circle 
centre circle point user located world radius circle distance point point user tilts forward back radius increases decreases 
example user facing north point rotates approximately degrees right see region map point noted viewport rotates 
viewport maintains tangent circle traversing circumference circle 
maintaining viewport tangent circle scrolling occur top bottom bottom top screen 
top bottom scrolling important maintains levine forward principle user interactions maps 
distant dependent automatic zooming user looks regions map away map automatically zoomed 
see detail overview 
look regions closer closer location map zooms 
see detail overview 
done number reasons 
distant dependent automatic zooming viewed variation speed dependent automatic zooming firstly done try build see objects world 
unable see distant objects clearly see close objects buildings distant objects appear smaller close objects 
dynamically altering scale level detail function distance length attempting influence user sense distance looking secondly user looks parts map away sensitivity pointing increases 
increases length distance traveled degree circle circumference increases 
degree change direction user pointing looking regions map close traverse large amount map 
degree change large causes large amounts map traversed 
large potential negative effects 
slight changes direction user pointing cause large changes shown onscreen kind small physical jitter movement user leads constantly updating unreadable screen display 

user trying explore area point small change pointing angle leads large amount map getting traversed 
hard understand relationship regions map visual scrolling continuation regions 
topographic torch prevent potential issues 
zooming increases rate traversal circumference circle maintained fixed rate movement 
implementation details topographic torch runs ipaq plugged mesh 
mesh hardware platform ipaq captures wide range haptic information 
mesh axis magnetic gyroscopes accelerometers number useful features tactile feedback gps magnetic compass accelerometer carrying tilt compensation establish direction topographic torch pointed 
tilt compensation adjusts magnetic compass data direction magnetic north lost topographic torch tilted 
example tilt traditional magnetic compass compass needle gets stuck provides incorrect directional information 
low pass filtering carried data captured mesh 
reduces jitter introduced users kinesthetic system contributes making display updates smoother 
maps stored bitmaps vector maps better map transforms zooms rotations
