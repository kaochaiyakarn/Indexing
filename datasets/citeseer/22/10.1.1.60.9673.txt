sn 
suggests calculated applying bayes rule candidate answer 
may leave quite candidate explanations long satisfies previous criteria favoring observed state van fraassen claims objective criteria preferring context question implicitly contains information answer receiver prefer 
useful feature van fraassen theory application knowledge systems suggests minimum criteria explanation fulfill favor observed state framework understanding explanations answers contrastive questions 
natural language philosophy field natural language studies focuses explanations process communication people 
goal explanation impart piece knowledge sender recipient 
characterizes request explanation request understanding 
believes request take forms just questions van fraassen number questions 
says explanation intention giving knowledge understand phenomena frame 
van fraassen suggests preference explanations preference defined context conversation ultimately control individual requesting explanation 
example explanation train full high population density area useful passenger train scheduling department useful explanation trains scheduled part city 
view explanations suggests wide variety statements serve explanations 
explanation need example causal chain events leading matter explained 
explanation may goal facilitate formation causal chain recipient need contain explicitly 
supply recipient knowledge needs order infer 
case observing rules communication seen human conversation information obvious communicated 
asks peter perfectly explanation anne sick aware recipient knows peter daughter called anne stay home take care sick 
hand emphasizes value knowing recipient quite suggests form efficient explanations accurate user models may necessary 
hand alleviates requirement put forward complete explanation system reasonable assumptions recipient knows capable 
instance need explain inner workings neural network comparing pictures 
presenting pictures user validate similarity serve explanation 
goal explanation david leake directs attention different goals receiver explanation may 
leake bases theory explanation cognitive psychology explanations roles support claim argument 
suggests explanations constructive contrastive 
schank tradition specifies explanation required foremost anomalous situations person faced situation fit internalized model world 
sounds quite specific explanation situation leake illustrates goals needs actors vary widely 
example focuses situation person gets know unexpected news high taxes foreign competition outdated equipment despite low labor costs 
managers announced decision 
week lay force gives examples different actors different interest news 
news surprising means model situation flawed interested information news order repair models 
different interests range pure disbelief news additional information sought explanation came local politicians want know prevent type situations occurring information role tax level played managers want avoid negative publicity finding external reasons 
actors referring event explanation unexpected situation different 
leake goal driven model takes starting point different interests 
world different expected existing goals plans may reconsidered 
kind information needed purpose explanation actor 
view explanation related natural language philosophy view outlined sense takes recipient frame account 
leake operational view explanations purely descriptive 
deals general communication issues leake focuses evaluation explanations actor user detected model world faulty stated new goals step provide new information explanations assess usefulness 
sense leake theory seen operationalization certain aspects general theory communication

example system prefer questions confirm eliminate possible outcome classes domain 
allow form simple explanations relevance questions user asked 
computer fault domain example relevance question hear fan explained context reported evidence telling user fan heard confirm faulty power cord 
connecting cases general knowledge tutoring cognitive theories learning assume people start learning new domain looking concrete cases episodes 
natural fit case reasoning roots approach theories 
separation cognitive theory cbr basic principle cbr value lazy learning 
just intime approach induction cbr contrasts somewhat cognitive theories believe generalization going new situations experienced 
simply presenting high number examples useful learning domain help learner generalizing lessons 
example currently doing experiments case tutoring system assists year students solving programming exercises 
tutoring system assist student matching program student attempts solving problem displaying part solution 
may help student able see suggested lines program code 
system required provide explanation deeper understanding programming instance explain want repeat number times loop 
suggest may necessary knowledge intensive system fulfill learning goal generalization may done lazily number machine learning algorithms 
cbr strategist pro con systems examples induction presenting explanation user lazily 
cbr strategist system may fairly effective training users skill identifying computer faults 
limitation approach system introduce higher order concepts relate generalized concepts environment outside system 
knowledge intensive systems may contain generalized knowledge human user structuring internal model domain 
allow knowledge intensive systems produce explanations help tying general domain knowledge cases 
example br ashley ibp system model reasoning combined cbr predict outcome legal cases 
done older cases weak domain model produce legal arguments 
systems explanation solution explanation argument complete fulfilling transparency goal order give justification prediction 
argument complex uses problem solving method courts solving cases users lawyers able sense 
systems ibp highly specialized specialization allows focus explanation goals users system combination models cases allows communicate concrete examples generalized structure 
things different theories explanation common context goals influence great deal explanation 
experience intelligent tutoring systems trying understand systems function context 
seen situations explanation goals users fulfilled simply displaying best matched case 
value case explanation dismissed overestimated 
designing cbr system suggest approach explanation goals potential users considered design explanation mechanism 
hard model individual user goals intentions completely designer system assumptions goals capabilities prototypical users system 
believe explicitly formulating explanation goals facilitate discussion possible conflicts goals clear different approaches tend favor different types goals
