original formulation sharedplans henceforth called version meta predicates model plans individual agents groups agents 
meta predicate definitions recursion interleaved existential quantification modal belief operators reasoning sharedplans difficult 
furthermore complex structure sharedplan left implicit 
longer version reformulation sharedplans henceforth called introduces sharedplan trees explicit complex structure sharedplans simplifies reorganizes sharedplan meta predicate definitions sacrificing expressiveness enables conditions specified set important theorems agents sharedplans may proven 
multi agent actions necessarily complex single agent actions basic complex 
single agent groups allowed basic single research supported iri iri cda national science foundation

spt represents information distributed group 
making structure spt explicit easy describe agent view spt specify knowledge conditions concerning agent beliefs contents spt 
addition explicit arguments various meta predicates dramatically reduces need existential quantification
