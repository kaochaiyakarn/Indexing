basic relation ist 
asserts proposition true context important formulas relate propositions true different contexts 
introducing contexts formal objects permit axiomatizations limited contexts expanded transcend original limitations 
necessary provide ai programs logic certain capabilities human fact representation human reasoning possess 
fully implementing transcendence require extensions mathematical logic nonmonotonic inference methods invented ai studied new domain logic 
various notations considered notes tentative proposing single language desired capabilities 
notes contain reasoning proposals mccarthy introduce contexts formal objects 
proposals incomplete tentative 
particular formulas eventually want feel free formulas discussions different applications aren compatible

specialize time context related time specialized value may relation ist specialize time jmc stanford ist time jmc stanford time assertion proposition holds time call lifting relation 
convenient write time foo foo lets drop certain contexts 
expressions better represented modifiers expressed functions predicates functions arguments 
actions give immediate examples slowly foot go go foot slowly 
function specialize time may convenient predicate specializes time axiom specializes time ist oe ist time permit different contexts specialize particular time 
relations concerned specializing places specializing speakers hearers 
relations permit lifting sentences containing pronouns contexts presuming specific places persons 

proposition context assuming context assumed assumed taken natural deduction sense section 
general relation specializes contexts 
say specializes involves assumptions proposition meaningful translatable meaningful 
nonmonotonic relations specializes ab ist oe ist specializes ab ist oe ist gives nonmonotonic inheritance ist subcontext vice versa 
useful case sentences change lifted 
see example 

major set relations need expressed context particular conversation subsequent written report situation conversation took place 
persons objects decontextualized report sentences express relations

transcending contexts human intelligence involves ability undertaken put computer programs ability transcend context beliefs 
objects fall expected thoroughly built human mental structure belief 
long space travel possible possibility contemplated 
wasn easy jules got wrong thought turn point way moon travellers experiencing pull earth suddenly experience pull moon 
fact ability required full intelligence 
need able comprehend discovery discovery 
terminology mccarthy hayes needed epistemological part intelligence leaving aside heuristic 
want regard system time implicit outer context 
sentence program believes qualification regarded equivalent ist program infer ist transcending context 
performing operation give new outer context call gamma process continued indefinitely 
consider continuing process example order sentences refer process successive transcendence 

mechanism described previous paragraph transcendence pointless 
new sentences just elaborate versions old 
point transcendence arises want transcending context relax change assumptions old 
example language adjacency physical objects may implicitly assume gravitational field having relations 
may encapsulated relations context 
transcendence permit relaxing implicit assumptions 
formalism extended provide gamma set sentences true object truths 
transcendence formalism approach formalizing done science philosophy necessary go language certain 
provides way formalizing human ability assertions thoughts 
usefulness transcendence depend suitable collection nonmonotonic rules lifting sentences higher level contexts 
long stay fixed outer context logic remain ordinary order logic 
transcending outermost context require changed logic tarski montague call reflexion principles 
sentences true snow white true snow white 
discussion concerns epistemology transcending contexts 
heuristics transcendence system transcend outer context entirely open subject 
relative quine uses notion eternal sentence essentially doesn depend context 
doubtful idea incompatible quine ideas isn language eternal sentences expressed doesn involve contexts sort 
want modify quine idea 
usefulness eternal sentences comes fact ordinary speech writing involves contexts pronoun valid parts sentences 
consider john mccarthy stanford university stanford today 
phrase stanford senses sentence 
information put say book read years people don know mccarthy stanford information decontextualized extent replacing phrases contextual ones 
way propose eternal sentences called relative 
idea contexts occur discussion common context terms predicates lifted 
sentences context relatively eternal thinking adaptation people programs different presuppositions may result context 
mental states outer contexts person state mind adequately regarded set propositions believes regard propositions sentences give answers questions 
example write believe george bush president united states entering information database write president george bush state mind includes reasons believing referred president today news regard death short interval improbable 
idea tms reason maintenance system keep track pedigrees sentences database keep information auxiliary database usually form sentences 
proposal database consisting entirely outer sentences pedigree inner sentence auxiliary parameter kind modal operator surrounding sentence 
outer sentence believe president george bush dots represent reasons believing bush president 
formalized contexts provides convenient way realizing idea 
outer context sentence reasons asserted 
system committed reasoning proposition bush president enters inner context simpler assertion president system uses assertion bush president reach leaves inner context needs acquire suitable pedigree 
consider belief revision system revises database beliefs solely function new belief introduced old beliefs system 
systems inadequate take account information tms revise beliefs 
turn system outer beliefs adequate consequent revision inner beliefs take reasons account 
short term applications see formalized contexts essential tools reaching human level intelligence logic methods 
see formalized contexts having shorter term applications 
ffl guha put contexts cyc largely form microtheories

ffl suppose air force general electric databases include prices jet engines associated equipment 
items overlap jet engines general electric sells air force included 
suppose databases entirely compatible prices different assumptions spare parts warranty conditions 
suppose databases program check air force database date general electric prices 
idea corresponding database context engine prices context af engine prices 
program context may call context ge af engine prices 
language allows statements auxiliary information included price item 
suitable lifting rules allow translating sentences databases comprehensive context 
remarks 
mentioned various ways getting new contexts old ones specializing time place specializing situation making abbreviations specializing subject matter legal history making assumptions specializing context conversation 
specializations kind 
getting new context transcending old context dropping assumption gravitational field gives rise new class ways getting new contexts 
ways getting new contexts treated separately 

natural language examples article natural language main concern 
hope formalizing context ways propose may useful studying semantics natural language 
natural language exhibits striking phenomenon context may vary small scale contexts may occur single sentence 
consider context operation surgeon says scalpel
