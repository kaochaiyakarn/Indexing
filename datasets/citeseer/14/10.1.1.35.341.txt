briefly mention notion capabilities takes account skills compatibility goals intentions constraints recipes detailed discussion algorithm refer skills 
recipe needs communicated 
recipes partial allowing delayed specification agent time action partiality decomposition constituent actions 
major emphasis examination role communication assisting collaboration 
particular jennings ran experiments comparing performance system responsibility model alternatives utilize explicit model joint intention 
experiments focused execution phase collaborative activity benefits communicating group agent carry actions committed doing part group activity 
results suggest communication lessens wasted 
jennings argues explicit model collaboration enables savings system designer needing determine advance problems arise execution information needs communicated 
provide account collaborative activity searle introduced notion intention 
grosz sidner grosz sidner argued notion necessary initial formulation sharedplans avoids 
definitions provided formulation accommodate group activity directly decomposed actions individual agents 
provided formalization handles complex actions allows plans partial 
sharedplans serve major roles 
summarize set beliefs intentions needed collaborative activity provide rationale process revising beliefs intentions 
consequently motivate collaborative correlate means ends reasoning plans individual agent 
sharedplans ground individual intentions individual agents individual plans engender 
formalization accommodates properties shared cooperative activity proposed bratman 
intentions constituent actions form basis individual actions 
intentions directed agents abilities act success acting success joint activity ensure meshing subplans helpful behavior 
development formalization uncovered interesting new problems designing agents collaborative 
include 
need develop flexible methods reasoning resources resource conflicts context collaborative activity examine tradeoffs 

need develop complex methods groups construct agree recipes 

need understand fully ways communication supports collaboration develop complete set communication axioms 
agents need communicate completion subtasks errors situations alternative approaches cf 
section built need communicate 
instance communication actions play central role establishing requisite mutual beliefs ensuring satisfaction intentions 
formalization aspects collaborative planning 
plan definitions entail reasoning mechanisms individual agents utilize elaborating partial plans certain properties complete specification elaboration processes provided 
second formalization includes basic axioms attitude intending int th modal operator 
third provide specific mechanisms reconciling intentions 
addition formalize commitment 
issue enormous right relevant sharedplans way affects development procedures reconciling intentions 
poses significant research problem left research 
major steps envision develop strategies protocols elaborating partial plans including mechanisms combining information possessed different agents perform complex action strategies negotiating competing approaches handling resource conflicts reaching consensus allocate portions activity different participants
