cellular communications cloning fraud cellular phone periodically transmits unique identification numbers mobile identification number min electronic serial number esn 
numbers specify customer account 
numbers broadcast unencrypted received decoded stored special equipment relatively inexpensive 

cloning fraud cloning occurs customer min esn programmed cellular telephone belonging customer 
second telephone network sees customer min esn subsequently bills usage customer 
stolen min esn cloned phone user shall call bandit virtually unlimited calls charges customer 
attraction free untraceable communication cloned phones popular major metropolitan areas 
fraudulent usage goes undetected customer bill include corresponding charges 
typically customer calls cellular service provider carrier denies usage 
carrier customer determine calls bandit legitimate calls 
fraudulent charges credited customer account measures taken prohibit fraudulent charges 
certain cases fraudulent call records referred law enforcement agency 
primary motivations cloning fraud 
obviously cloning fraud allows low cost communications 
bandit charged calls usually worth far retail dollars cost cloned phone 
obviously cloning fraud allows untraceable communications bandit identity tied cloned account 
second aspect important criminals 
cloning fraud detrimental ways 
fraudulent usage cell sites causing service denied legitimate customers 
second cellular calls non cellular destinations fraud incurs land line usage charges 
third cellular carriers pay costs carriers usage outside home territory 
adaptive fraud detection retail costs constitute considerable financial burden customer carrier 
fourth process costly carrier inconvenient customer customer switch carrier customer churn perceived susceptible fraud 
reasons cellular carriers strong interest reducing cloning fraud 

strategies dealing cloning fraud classes methods dealing cloning fraud 
pre call methods try identify block fraudulent calls 
post call methods try identify fraud occurred account fraudulent usage blocked 

pre call methods pre call detection methods involve validating phone user call placed 
common method requiring personal identification number pin entered call 
pin serves password validated switch prior allowing call network 
pins metropolitan areas united states 
unfortunately min esn pairs pins broadcast unencrypted 
technical reasons pins difficult receive decode sophisticated equipment pin cracking possible herzog 
pins cloning fraud difficult prevent 
methods prevention include rf fingerprinting authentication 
rf fingerprinting method identifying cellular phones transmission characteristics 
authentication reliable secure private key encryption method imposes inconvenience customer 
predicted authentication eliminate cloning fraud eventually 
authentication requires changes hardware phones switches capable processing authentication requests 
currently cell phones united states replacement immediate steward 
cloning fraud continue problem industry rely post call fraud detection methods 

post call methods post call methods periodically analyze call data account determine cloning fraud occurred 
method collision detection involves analyzing call data temporally overlapping calls 
min esn pair licensed legitimate user simultaneous usage probably fraudulent 
closely related method velocity checking davis goyal involves analyzing locations times consecutive calls determine single user placed traveling reasonable speeds
