index terms content image search retrieval relevance feedback multimedia database systems digital image processing 

amount audiovisual information available digital format grown dramatically years 
gigabytes new images audio video clips generated stored everyday helping build huge distributed unstructured repository multimedia information accessed internet 
digitization compression archival multimedia information popular inexpensive straightforward broad range available hardware software support tasks 
subsequent retrieval stored information require considerable additional order effective efficient 
cases free browsing tedious inefficient time consuming completely unfeasible 
retrieval problems considerable amount time effort needed manually annotate individual image clip imprecision associated subjective human perception contents annotated 
order overcome inefficiencies limitations text retrieval previously annotated multimedia data researchers image processing computer vision community working systems techniques allow retrieval multimedia information particularly images video clips solely visual contents color texture objects shape movement
