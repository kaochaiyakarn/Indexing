section introduce formal setting associated graph operations 
graph oriented model 
formally ontology represented directed labeled graph nite set labeled nodes nite set labeled edges 
edge written members label edge 
label node function maps node non null string 
context ontologies label maps noun phrase represents concept 
label edge string 
string attached edge relates verb natural language pre de ned semantic relationship 
domain functions universal set nodes graphs range set strings lexicons 
example running example elicits graphical structure envisioned 
composition independent graphs provides ontological context 
semantic model sources built relationships instanceof subclassof commonly literature 
graph patterns 
manipulate ontology graphs need identify portions graphs interest concise manner 
graph patterns purpose 
de ne pattern graph matches subgraph apart structural match labels corresponding nodes edges identical 
formally graph said match exists total mapping function 


practice apart strict match described domain interoperation expert de ne versions fuzzy matching 
example expert indicate set synonyms provide rule relax rst condition enable nodes match exact label synonyms de ned expert 
alternatively second condition requires edges label may strictly enforced 
onion toolkit patterns identi ed direct manipulation graph representation 
textual interface simple notation curly brackets denote hierarchical objects 
variables indicated bounded terms 
example possible patterns transportation world carrier car driver truck owner model 
partially speci es pattern carrier ontology consists node car outgoing edge node driver 
refers node labelled truck attributes owner model variable binds truck owner object 
space limitations prohibit expose query facilities patterns 
refer interested readers papers semi structured query languages 
graph transformation primitives

addition nodes edges generating articulation 
deletion required updating articulation response changes underlying ontologies

ontology terms patterns articulation graph oa built structures taken underlying sources maintains information regarding relationships exist 
oa constructed interactive guidance domain expert deployment general articulation rules drawn knowledge base 
articulation rules take form complex graph patterns

rules con ned describing bridging ontologies structure individual source ontologies articulation ontology graph 
likewise notational convenience multi term implication broken inference engine multiple atomic rules 
example 
rule transport owner transport erson results addition edge articulation ontology graph transport indicating class owner subclass class erson 
conjunction disjunction 
operands semantic implication generalized encompass graph pattern predicates 
translation onion data layer amounts introducing node represent subclass derived target semantic implication 
examples suce illustrate approach taken 
example compound rule factory factory carrier modeled adding node represents vehicles carry cargo articulation ontology 
default label predicate text overruled user concise appropriate name semantic class involved 
example introduce node labeled edges indicate subclass classes 
furthermore subclasses subclasses subclasses 
intuitive vehicle carries cargo goods vehicle 
articulation rules involve disjunction terms factory carrier cars carrier modeled adding new node articulation ontology labelled edges indicate classes carrier cars carrier factory subclasses transport 
intuitively introduced term class vehicles cars trucks term implies subclass 
inference engines full rst order systems tend scale large knowledge bases performance reasons envisage lot applications simple horn clauses represent articulation rules 
modular design onion system implies plug lighter faster inference engine 
functional rules di erent ontologies contain terms represent concept expressed di erent metric space 
normalization functions take set input perform desired conversion written standard programming language provided expert 
scope generation functions semi automatically 
example 
price cars expressed terms dutch pound sterling need normalized respect say euro integrated 
choice euro normalized currency expert politician 
expect expert supply functions perform conversions ways dutch euro back 
ontology graphs rules carrier transport euro create edge carrier transport euro articulation ontology carrier
