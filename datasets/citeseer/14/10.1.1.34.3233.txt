syskill webert selects informative quinlan lewis words features words occur greater proportion hot training documents cold vice versa 
represented set boolean features variety machine learning information filtering algorithm create user profile 
publicly available version syskill webert uses standard machine learning algorithm bayesian classifier create probabilistic profile 
profile contains estimated prior probability page hot cold informative feature conditional probability page contains doesn contain word page hot cold 
algorithm selected experimentally accurate task desirable time space complexity linear number examples features estimates probability page interesting user particular topic 
probability may rank unseen pages 
probability may decide recommend page user 
selecting threshold probability possible trade precision recall

closer integration search engine syskill webert considerable overhead retrieving page order rank effectively eliminated 
experiments having fewer features reduces accuracy predications little difference intermediate values
