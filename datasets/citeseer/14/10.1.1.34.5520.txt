general new flexibility internet gives telephony allows wide range new possibilities flexibility introduces new challenges 
advantages internet telephony advantages internet telephony broadly divided categories discuss detail subsequent sections 
section summarize advantages arise due design internet telephony protocols 
opportunity design protocols scratch number difficulties traditional networks avoided altering underlying protocol architecture 
secondly section lists advantages arise infrastructure internet 
internet developed past decades support wide variety types services leveraged provide powerful new abilities telephony environment 
section attributes internet technical conceptual developments social commercial evolution internet substantially different pstn difference carries social commercial environment internet telephony 
protocol issues internet telephony signaling protocols significantly expressive pstn 
particularly true compared limited signaling tones hook signals available wire analog telephones 
rich signaling internet telephony eliminates previous limitations feature development 
example system longer needs indicate desire transfer call elaborate sequence tones explicitly indicate partner party call transfered 
furthermore internet telephony signaling extensible extended maintaining compatibility 
new signaling properties events invented added existing protocol ways interoperate cleanly existing implementations providing richer information signaling information allowing fine grained control features required understood order understand signaling message successfully 
internet telephony devices query determine properties parameters support 
new signaling elements capabilities developed network able evolve gracefully support advanced features needing undergo painful universal upgrades entire system 
past difficulties arisen particular trying add new kinds signaling capability voice mail control 
analog systems isdn signaling carried user user elements existing signaling messages 
internet context adding control protocol example rtsp voice mail presence protocol done independently telephony signaling protocol 
internet telephony enables creation new services integrate telephone services existing internet protocols services 
internet telephony addresses urls internet telephony protocols designed forwarding transferring call mail address web page conceptually different forwarding transferring telephone 
similarly signaling request carry arbitrary payload body media type carried mime payload description mechanism web mail carried internet telephony request 
addition real time communications streams internet telephony sessions encompass traditional multimedia audio video limited types communications 
internet telephony signaling protocols separate type event session instance description stream possible protocols invite instance multi player game simultaneously invite game voice communication 
major difference internet telephony protocols pstn isdn networks protocols user device uses talk network user network interface uni protocols network devices network network interfaces talk identical 
internet telephony strong distinction user devices network devices device sending request typically aware need aware communicating signaling server system 
unification internet telephony deployment scale individuals running systems giant organization providing elaborate services user location features organizations interoperate cleanly 
means customer large provider choose bypass provider current needs don require services simplicity flexibility reliability privacy reasons users choose communicate directly intermediate servers need modify systems 
internet telephony protocols allow capability labeling systems 
traditional networks encounters problem voice caller accidentally reaching fax machine modem vice versa 
internet telephony contrast prevents ways media type specifications voice fax differ voice system immediately reject call unsupported media type error 
broader scale system identify type communication supports caller searching destination specify type communication desired call network devices automatically resolve prevent incompatible calls 
internet model eliminates user level address scarcity 
sip mail style identifiers telephone addresses practically infinite numbers internet telephony identifiers created organization possesses dns domain 
pstn telephone numbers contrast scarce resource obtaining throw away addresses generally possible numbers certain geographic exhausted expensive intrusive re numbering usually required 
lack address scarcity number important secondary consequences 
telephone numbers just identifiers telephone points overloaded indicate variety network system properties 
numbers refer user device connection switch distribution point complex service phone bank 
circumstances indicate carrier se lection party paying regions device fixed line device mobile phone pager 
internet telephony addresses cheap overloading separated eliminated 
possible resident house address maintain separate addresses general reachability role home instance device owns addresses assigned dynamically temporary discarded imposing burden network numbering plan single telephone number 
network issues nature internet engenders number advantages internet telephony traditional circuit switched telephone networks 
nature circuit switched networks enable communication huge numbers people require sort parallel signaling mechanism enables circuits established 
communication channels constantly maintained pair stations wish communicate parallel mechanism self routed originating node specifies destination signaling request network sees request arrives destination circuit established process takes place 
internet inherently self routing 
signaling media sent network mechanism need parallel infrastructures maintained 
additionally nature internet paths signaling media traverse network widely disparate 
pstn signaling media travel separate routes architecture network requires types data traverse administrative domains 
internet contrast routes signaling media traverse entirely disparate points paths need 
media packets normally sent traveling natural route internet low level routing protocols established endpoints signaling travel servers provide elaborate third party services 
ip entirely packet media communication limited single communications channel circuit switched network 
internet telephony appropriate environment low bitrate speech encodings high bandwidth video 
multiple media sessions single call media sessions inherently multiplex communications channel endpoints 
bandwidth usage vary dynamically call depending network conditions systems stepping lower bandwidth encoding network loaded restoring higher quality resources available 
furthermore ip supports network level multicast protocols requiring applicationlevel devices bridges 
enables number features signaling media levels 
signaling level possible support number features reach member group needing server distribute request explicitly 
interestingly media multicast allows multi party conferences established bandwidth efficient way need conference bridge transition multi party telephone calls large scale conferences seamlessly distinction necessary 
internet environment supports number means strong encryption authentication ipsec suite protocols 
tools secure communications reliably guarantee false information injected systems 
sophisticated algorithms design techniques developed years fields computer network security advantage increases processing power communications secure eavesdroppers manners possible 
security pstn contrast relies physical security network cables equipment generally expensive accomplish reliable long run 
conceptual issues conceptual framework internet services gives rise number new characteristics internet telephony environment 
pstn gradually moving increasingly distributed environment multiple providers compete fine grained level internet level shows signs moving away 
services provided third parties organizations dedicated providing services intention providing actual voice multimedia transport easily original provider providers may specialize service provision data transport separate tasks 
broadly distributed environment introduces new possibilities terms trust models internet telephony 
relatively easy internet telephony customer proxy calls service example automatically blocks calls known 
traditional telephone interest providing service customers trust telephone provide reliably calls provide revenue 
distributed network allows users trust relationships organizations service provider 
additionally internet environment enables programmability scale seen telephone network 
precedent web services see internet distributed nature give rise programmability scale unprecedented pstn networks 
causes 
rich communications media sophisticated processing possible low users allow complex feature descriptions passed real time 
example call processing language developing allow users design upload scripts network signaling servers 
real time control pstn services contrast generally terribly powerful user typically best set single parameter turn feature 
user specifying features line provider usually checklist possible features available sophisticated controls allow loops branches user settable timers possible 
wide variety providers available fact users able provider services regardless data connections come give service providers strong motivation create services distinguish competitors 
single standardized list enumerated features customers choose give service providers distinguish pack envision providers quickly develop sophisticated distinctive features 
new complications new features internet introduce significant number additional complications problem creating deploying features resolving interactions 
problems flip side new features described previous section new characteristics internet enable new possibilities increase complexity creating features 
significant new complications distributed nature internet 
features implemented deployed numerous network devices systems signaling servers 
systems may controlled entirely separate organizations may unaware competing generally inclined operate resolve feature interactions 
additionally user programmability possible new phenomenon features created amateur feature designers arises 
new services created deployed level ease example web services created today simple service put reasonably experienced programmer matter hours may created programmers may consider feature interaction issues thoroughly ignorance 
distributed problems may dismissed just customers feature designers unfortunately service providers inter operate services 
network level characteristics internet introduce new complications 
fact media packets travel intermediate servers means intermediate servers longer implement number features transparently 
instance ordinary signaling servers listen calls collect digits press new call significantly perform pipe bending services intermediate system moves endpoint call system example transfer call explicitly informing systems new locations send media packets 
related complication fact systems control call state 
introduces new possibilities general feature creation deployment complicates issues situations network wants able impose control contrary expressed desires system 
example traditional telephone networks emergency calls usually handled specially systems hang emergency operator hang call line cleared 
system controls states impossible network enforce system cooperation 
new features internet telephony protocols potential dramatic feature interaction consequences existing protocols 
probably dramatic known forking proxy 
signaling server proxy server take existing call request transmit parallel devices 
discuss examples complex interactions occur feature section 
new feature request expiration 
request placed specify long considered valid user want call ring equivalent rings example services subsequent signaling servers may programmed different things expiration time elapses 
internet lack address scarcity complicate common features 
traditional telephone networks telephone numbers difficult obtain telephone number reasonably effectively representative party identity purposes incoming outgoing call screening 
internet throw away addresses easy wishing evade block address switch minimal effort 
related problem internet trust model 
pstn telephone users generally assume trust telephone provide accurate information telephone reveal private information third parties ate wire leading house connects telephone 
telephone carriers assume signals get subscriber line coming subscriber signals get telephone companies reliable secure 
assumptions break connectivity introduced anybody internet service provider 
forging communications relatively straightforward packets may sent location network intercepting somewhat difficult significantly tractable telephone network due internet characteristics shared bandwidth communications channels dynamic routing protocols 
protocols strong authentication encryption developed deployment key infrastructure enable large scale trust long way additionally features caller blocking difficult users trust network reveal calling information recipients reliably distinguish communicating network recipient applicability existing feature interaction existing feature interactions applicable internet environment circumstances 
consider framework cameron single component interactions interacting features implemented network component largely internet environment traditional telephone networks expect techniques developed resolve interactions new environment 
example single component interaction dealt internet pstn cameron example interaction call waiting answer call 
features conflicting definitions occur call attempts reach busy line signal user tone connect calling party answering service respectively 
internet telephony environment services deployed device multiple devices controlled organization techniques resolving interaction carry naturally pstn 
multiple component interactions complicated internet telephony 
problem arises features designed deployed providers cooperate interest doing feature interaction resolution techniques depend able describe features globally resolve interactions time designed longer practically applicable 
course growing problem pstn increasing numbers providers enter market 
examples new interactions internet telephony varieties new feature interactions appear internet telephony appear severe traditional telephone networks 
categorize types interactions cooperative interactions parties implement features consider actions reasonable prefer avoid addition existing user level certification services simply assure presenter signed request reached email address indicated associate legal civil identity key 
interaction possible 
adversarial interactions contrast parties involved call conflicting desires trying subvert features 
roughly cooperative interactions correspond describes multiple component interactions adversarial interactions commonly multiple user multiple component customer system interactions 
cooperative interactions cooperative feature interactions multiple component feature interactions components share common goal typically allowing caller communicate intended called party different uncoordinated ways achieving goal 
conflicting implementations interact ways prevent desirable means communication occurring possible state parties involved result surprising unpredictable consequences deployed services 
example request forking call forward voicemail request forking allows internet telephony proxy server attempt locate user forwarding request multiple destinations call connected destination pick call attempt canceled 
interaction arises user reached currently located calls forwarded voicemail system 
call picked automated system connect call cancel call caller able reach actual human 
example multiple expiration timers sip request may specify length time request valid 
difficulties arise servers programmed special behavior timeout elapses call definitively accepted rejected 
example proxy server may programmed forward call voicemail server expiration elapsed server may respond web page describing giving alternate ways contacting destination 
earlier call path server considers server response definitive response call response arrives timer expires forward response back original caller triggering expiration behavior 
timers nominal expiration period length time specified request executes depends factors processing time precision servers clocks 
race condition expiration related services executed 
example camp call forward busy camp allows caller reaches busy destination continue re try destination periodically line free 
destination call forward busy call forwarded alternate destination case caller receives busy indication way trigger camp service 
interaction arise pstn serious internet telephony reasons 
internet telephony places additional power call state knowledge systems call forward busy triggered intelligent services implemented system may aware party attempting camp 
pstn switches try camp generally location call forward busy implemented resolve interaction locally 
furthermore camp services internet generally need globally usable users accept camp services provider network state shared easily servers private manner 
adversarial interactions adversarial feature interactions contrast parties involved caller destination endpoint administrator disagree having call typically allowed completed 
difficult resolve reliably cooperative interactions generally parties attempting subvert find ways lie bypass 
complicated users generally quite upset network allows expectations security privacy violated 
example outgoing call screening call forwarding outgoing call screening blocks calls originating party address call placed 
call screening service blocks calls address signaling server downstream location blocked imposed may forward calls originally directed non blocked address blocked address interaction appears pstn course description largely taken ability easily change addresses get easy call forwarding internet problem significant internet environment 
example outgoing call screening connectivity internet provides connectivity enforcement outgoing call screening policy difficult reason 
signaling server force calls placed internet telephony uni protocols identical device talk system programmed communicate directly remote party bypassing local administrative controls entirely 
example incoming call screening polymorphic identity incoming call screening allows called party signaling server system reject calls certain callers automatically 
internet telephony addresses cheap caller switch identity presents call request easily alter address presents order evade screening lists destination programmed phone reject 
example incoming call screening anonymity absence malicious caller incoming call screening complicated caller legitimate desire anonymity 
trust model internet allow user sure network provider hide information caller id user wishes anonymous avoid sending identifying information signaling information place assured anonymity anonymizing server run trusted third party hide information including sender ip address transmission media packets signaling 
pstn destination switch easily apply incoming call screening caller blocking services simultaneously caller destination trust switch apply service reliably 
internet telephony generally mutually trusted third parties anonymous calls critical information simply network 
reliable way screen anonymized calls simply rejecting 
new approaches managing internet interactions internet telephony brings new feature interactions presents new possibilities managing resolving interactions 
flexibility signaling protocols underlying infrastructure internet exploited resolve prevent interactions manner maintains extends powerful new characteristics internet telephony architecture 
explicitness interactions categorized cooperative prevented making explicit actions taken desired effects 
internet telephony protocols extensible possible add parameters tell downstream servers actual actions desired parameters currently standardized 
call intended reach human instance possible specify call forwarded station registered voicemail attribute intelligent services forward call voicemail know return currently available status code 
similarly call wishing camp actual user contacted specify forward get back busy response call forwarded wishes 
difficulty solution complicate creation services significantly service creators need determine wish determine actions compatible preferences caller specified call 
explicitness requires receiver know attributes caller desires call may specify want reach family recipient able useful recognized category 
universal authentication problems introduced polymorphic identities identity forging resolved insisting strong authentication requests 
generic address easily thrown away user claim barrier obtaining certificates giving actual signed identity information higher presumably widely trusted certification authorities relied sufficiently consistent identification users call screening services information block callers 
unfortunately infrastructure fails users accept non authenticated calls authentication far sufficiently widespread practical accept authenticated ones 
hope growth internet telephony help driving force widespread authentication widely deployed internet 
network level administrative restriction administrative restrictions internet generally reliably applied application level 
users connectivity available generally possible prevent advantage connectivity imposing restrictions solely application layer 
network layer administrative restrictions firewalls limit connectivity order impose administrative controls restrictions advantage automatically apply internet services just limited subset 
network level application level restrictions concert instance internet telephony signaling server decided allow call instruct firewall open appropriate ports allow media associated call flow 
verification testing direct way ensuring correct operation features test directly 
third parties establish services automatically request place calls various parameters conditions enabled allow confirm explicitly features way desire 
providers gain experience sorts conditions cause problems services expand suites testing tools cover esoteric interaction conditions 
possible verify features resolve interactions real environment deployed attempting analyze categorize possible consequences feature 
feature interactions internet telephony serious issue feature developers need consider develop services new environment 
temptation internet telephony re invents telephone network discard lessons learned experience traditional networks clear feature creation internet learn prior experience creation telephony services 
lessons learned problems feature interaction manageable dealt efficiently 
architecture internet feature interaction management techniques developed traditional circuit switched networks impractical 
distributed nature feature creation particular means generally possible describe features globally designing implementing 
internet new techniques dealing interactions possible
