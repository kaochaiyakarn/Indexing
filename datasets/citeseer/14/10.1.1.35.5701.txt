implementation simplicity 
construction color histogram straightforward process including scanning image assigning color values resolution histogram building histogram color components indices 
computational simplicity 
histogram computation complexity images size complexity single image match linear represents number different colors resolution histogram 
low storage requirements 
color histogram size significantly smaller image assuming color quantisation 
texture common extension color feature extraction add textural information

circular occurrence matrix modified version standard occurrence method developed produce texture histogram additional degree rotation invariance 
general texture feature extraction tends provide spatial information color histograms

histogram matching process iteratively shift histogram find best match 
important consideration edge maps thresholded unspecified means 
robustness adaptive thresholding scheme 
alternative include edges weight contribution histogram magnitudes reduce contribution spurious edges 
approach take reported experiments 
multi resolution salience distance transform
