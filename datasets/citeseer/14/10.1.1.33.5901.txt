communications acm contend virtual patient record form basis collaboratory environment multiple physicians ultimately patient able engage interactive electronic discussion 
requires support full transaction processing necessary support multiple users browsing possibly editing patient record simultaneously 
explain architecture enables realtime consultations support synchronous offline sessions 
believe collaboratory capability robust potential widespread example simple realtime video teleconferencing 
fact approach provides great enhancement typical video consult providing real time full medical record patient 
including patients allowing access data post reports queries patients better educated empowered manage health 
high degree complexity health care data information intensive aspects health care delivery collaboratory architectural features essential virtual patient records 
architecture supports collaboratory consultations local region serve basis electronic consultations international borders 
kind architecture described designed break typical pattern fragmented care delivered scattered locations focusing mainly single encounter primarily serving privileged populations 
collaborating number organizations help standardize electronic management patient information advanced information technologies form seamless international continuum quality health care 
international implications ubiquitous adoption standards provides foundation internet web possible 
adopting similar international standards virtual patient records day may soon come electronic medical records securely cross international borders

health care quality depends continuity care longitudinal records provide people cross international borders lives expressed purpose seeking health care outside country 
highly intensive monitoring collecting mining health data international level better support public policy decisions 
additional information derived international datamining quickly discover analyze associations diseases study disease distributions geographic regions
