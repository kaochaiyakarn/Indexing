driver scheduling problem process driver scheduling construction set legal shifts including overtime portions allowed cover blocks particular vehicle schedule schedule vehicles may reflect operation organisation self contained part operation 
problem generally known run cutting north america referred crew scheduling 
blocks may considered divided units start finish relief opportunities vehicles pass agreed change points 
successive units block may form portion driver shift shift may cover portions blocks efficiency lost drivers change blocks unnecessarily 
driver scheduling methodology readily extensible situations person assigned vehicle crew subject similar rules may scheduled separate schedules produced different crew members 
driver scheduling subject set rules specific organisation 
rules generally mixtures national local rules may unwritten may soft rules may broken cases 
typically restrictions total time worked length time may worked meal break total duration shift 
nature rules profound effect ease schedule may compiled computer relatively primitive systems developed particular circumstances applied severely constrained situations 
rules relating position meal break shift noteworthy respect 
general manual schedulers computer systems find difficult compile efficient shifts maximum time may worked break short existence tight constraint time may help certain scheduling systems reducing number potential legal shifts 
developed countries labour laws require meal break maximum period half half hours 
european community complex set rules provide single break minutes shorter breaks shorter breaks shift formal breaks provided cumulative slack time certain requirements 
despite bus companies europe obey local rules stipulating provision meal break 
major computer scheduling systems necessarily incorporate sophisticated techniques designed ensure efficient provision breaks 
formal break incorporated driver scheduling process may identify different possibilities 
break required 
natural slack bus schedule shift cut break block automatically satisfy legal requirements 
breaks built bus schedule formation blocks long block includes periods idle time generally mid morning early evening driver may take 
circumstances driver scheduling simply process cutting shifts hours long block combining short blocks outstanding portions form shifts buses 
process generally simple formed basis relatively primitive scheduling systems 
systems series workshops may proceedings omitted reasons space survey 
worth mentioning bus companies especially operations return major bus stations claim schedule vehicles drivers simultaneously building blocks half blocks satisfy rules shifts 
cases valid systematic approach generally construct efficient blocks regard shifts compile conventional schedule shifts redesign blocks follow shifts 
systems example ryan designed explicitly build shifts directly units bus 
shifts straight break short break hour satisfy rules called straight shifts 
bus companies allow split shifts consisting spells usually centred peak periods separated gap hours 
shifts assist covering peaks covering periods peaks assist maintaining service shifts meal breaks
