push pop 
content context dependent representation partly encoded parameters outside box partly sentences inside box 
authors propose reasoning mechanisms altering balance explicitly encoded inside box left implicit encoded parameters 
intuitively idea move information collection parameters outside box representation inside box vice versa 
call mechanisms push pop suggest partial analogy operations adding pushing extracting popping elements stack analogy entail order parameters 
direction push adds contextual parameter collection outside box produces flow information inside outside box part explicitly encoded representation encoded parameter 
opposite direction pop removes contextual parameter collection outside box produces flow information outside inside information encoded parameter explicitly represented inside box 
consider instance example

push reasoning mechanism allows move left right arrow pop reasoning mechanism allows move back right left arrow 
push pop capture interplay collection parameters outside box representation inside box
