photofinder project initial stages project storage retrieval personal photo libraries www cs umd edu hcil emphasize collection management annotation support searching people 
decision user needs assessment reports researchers personal experience indicate people want find photos friend relative event occurred years ago 
personal photo libraries may hundreds tens thousands photos organization generous haphazard 
photos neat albums put drawer shoebox 
photos top shuffling photos leaves disorganized 
users keep photos envelopes got photo store organized types label order 
digital cameras widespread users organization strategies hierarchical directory structures typing descriptive file directory names replace automatically generated photo file numbers 
software packages enable users organize photos albums create web pages photos annotation impossible difficult 
web sites kodak com com enable users store collections photos discussion groups collections annotation limited typing field 
pioneering effort offered excellent prototype inspired 
goal photofinder project support personal photo library users 
developed conceptual model library having set collections collection having set photos 
photos participate multiple collections 
collections individual photos annotated free text fields plus date location fields stored database see photo library database schema 
interface main windows library viewer shows representative photo collection stack representing number photos collection 
collection viewer shows thumbnails photos collection 
users move photos enlarge individually cluster compact manner 
variety thumbnail designs prototyped refined inclusion versions 
photo viewer shows individual photo window 
group photos selected collection viewer dragged photo viewer produce animated slide show 
put strong emphasis recording searching names people photo 
believed personal photo library contain repeated images people different events estimated identifiable people photos 
furthermore expected highly skewed distribution immediate family members close friends appearing frequently 
relationship photos people mediated appearance relation stores identification people appear photo 
database support accurate storage information recognized tedious data entry problem prevent users typing names photo 
furthermore inconsistency names quickly problem misspellings variant names example bill billy william success search 
second challenge faced list names people appearing photo difficult associate individuals especially group shots 
textual captions indicate left right ordering front back rows give specific identification 

photofinder display library viewer left collection viewer thumbnails upper right photo viewer lower right 

direct annotation cope challenges developed concept direct annotation selectable labels placed directly photo 
users select scrolling pop list drag mouse touch screen 
applies direct manipulation principles avoid keyboard enter name time appears 
name labels moved hidden presence recorded database appearance relation location origin upper left hand corner photo 
simple rapid process allows users annotate 
add annotations see photos screen review selections showing 
easy design continuous annotation facility may encourage users annotation 
figures show process annotation set people conference 
initial state select name dragging dropped identified people hide annotations 
process dragging dropping annotation photo selection list shown alphabetically organized scrolling menu implemented split menu 
entail having commonly occurring names box followed alphabetical presentation full list 
frequent names visible allow rapid selection 
name completion strategies rapid table navigation useful application 
users mouse name dragging begins colored box surrounds name 
users mouse name label fixed place tone sounded database entry xy coordinates stored 
tone gives feedback reinforces sense accomplishment 
reinforcement annotation subtly changing border photos collection viewer 
photo gets annotation thumbnail white border changes green 
users able see accomplished photos need annotation 
show hide checkbox gives users control seeing photo name labels 
photo viewer window position labels changes sure remain person 
small marker pixels long hangs center label allow precise placement people close 
marker point head body especially useful crowded group photos 
additions include capacity resize labels change fonts change colors add animations 
interesting issue collaborative annotation multiple users working side side independently annotate photos results combined appropriate resolution conflicts 
tools finding variant spellings switches names help raise data quality 
valuable accelerator bulk annotation group photos selected label applied photo action individual placement needed 
course annotation names people photos step 
drag drop annotation kind object photo car house bicycle map cities states lakes painting signature feature possible 
annotation image type photo portrait group landscape map highway topographic urban painting portrait possible 
colored ribbons multiple star icons indicate importance quality photos 
searching browsing effective annotations included photo database 
obvious task see photos include individual 
implemented simply dragging name list collection viewer designated label area 
photofinder finds displays photos name appears label 

database design implementation schema photo library database photofinder operates photo library database microsoft access contains linked tables 
basic concept photo library contains collections photos photos contain images people 
photo library schema collections table represents collections photos attributes collection title description keywords starting date date location representative unique collection id photos table full path file name photos thumbnails stored important attributes date photo event keywords location rating color locale 
photo unique photos allowed stored table different attribute values 
linkage table connection collections table photos table 
stores links collections photos 
people table stores information people appear photo library 
initial implementation attributes include name family name person unique people name allowed stored people table 
eventually people table extended include personal information mail address exporting photo library homepage address occupation 
appearance table stores information person photo 
serves linkage photos table people table 
attributes include relative coordinates upper left corner lower right people photos 
designing photo library major assumptions concerning library collections photos 
assumptions classified follows relationship collections photos relationship collections table linkage table set collection contain multiple photos relationship photos table linkage table set photo included multiple collections 
possible collection contains photo multiple times permit slide presentation 
different collections exactly set photos 
photos different path names different photos copies photo 
relationship photos people relationship photos table appearance table set photo contain multiple persons relationship people table appearance table set person included multiple photos 
multiple appearances person photo allowed 
composite pair name family name unique people table 
relationship library collections photos library photo contained multiple collections multiple times attributes annotations 
design photo library database considered annotation names people photos photo library database easily extended adding object table animal table keyword table connection tables similar appearance table 
photo library database design flexible annotation possible
