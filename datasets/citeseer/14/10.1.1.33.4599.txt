terminology identification component pasta systems consists pipeline architecture processing stages described detail section 
text preprocessing provides information structure text individual units terms tokens words subword units 

morphological analysis identifies root form suffix token 

term lookup involves lookup possibly multi word terms specialised terminology lexicons 

terminology parsing applies specialised grammar rules identification final classification multi token terms 

term matching applies hand constructed matching rules identify non classified terms variant forms terms previously classified text

text preprocessing text preprocessing stage consists text structure analysis module tokenisation module 
scientific articles typically standard structure including names authors number different sections

sgml modules may specify certain text regions excluded subsequent processing may applications portions text interest speed important concern 
tokenisation module divide input text basic types tokens 
lowest level tokenisation input needs allow tokens delimited whitespace 
example strings expressing residue terms may need split matched separately lexical lookup stage 
module provides information basic kinds tokens ffl tokens lowercase ffl tokens uppercase nf ffl tokens uppercase lowercase characters ffl numeric type ffl symbols non alphanumeric symbols ffl white space newline characters morphological analysis morphological analysis stage identify root forms words suffixes information cues lexical matches subsequent stages 
surface cues allow identification named entities person organisation names newswire texts available terms biochemical domain

lexical lookup stage system generalised allow case insens itive matching consequence morphological information token significant 
general english morphological analyser supplemented identify common biochemical suffixes ase yl cues terminology identification 
term lookup terminology lexicons assembled publicly available resources swiss prot scop annotated training corpora looking biochemical terms text

term lexicons term classes identified final system output lexicons permit terms term components finely stage ultimately required

lexicons derived existing biochemical resources 
cases term lexicons derived single resource correspond syntactic components take part composition multiword terms 
example information databases enzyme names new lexicons produced containing terms manually identified belonging syntactic term subclasses enzyme head enzyme prefix enzyme modifier 
note lexicon lookup process sufficient definitive term recognition classification 
particular term may lexicon term may occur lexicons occurs protein species lexicons 
addition term occurs lexicon may occur part longer term occurring lexicon example amino acid part protein name 
lexicon lookup efficient multi word terms increased probability different spelling variations different ordering term constituent parts text 
instance protein transcription factor transcription factor nf kappa transcription factor text 
reasons rule term parser essential supplement lexicon lookup approach term recognition classification 
terminology parsing application rule terminology parser requires terms decomposed constituent parts 
constituents categorised separately term lookup phase specific properties identified tokenisation morphological analysis stages 
assist process terminology lexicons structured distinguish various term components complete terms assembled grammar rules
