representation formalism ontologies basic support want provide answering queries instances ontology 
ontology may described taxonomies rules 
effective efficient query evaluation procedures horn logic languages inference engine horn logic 
simple horn logic appropriate epistemological point view reasons 
epistemological primitives simple predicate logic rich support adequate representations ontologies 

artificial express logical relationships horn clauses 
subsequently discuss overcame shortcomings 

elementary expressions usually ontologies defined concepts classes relationships attributes relationships axioms 
adequate language defining ontology provide modeling primitives notions 
frame logic kifer provides modeling primitives integrates logical framework providing horn logic subset 
furthermore contrast description logic expressing ontology frame logic allows queries directly parts ontology class citizens 
instances values concept attribute names provided answers variable substitutions 
rdf tex slightly modified variant frame logic suits needs 
principally elementary modeling primitives gamma subclassing meaning class subclass 
gamma instance meaning instance class gamma attribute declaration 
meaning instances class attribute defined value instance 
gamma attribute value meaning instance attribute value gamma part meaning part 
gamma relations predicate expressions usual logic representation formalisms terms arguments object expressions 

complex expressions elementary expressions complex ones built

concept hierarchy consists elementary expressions declaring subclass relationships 
attribute definitions declare attributes concepts valid types values attributes 
rule ensures symmetry cooperation second rule specifies person known publication publication author particular person vice versa 
kind rule completes knowledge base information distributed incomplete reduces development maintenance effort 
especially double rules useful explicate connection object attribute value triples

providing input ontobroker able answer queries ontobroker needs facts stored knowledge base 
knowledge base contains knowledge collected scattered web sources 
ashish knoblock distinguish classes web sources gamma multiple instance sources share structure provide different information cia world fact book cia provides information different countries stored similarly structured pages page country gamma single instance sources provide large amounts data structured format 
rdf tex gamma loosely structured pages generalizable structure personal home pages 
sources contain knowledge accessible ontobroker 
allow integration knowledge knowledge base formalized 
done ways sources falling categories allow implement wrappers wiederhold genesereth automatically extract factual knowledge sources 
structure pages known stable time wrappers automatically create parts knowledge base ontobroker allow inferencing query answering provided information 
applied approach cia world fact book simple ontology countries characteristics 
second way provide formal representation unstructured information manual 
formalization third case mentioned hardly achieved automatically chose manual annotation approach capture loosely structured information 
large amounts information provided www formulated hyper text mark language html hardly structured pages 
developed minor extension html syntax attribute enable ontological annotation web pages 
annotating resources semantic information certain advantages simple meta tagging resources gamma embedded annotations located physically close rendered information belong 
gamma semantic information part represented informal text resource text reused formal way value attributes 
gamma way hyper links contained web pages reused establish formal relations concepts 
general idea approach see fensel details take html page starting point add ontologically relevant tags mark 
minor changes information contained page annotated accessible facts ontobroker 
approach allows providers annotate web pages gradually completely formalize knowledge contained 
pages remain readable standard browsers 
need keep different sources date consistent reduces development maintenance effort considerably

example annotated web page 
provide different epistemological primitives annotate ontological information web documents 
object identified url uniform resource locator defined instance certain class 

value object attribute set 

relationship objects may established 
primitives expressed extended version frequent html tag anchor tag 
typically provider information defines object 
done stating class ontology instance 
example richard benjamins home page part sources depicted define researcher say url home page instance class researcher 
express html extension uses line home page 
www iiia csic es richard researcher 
identifier www iiia csic es richard denotes object instance class researcher 
id url richard benjamins home page researcher denoted url home page see 
rdf tex class associated set attributes 
instance class define values attributes 
define attribute value web page knowledge provider list object attribute value 
example ontology contains attribute email object class researcher 
richard benjamins wants provide email address uses line home page 
www iiia csic es richard email mailto richard iiia csic es 
line states object denoted handle value mailto richard iiia csic es attribute email 
objects attributes defined single web page objects related explicitly 
name relation rel object handles obj definition looks rel obj obj obj listed examples look clumsy esp long object handles redundancy due writing information twice browser second time ontobroker 
annotation language provides means ease annotating web pages get rid big share redundancy fensel 
set keywords special meanings allowed part annotation syntax 
keyword page represents web page ontological mark contained 
useful looking page representative object 
example home page researcher represent person knowledge base 
defined kind annotation page researcher 
annotation defines affiliation attribute object denoted url current page takes value anchor tag href attribute 
page affiliation href href www iiia csic es 
href keyword allows establish relations objects lot typing hyper links reused ontological mark 
hyper links directly integrated semantic information text rendered browser part formal knowledge rdf tex table ii 
principle mechanism translating logic predicate logic frame logic meaning predicate logic class subclass sub instance class isa instances attribute defined value instance att type instance attribute value att val part part page firstname body 
richard defines richard contained 
attribute value firstname 
keyword body allows kind reuse 
conventions annotation web pages concise redundancy nearly avoided 
tight coupling eases metadata maintenance frequently changing resources changing rendered data automatically reflected semantic mark 
technique just currently tailored html easily adapted xml mark language changes required slight modifications respective document type definition dtd language 
especially important applications xml languages currently developed
