evaluation search systems trec framework offers advantages 
reproducible results 

blind testing 
document judges know documents retrieved systems aware hypotheses tested 
participating researchers find documents relevant tell system performing runs submitted 

sharing relevance judgments large number groups significantly reduces total cost evaluations dramatically magnifies benefit compared similar human judged evaluation experiments conducted individual groups 

collaborative experiments 
interesting result obtained single experiment may due errors implementing algorithm deficiencies controlling extraneous variables

note planned link information available full gigabyte collection relates gigabyte subset shown 
ensure higher degree useful connectivity obtained isolated gigabyte collection

effectiveness comparison trec systems commercial search engines reported interesting systems indexed set pages vlc runs title queries 
tempting conclude commercial search engine ranking algorithms state art possible source problem may lie spidering ranking 
consequently reported experiment serves illustrate potential value effectiveness comparisons blind judgments independent relevance judges averaged large number standardised topics
