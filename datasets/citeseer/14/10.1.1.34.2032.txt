physical envelope simple application cryptography packet switched network hides messages sent reveal talking 
onion routing general purpose infrastructure private communication public network 
provides anonymous connections strongly resistant eavesdropping traffic analysis 
connections bidirectional near real time connection connectionless traffic

onion routing operates dynamically building anonymous connections network real time chaum mixes 
mix store forward device accepts number fixed length messages numerous sources performs cryptographic transformations messages forwards messages destination random order 
single mix tracking particular message specific bit pattern size ordering respect messages difficult

information distributed securely network automatically new nodes come line information changes 
moving data network onion routing anonymous connections protocol independent exist phases connection setup data movement connection tear 
setup begins initiator creates onion defines path connection network 
onion recursively layered data structure specifies properties connection point route cryptographic control information different symmetric cryptographic algorithms keys data movement phase 
onion router route uses public key decrypt entire onion receives 
operation exposes cryptographic control information identity onion router embedded onion 
onion router pads embedded onion maintain fixed size sends onion router 
connection established data sent directions 
data initiator repeatedly pre encrypted algorithms keys specified onion 
data moves anonymous connection onion router removes layer encryption defined cryptographic control information onion defining route data arrives plaintext recipient 
layering occurs reverse order different algorithms keys data moving backward

information onions data network control sent onion routing network uniform sized cells 
cells arriving fixed time interval mixed reduce correlation network insiders 
likewise long standing connections onion routers padded bandwidth limited foil external observers 
onion looks different onion router connection layered publickey cryptography 
similarly layering symmetric cryptography data phase cells appear different onion router 
design resists traffic analysis effectively deployed mechanisms internet communication 
overhead onion routing overhead relatively small 
connection setup overhead typically second appears noticeable delays associated normal web connection setup internet 
computationally expensive public key cryptography connection setup phase 
public key decryption expensive encryption public key burden mainly placed onion routers dedicated hardware acceleration justified 
data movement phase uses secret key symmetric cryptography faster 
furthermore symmetric encryption pipelined data throughput fast ordinary link encryption 
data latency affected number onion routers connection vary route length duration mix cycles 
network architectures shift trust proxies onion routers components run variety distributed configurations 
allows onion routing mesh wide variety operational policy environments 
extreme proxies run remotely 
user secure connection firewall trusted remote proxy onion routing protection utilized installing software inducing local computational overhead 
extreme trusted components run locally providing maximum protection anonymity privacy non local components participating connection 
extremes multiple configurations proxies onion routers running enclave firewalls isps 
shifting trust way onion routing complement services anonymizer 
anonymizer uses central trusted intermediary provide sender anonymity hide identity sender receiver 
onion routing privacy anonymizer run filtering proxy user desktop enclave firewall user isp add sender anonymity 
security improved filtering executes machine user trusts communication leaving machine resist traffic analysis 
security depth removes central point failure network traffic anonymity 
provides various services described issue 
onion routing designed handle email addition 
onion routing configured trusted functions performed various locations 
communication points anonymous resistant traffic analysis 
onion routing especially natural complements 
extensions natural extension onion routing reply onions 
reply onions allow connections back anonymous sender onion routing network long original connection existed 
reply onions send anonymous replies response previously received anonymous email 
enable novel applications anonymous publishing anonymous urls similar rewebber project 
summary onion routing traffic analysis resistant infrastructure easily accessible low overhead protect wide variety applications flexible adapt various network environments security needs
