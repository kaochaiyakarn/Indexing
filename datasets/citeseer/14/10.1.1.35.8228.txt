feature selection similarity measures 
wellknown clustering techniques numerical features certain approaches assume categorical data 
general non binary features informative capture noisy behavior better small number samples 
example market basket data analysis feature typically represents absence presence particular product current basket 
treats buyer single corn box buys boxes 
opossum extend common boolean notation non negative real valued features 
feature represents volume product basket sample volume measured product quantity prefer monetary value product price quantity quantify feature volume 
yields continuous distribution feature values large data sets 
importantly monetary value represents normalization feature dimensions 
normalization highly desirable better aligns relevance clustering retail management objectives 
strehl ghosh key idea dealing high dimensional data similarity space original vector space feature vectors reside 
similarity measures captures related data points 
symmetric self similarity 
brute force implementation involve operations similarity needs computed pair data points involve dimensions 
similarity computed storage required similarity matrix 
matrix computed clustering routine depend 
obvious way compute similarity suitable monotonic inverse function minkowski distance candidates include kx 
similarity de ned angle cosine angle vectors

retail data assumption loses important information life time customer value normalizing
