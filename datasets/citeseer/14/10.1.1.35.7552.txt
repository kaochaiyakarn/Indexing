approach aim learn subcategorization frames verbs ontology specific domain texts 
existing knowledge bases eurowordnet wordnet frequently general applications specific domains 
ontologies complete suitable processing texts technical languages 
hand purpose directed ontologies may store meanings syntactic roles word increasing risk semantic ambiguity 
specific domain vocabulary possible usage reduced ontologies semantic structure domain applicable 
www lri fr recherche ia asium html wordnet overly general 
hand wordnet may lack specific terminology application domain 
contrary approach increasing specializing general ontologies specific domain basili learn ontology verbs frames corpus reducing risk inconsistency 
previous attempts automatically revise subcategorization frames subset ontology acquired domain expert failed 
revision acquired knowledge respect training texts required deep restructuring knowledge incremental cooperative ml revision methods able handle 
main reason expert built ontology subcategorization frames priori reflected texts 
experiment illustrates limitation manual acquisition domain experts linguists 
learned knowledge asium learns subcategorization frames drop object explosive public place verb drop 
couples object explosive public place subcategories object syntactic role preposition place concepts restrictions selection 
usually asium learns verb frames verb prep syntactic role concept frames general ones defined lfg formalism subcategories verb arguments subject direct object indirect object adjuncts 
framework restrictions selection filled exhaustive list nouns canonical form concepts defined ontology 
ontology represents generality relations concepts form directed acyclic graph dag 
example ontology train vehicle vehicle vehicle 
method learns ontology subcategorization frames unsupervised manner texts natural language 
concepts formed labeled expert 
knowledge acquisition method step acquisition process automatically extract syntactic frames texts 
syntactic parser developed constant 
case syntactic ambiguities gives interpretations asium uses theses interpretations 
experiments shown ml method works theses ambiguities acquisition semantic knowledge affected 
method avoids time consuming manual disambiguation step 
frames subcategorization frames concepts replaced nouns 
verb prep 
role head noun asium uses head nouns complements links verbs 
adjectives empty nouns 
experiments shown informations learn semantic knowledge noisy syntactic parsing 
learning method relies observation syntactic regularities context words 
assume head nouns occuring preposition syntactic role represent called basic class semantic similarity line grefenstette peat lexical functional grammar 
asium called unsupervised concepts examples provided input 
method double regularity model asium gathers nouns representing concept share different verb preposition syntactic role contexts grishman 
experiments show forms reliable concepts requiring involvement user 
similarity measure computes overlap lists nouns details 
usual conceptual clustering validity learned concepts relies quality similarity measure clusters increases size intersection 
basic classes successively aggregated bottom breadth conceptual clustering method form concepts ontology level level expert validation labelling level 
cluster new construction validated 
complexity reasons number clusters aggregated restricted affect relevance learned concept 
verb subcategorization frames learned parallel new concept fills corresponding restriction selection resulting generalization initial syntactic frames allows cover examples occur texts 
clustering process identify lists nouns occuring preposition function augments list induction 
aggregation basic classes different couples verb prep function create new concept allowed

subcategorization frames travel subject human drive subject human object experts control link new concept verb threshold fixed expert measure generalization risk 
validation process relatively quick due ergonomic user interface 
asium provides expert list newly covered examples order estimate generality proposed concept

sim lists nouns sim lists common nouns 
related semantic knowledge acquisition hindle method gather nouns regarding syntactic regularities arguments adjuncts verbs

grefenstette proposes learn close basic classes 
double similarity model learns concept gathering basic classes similarity 
model limits number non relevant produced concepts

buchholz learns subcategorization frames close supervised method time consuming expert 
way thompson chill zelle learns case roles thesaurus texts syntactically parsed chill fully semantically annotated hand 
case roles differs subcategorization frames prepositions grammatical functions replaced semantic roles agent patient 
contrary ontology learned asium selectional restrictions learned attribute value lists 
unsupervised learning approach asium delays concepts labelling learning process considerably reduces time needed expert 
asium learning semantic roles labelled assuming couple verb prep function represents specific semantic role 
riloff learns concepts texts 
uses lists nouns representing general concepts seeds uses method augment lists concepts 
augmented lists checked expert retains nouns representing concept 
assume basic classes asium seeds increased induction process 
main advantage number concepts limited learn parallel subcategorization frames verbs time consuming validation needed
