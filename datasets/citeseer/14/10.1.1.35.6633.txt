recognizing class instances task system identify new instances ontology classes text sources web 
section address case class instances represented web pages example instance student class represented student home page 
part section discuss statistical approach classifying web pages words pages 
second part section discuss learning order rules classify web pages 
consider information urls improve page classification accuracy 
statistical text classification statistical page classification method involves building probabilistic model class labeled training data classifying newly seen pages selecting class probable evidence words describing new page 
common learning text classifiers probabilistic models ignore sequence words occur 
models called unigram bag words models statistics single words isolation 
approach classifying web pages naive bayes method minor modifications kullback leibler divergence 
precisely classify document belonging class rule argmax log pr pr jd log pr jc pr jd number words size vocabulary ith word vocabulary 
jc represents probability drawing document class jd represents frequency occurrence document method exactly classifications naive bayes produces classification scores extreme better reflect uncertainty produced naive bayes 
estimating word probabilities pr jc smoothing method prevents words having zero probability provides robust estimates infrequently occurring words 
get accurate classifications restricted vocabulary size limit vocabulary words experiments 
vocabulary selected ranking words average mutual information respect class labels 
evaluate method fold crossvalidation methodology 
conduct runs train classifiers data universities data set plus auxiliary set pages mentioned previous section test classifiers university held 
iteration hold different university test set 
classification calculate associated measure confidence simply classification score described formula 
setting minimum threshold confidence select point sacrifices coverage order obtain increased accuracy 
goal automatically extracting knowledge base information web desirable high accuracy classifier need limit coverage pages available web 
effect trading coverage accuracy shown 
horizontal axis plot represents coverage percentage pages class correctly classified belonging class 
vertical axis represents accuracy accuracy coverage course student faculty research project department staff accuracy coverage statistical classifiers 
percentage pages classified class members class 
understand results consider example class student 
accepted classifiers decisions time predicted student correct time 
raise confidence threshold class accuracy predictions rises 
example coverage accuracy reaches level 
nearly misclassifications statistical text classifiers involve types mistakes 
classifiers confuse different subclasses person 
example staff instances correctly assigned staff category correctly classified general class person 
result suggests mistakes equally harmful fail correctly classify instance leaf classes ontology correct inferences correctly assign general class 
second common form mistake involves classifying pages core classes instances correctly classified 
low level classification accuracy class largely explained nature class 
instances class content word statistics similar instances core classes 
example home page course belong course class secondary pages course page describing reading assignments belong class 
content pages class suggest properly belong core classes motivation including classes 
system browsing web adding new instances knowledge base want ensure add multiple instances correspond realworld object 
example add new instances knowledge base encounter course home page secondary page listing reading assignments
