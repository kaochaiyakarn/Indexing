heterogeneous information resources need semantic access support information knowledge exchange key issue information society 
exponential growth online information intranets web leads information overload 
cut time wasted searching browsing reduce associated user frustration selective user access needed 
possible automatic meaning directed semantic information processing online documents

world wide web www drastically boosted availability electronic information 
generation web changed daily practice changes significant near 
web change reach level user service 
currently web incredibly large static information source 
main burden information access extraction interpretation rests human user 
document management systems market severe weaknesses searching information existing keyword search retrieves irrelevant information uses certain term different meaning misses information different terms meaning desired content 
extracting information currently human browsing reading required extract relevant information information sources automatic agents possess commonsense knowledge required extract information textual representations fail integrate information spread different sources 
maintaining weakly structured text sources difficult time consuming activity sources large 
keeping collections consistent correct upto date requires mechanized representations semantics help detect anomalies 
automatic document generation enable adaptive websites dynamically reconfigured user profiles aspects relevance 
generation semi structured information presentations semi structured data requires machine accessible representation semantics information sources 
tim berners lee coined vision semantic web provides automated services machine processable semantics data heuristics metadata 
explicit representation semantics data accompanied domain theories ontologies enable knowledge web provides qualitatively new level service 
weaves net linking incredibly large parts human knowledge complements machine 
various automated services support human user achieving goals accessing providing information machine understandable form

increasingly companies realize intranets valuable repositories corporate knowledge 
rapidly increasing volumes information turning useful knowledge major problem 
knowledge management leveraging corporate knowledge greater productivity value competitiveness
