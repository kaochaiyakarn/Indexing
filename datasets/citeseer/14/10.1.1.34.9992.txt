context toolkit easy add context implicit input existing applications don context 
context toolkit consists basic building blocks context widgets context aggregators context interpreters 
shows relationship sample context components applications 
context toolkit components arrows indicate data flow 
context widgets encapsulate information single piece context location activity example 
provide uniform interface components applications context hiding details underlying context sensing mechanism allowing treat implicit explicit input manner 
context widgets allow heterogeneous sensors sense redundant input regardless input implicit explicit 
widgets maintain persistent record context sense 
allow components poll subscribe context information maintain 
widgets responsible collecting information environment 
context interpreter interpret context 
example context widget may provide location context form latitude longitude application may require location form street name 
context interpreter may provide abstraction 
complex interpreter may take context widgets conference room infer meeting place 
context aggregator similar widget supports set features widget

oops oops gui graphical user interface toolkit provides support building interfaces recognizers 
sensing recognition ambiguous oops provides support tracking resolving mediating uncertainty 
oops provides support building interfaces focus oops integrating recognition exist ing input dispatching system gui toolkit oops built 
means example recognizer produces text events dispatched mechanism characters produced keyboard available consumes keyboard input 
additionally oops provides internal model recognized input concept hierarchical events allows separation mediation recognition application 
see key abstraction extended context toolkit 
model uses directed graph keep track source events interpretations produced recognizers 
example user speaks speech recognizer may take audio source event produce sentences interpretations 
sentences may interpreted example natural language system nouns verbs shows resulting graph 
graph representing interpretations 
note different sentences shown graph correct user said 
call situation ambiguous mediation resolve ambiguity 
particular mediator display feedback interpretations user select repeat input 
correct input known oops updates directed graph include information events accepted rejected notifies recognizer produced events consumers events happened 
point consumers act event example executing command specified user speech 
summarize oops automatically identifies ambiguity input intervenes recognizer application passing directed graph mediator 
ambiguity resolved oops allows processing input continue normal 
mediating imperfect context stated previously context toolkit consists widgets implicitly sense context aggregators collect related context interpreters convert context types applications context communications infrastructure delivers context distributed components 
oops consists applications interfaces produce input recognizers convert input types applications input

order understand extensions consider single interaction 
initially context implicitly sensed context widget 
context sent interpreter equivalent recognizer oops 
context interpreter creates multiple ambiguous interpretations context 
interpretation event contains set attribute name value pairs piece context information interpretation source produced 
result directed graph just representation oops 
widget receives interpretations sends subscribers 
note widget send entire graph subscribers just events match subscription request 
done order minimize network calls quite extensive costly graph generated mediated 
widgets aggregators applications may subscribe widget components include support dealing ambiguous events mediation events 
subscriber context toolkit receives data input handler responsible dealing distributed communications 
input handler checks incoming context ambiguity necessary sends context mediator subscribing component 
mediators intervene widgets aggregators applications way intervene recognizers applications oops 
subscriber may aggregator widget need distributed feedback services separate applications 
example mediator may widget generated ambiguous event communicate user sensors usually located things sensing 
mediator provides feedback user user responds additional input 
mediator uses information update event graph 
telling widget produced events accept reject correct incorrect 
widget propagates changes subscribers 
ambiguity resolved events delivered normal subscribers act 
mediation process continues

high level abstractions similar practice extended context toolkit deal new issues relevant design oops 
context toolkit distributed system mediation interactive process requires appropriate response times portions event graph subscribed passed network

providing widget aggregator application access entire graph piece context having update change occurred new event added event accepted rejected impedes system ability deliver context timely fashion required provide feedback action context 
second input may produced different physical locations architecture supports distributed feedback 
allows mediation occur user location input sensed
