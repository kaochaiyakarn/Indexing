protection rights digital assets protection way discourage unintended digital content copying unauthorized resale show sufficient prevent piracy scene especially price legal content high 
various approaches protecting intended usage digital content exist 
distinguish protection encryption protection watermarking protection law 
protection encryption 
encryption systems offer facilities prevent violations intended usage music number weak spots 
consumer copies resampling analog output 
small quality loss subsequent copies loss 
second consumer intercept decrypted bitstream save stream file 
third encrypted content attacked 
protection watermarking 
step watermark content 
watermark court prove violations intended usage content 
watermarking technology possible identify digital content identify original producer content identify consumer sold rights digital content 
information important violations intended usage content 
number attacks watermarks identified protection watermarking way go 
protection law 
line defense person violates intended usage digital content 
protection digital content law number weaknesses 
law differs countries 
laws countries offer handles illegal content 
second country owner content difficult 
furthermore scale 
large number small exists case music copying downloading feasible sue individually 
digital content sold bear mind consumer violate intended usage content easily 
remains true various protection schemes applied 
especially motivation consumer high able obtain digital content sources legal ones 
protection digital content sufficient address problem misuse digital content 
business oriented approaches versioning bundling 
various authors instance proposed business oriented solutions ensure content creators get paid creative efforts 
solutions limited effective highly interactive time dependent digital content content value quickly decreases time 
way exploit time dependence digital content create multiple versions example number music track different quality levels images 
number versions consumer choose usually limited illegal copies versioned content easily accessible 
extreme position sell complementary related products easily copied merchandise artists content nearly free 
scenario digital content plays role attracting consumers site revenues come related sales 
variation theme bundling consumer buy merchandise buys associated digital content 
general limitation business oriented approaches exploiting time dependent value digital content cases digital products classic songs movies maintain value long periods time 
important analyze concept consumer value contained digital content solely consider generation revenues complementary products related sales

positioning business models il legal content versus created consumer value 
shows various business model options may positioned design space spanned degree legality degree consumer value created 
quadrant digital content legal offered low consumer value interesting business point view 
illegal content low consumer value second quadrant popular consumers 
example convenience low consumers attracted obtain illegal content 
offerings quadrant left note business point view technical legal protection measures really needed 
third quadrant illegal content high consumer value highly unwanted 
indicated ways business models positioned quadrant attractive 
illegal content high consumer value requires high visibility accessibility market 
takes effort consumers find select product 
furthermore easy convenient obtain consume content 
visibility high quality fulfillment infrastructure enable content owners take corrective action example suppliers illegal content ask legally operating internet service providers remove block illegal content 
measures remove illegal offerings entirely result illegal content lower consumer value moving illegal offerings undesirable quadrant uninteresting quadrant words measures generate utility destruction 
alternatively suppliers illegal content may decide set legal operation move quadrant 
quadrant represents desired situation providing legal content high consumer value 
shows legal content providers quadrant may strive increase consumer value created digital products offer 
generally approach increase value gap legal illegal offerings 
consumer value receipts sacrifices analyze factors play role various types consumer value creation quantified control parameters speak design optimally positioned business model 
marketing literature consumer value stated terms value equation consumer value sacri ice sacrifices comprise costs consumer consume product receipts represent sum total benefits experiences consuming product 
consumer buy product consumer value ratio greater consumer decides buy product sacrifices outweigh receipts 
receipts sacrifices need decomposed 
distinguish costs 
sacrifices result direct transfer money consumer supplier 
second value types terms holbrook framework directly contribute sacrifices receipts 
example inconvenience consumer download time music long 
focus analysis concentrate specific service selling bits product comprising right listen track music 
product allows consumer select track music selection music played soon possible 
assume non streaming service track downloaded completely consumer listen 
illustrate claim value creation key consideration enhance legal ways selling bits investigating quantifying possible business scenarios terms consumer value prototypical consumer segments viz money lack time students scarce money resources time 
scenario studied perspectives obtaining music legally obtaining music illegally 
pocket costs consumer wants listen track pay money directly called pocket costs
