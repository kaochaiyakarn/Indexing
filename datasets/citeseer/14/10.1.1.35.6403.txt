sensical developing intelligent calendar application called sensical provides improvements traditional calendar programs 
reduces entry time filling certain information automatically 
second produces warning messages help user avoid obvious 
sensical runs extension ical ghemawat batch process data exported calendar programs

filling missing information second step sensical helps user filling missing information providing intelligent defaults 
sensical fills length appointment automatically 
example user enters new calendar item dinner time duration automatically set hours typical length dinner 
done querying thoughttreasure typical duration activity 
mueller presents sample java code querying thoughttreasure duration 

pointing problems third step sensical points potential problems violations common sense user 
example user enters breakfast city diner time am application responds eating breakfast am

pieces common sense contained thoughttreasure 
hardcoded sensical 
thoughttreasure uses multiple representation schemes common sense grids assertions procedures 
thoughttreasure grids provide information objects typically 
currently grids defined 
abbreviated version grid represents hotel room park plaza bed mw door wx zw wall phone night table wd hotel room key right specifies objects associated characters represents wall represents 
contiguous characters grid represent single objects 
bed occupies cells containing 
hotel room defined filling region grid wd specifies fill cells reachable character going wall door 
mueller presents sample java code thoughttreasure grids determine typical locations objects 
thoughttreasure assertions represent facts inference rules typical time day duration location activity taxonomy foods preferences 
thoughttreasure procedures simulating behavior people attempting achieve goal simulating behavior objects devices determining travel time 
sensical uses thoughttreasure resource examining calendar items potential problems 
checking restaurant serves food satisfies preferences participant sensical queries thoughttreasure restaurant serves foods preferences avoids 
information preferences person stored sensical profile
