ad hoc track focus research carried adhoc track query processing query expansion weighting core concept identification 
expected produce incremental improvements compared techniques previous years core concept research continues new direction bayesian net model 
official results ad hoc track significantly lower failure index volume test data 
ad hoc approach query processing area emphasis produce simpler effective process replace complex mixture linguistic statistical techniques developed trec previous years 
steps new process removing structure identifying phrases proper nouns recognizing presence foreign country requirements 
structure refers language constructs queries fillers occasional negative effects retrieval 
examples structure give documents 
pros cons 
relevant document contain 
am interested 
structure removal uses table structures part query processing minor modification previous year process 
phrase identification year primarily phrase dictionary part speech tagging previously 
construct table lexical acquisition program created process large amounts text select suitable phrase candidates 
part speech statistical approaches identifying phrases evaluations shows statistical approach faster accurate 
statistical approach similar statistical phrases salton records phrase candidates refines removes low frequencies 
phrase candidates sequences non words words include usual small list words retrieval systems plus irregular verbs numbers exceptions dates title words designators locations 
long sequences words split rules look certain endings case changes conjunctions 
final refinement checks see subsequences replace longer sequences 
phrase table query processing time identify possible phrases query

query expansion year investigated refinements local context analysis lca approach trec year described sigir particular different parameters number text passages expansion number concepts added query 
trec fewer passages top expansion produced better results 
observed combination database queries

significant change lca approach year base expansion passages retrieved larger database just volumes trec volumes federal register data omitted 
reason simple increasing size database increases likelihood topical material retrieved increases likelihood finding expansion concepts 
ways approach negatively affect results 
documents content little interest containing number query terms introduced larger database 
federal register documents example documents
