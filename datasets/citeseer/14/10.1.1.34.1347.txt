centrally located contested terrain philosophy cognitive science questions general form human cognitive architecture 
mainstream holds human mind digital computer haugeland task cognitive science simply details functional architecture pylyshyn 
broad empirical hypothesis supported range powerful considerations ranging general philosophical arguments explanatory virtues particular cognitive models 
called classical approach faces range serious difficulties 
interestingly problems failed persuade classical cognitive scientists abandon traditional computational approach 
factors invoked explain conservatism important widely held belief simply remotely plausible alternative classical approach 
right problems facing classical approach regarded fatal objections fascinating scientific challenges 
unfortunately belief serious alternative classical approach easily self fulfilling 
scientists putting effort developing alternatives helps bring state affairs purports describe 
healthy scientific environment certain amount effort pursuit alternative explanatory frameworks 
pursuit alternatives necessary dominant approach standing genuinely empirical hypothesis merits properly established fair comparison 
cognitive science sense healthy science 
researchers scattered length breadth discipline actively engaged developing non classical accounts various aspects cognition 
important question philosophy cognitive science diverse efforts existing emerging conceptions cognitive architecture sufficient generality plausibility stand genuine alternative orthodox computational approach 
main ambition provide perspective landscape cognitive science discern outlines emerging alternatives classical conception human cognitive architecture

representation way avoid symbolic representation dispense representation altogether 
village supposed believed stimuli connected directly responses proprietary circuits known mysterious meaning bearing inner states entered picture

years anti representational tendencies 
attempts build simple situated agents led designs incorporate inner representations beer brooks 
attempts understand motor control perceptual processes led theories inner representations traditional kind kelso freeman thelen smith 
inspired new round speculation major portion human cognitive processes representation free 
claim cognition may turn supra representational simple need representation subtle complex representations traditional form just get way 
speculation inherits measure philosophical depth profound reflections likes heidegger dreyfus 
positive result anti representational wider appreciation fact postulate representations cognitive system empirical hypothesis turn false 
wary automatically assuming aspect cognition representational underpinning beer 
noted aspects higher central cognition plausible accounts currently imagined incorporate inner representations kind 
anti amount serious alternative classical computational conception cognitive architecture starting sketching interesting accounts activities sentence comprehension grocery shopping explained help inner entities encoding standing aspects domain question 
holding breath advised 
way avoid classical commitment symbolic representation base cognitive architecture representations fundamentally different kind 

candidates promising 
casting issues way leads directly fact long standing philosophical project general taxonomy kinds representation 
ideally possess exhaustive catalogue possible ways representing information 
inquire way constitutes interesting alternative candidate medium human cognitive functioning 
taxonomies developed philosophers standardly admit highest level generic kinds symbolic propositional sentential logical pictorial analog iconic 
usually agreed representation best highly limited utility cognitive functioning 
led people assume really interesting alternative classical symbolic representations 
premature 
simply assumes traditional philosophical distinction symbolic exhaustive classification 
examining standard treatments issue uncovers precious little argument idea 
philosophers concerned understand interesting differences sentences pictures argue representations sentential pictorial 
leaves open possibility genera representations lying outside philosophers range consideration 
talk distributed representation increasingly common cognitive science particularly connectionist circles 
observation suggests obvious question distributed representation third genus able form basis alternative conception cognitive architecture 
possibility surely worth looking 
essential step determining distributed representation forms third genus representation clarifying meaning term distributed 
trickier 
language cognitive science breed ancestors include common stock ordinary language technical discourses 
concept distribution inherits strands sense casual talk domains disparate neuroscience mathematical psychology neural networks optics 
sensibly address issue distribution sense interesting alternative symbolic representation 
suppose want able represent various items domain quantity resources available representing 
suppose resources naturally divisible minimal portions chunks called units examples units include single index cards bits words digital computer neurons connectionist processing units weighted interconnections forth 
obvious way proceed assign unit item 
item represented just case unit configured appropriate way 
schemes purely local 
note localist schemes item represented depends state proprietary unit states units irrelevant 
distributed scheme basic sense representing item involves suitably configuring number units 
representation spread minimal quantity available resources 
connectionist network example item represented particular pattern activation pool neural units state neural unit pool relevant determining item represented time hinton mcclelland rumelhart 
sparse distributed schemes relatively small proportion relevant pool units active item represented kanerva 
limiting case sparse distributed representation pattern involving activity just unit activity units 
strictly speaking representations distributed involve specifying state units 
keep everybody confused representations described local thorpe 
ideas illustrated familiar rumelhart mcclelland connectionist model past tense learning 
primary items verb base forms past tense forms 
represented sparse distributed activity patterns pools neural units 
neural units represent features verbs strictly local fashion 
term distributed reserved situations multiple items represented simultaneously exactly set units murdock 
schemes representations distributed basic sense spread impossible partition units disjoint sets responsible encoding distinct items 
example paul smolensky described scheme representing complex structures pairs basic role filler patterns combined tensor product operation resulting patterns added 
resulting representation basic constituents represented structure encoded simultaneously set units 
elaborate form distribution 
primary item represented set units part item represented superposed fashion units subset units manages represent primary item 
standard example optical 
pure cases remarkable property entire visual scene recovered portion 
holographic principles deployed number representation schemes cognitive science metcalfe plate 
various notions distribution apparent brief survey obviously futile ask distributed representations general interesting alternative symbolic representation 
attention focused particular defined notion 
turns concept holding theoretical utility philosophy cognitive science semantic superposition roughly multiple items represented simultaneously exactly extent available resources 
situation point chunk resources say representation item different chunk say representation item 
fortunately intuitive idea reasonably rigorous characterization 
key move take mathematical notion distributing transformation 
operation takes function transforms function way value point depends value point fourier transformation st gt se dt classic example 
value point obtained integrating product function shape depends value dependent entire function turns standard cases distributed representation cognitive science fit neatly distributing transformation framework 
cases regard function mathematical specification various items represented regard specification representation particular distributing transformation see 
distributing transformation item item representation item specifies specifies represents 
generic structure distributed representation 
note domain represented item specified restriction fi sub domain si detailed explanation see van gelder 
consider example archetypal case hidden unit activation patterns layer fully connected feedforward connectionist networks 
assume current purposes hidden unit pattern represents activation pattern input layer 
intuitively superposed representation information state input unit hidden layer 
precisely variable acts index input units function specifies activation values units similarly hidden units 
mathematical relation operation gt wts just standard activation update function rumelhart hinton williams dressed way reveal fact distributing transformation 
paves way reasonably precise definition distributed representation suitable discussing issues basic form human cognitive architecture 
basic idea particular distributing transformations yield particular schemes distributed representation 
think distributing transformation black box plug functions describing groups items represented receive functions describing distributed representations groups items 
representation counts distributed just case belongs scheme representations governed distributing transformation 
distributed representation defined way really distinct genus 
categories symbolic distributed representation disjoint 
way address question ask conditions representation satisfy belong kind symbolic directly conflict conditions satisfy belong distributed 
answer kinds defined ways reasonably precise useful theoretical purposes turns fact conflicts kinds van gelder 
basically symbolic representation impose characteristic locality requirements parts represented content correspond parts representation distinctive ways locality requirements incompatible semantic superposition core refined concept distributed representation defined 
case symbolic representation locality requirement manifest principle compositionality requires compound representations identifiable basic components literally compound representations tokens generally contribution meaning compound occur 
example sentence cat mat contains token word cat token appears puts feline slant meaning sentence 
distinct aspects meaning sentence correspond local fashion distinct parts representation 
carries higher levels analysis paragraph example distinct parts content conveyed paragraph correspond distinct parts paragraph sentence tokens 
short symbolic representation part part correspondence content representation distributed representation correspondence part 
classical symbolic representation roughly get take digital local representations concatenate form complex structures 
distributed representation really different classical symbolic representation form basis alternative conception cognitive architecture 
hard say best collate interesting indications 
number considerations suggest distribution taken seriously 
starting bottom speak note knowledge way information stored brain suggests long term encoding distributed 
sure localization large scales finer levels analysis information stored superimposed fashion 
example knowledge underlying ability recognize human faces appears localized small area area possible identify distinct representations distinct faces
