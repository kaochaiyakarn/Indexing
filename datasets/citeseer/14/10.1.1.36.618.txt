section review existing annotation tools discuss suited construct personal information space speed privacy important issues 
traditional approach systems show document object model level new application program interfaces api provided commercial web browsers change architecture annotation systems 
implementation annotation system uses new technologies 
experiments showing annotations improve document access document clustering 
discuss works including document classification summarization related works 
web annotation systems architecture web annotation systems reviewed 
authors pointed new technologies document object model dom level needed design annotation systems 
specifications dom level released popular web browser implements current recommendations new exciting applications enhance browsing experience internet users 
describing details web annotation systems focus weaknesses detail new dom level specifications design new annotation systems 
discuss new challenges addressed annotation systems 
limits current web annotation systems annotation system usually consists modules view existing annotations second create new annotations third store annotations 
annotation parts anchor locate annotation document attributes include instance free comment author name 
interested inline annotation systems meaning annotations attached specific text document 
call text highlighted text 
implement module annotation systems intermediary resides browser internet 
role attach annotations documents requested browser displayed 
web browsers configured proxy intermediary implemented form proxy 
technically proxy requires little browser configuration user 
proxy intermediary limits 
firstly proxies contacted local document loaded browser local documents annotated 
secondly proxy needs parse document modify original content insert annotations 
knowledge annotation system designed parse scripts embedded web pages 
scripts generate content document 
important parsing procedures need cope new web standards xml 
problem proxy intermediaries privacy 
proxy seats browser internet spy requested url 
users able turn annotation system anytime 
removing proxy reconfiguring browser possible procedure tedious users 
original approach critlink yee proxy called mediator 
critlink browser configuration needed existing web browsers annotation tool 
system simply prefixing url crit org 
instance see annotated version www yahoo com simply change location crit org www yahoo com 
critlink server contacted retrieves requested document internet adds annotations attached modifies links prefixing crit org 
step ensures subsequent requests forwarded critlink server 
turn annotation system user needs remove crit org prefix url current document 
implementation full featured proxy technically feasible view existing annotations severe drawback happens comes creating new annotations 
proxy virtually control loaded pages 
user needs attach annotation specific text document system needs identify point document 
text sufficient may appear times document 
methods tried 
systems prompt user manually paste text dialog box checking appears complete document yee 
experiments real burden users 
systems require users load page annotated separate html editor user inserts annotation 
calculating difference new version original document content system able get proper annotation anchor attributes 
creating annotation challenging process user 
module storage annotations 
annotations may shared typical approach store remotely accessible server 
systems generally provide kinds annotations public group private annotations 
private annotations kept annotation server 
firstly design annotation system basically secondly annotation attributes easily changed public instance 
approach rises issue privacy 
contacting annotation server adds significant delay browsing internet 
evaluation existing annotation systems showed users feel comfortable wait want create personal annotations 
willing accept delays creating group public annotations 
document object model level improves web annotation systems despite disadvantages proxy intermediary annotation systems relied technology browser independent 
new technologies document object model level dynamic html change drastically design web annotation systems 
technology implemented popular commercial web browser internet explorer commercial products expression net document object model dom application easily manipulate content document 
compared old version dom level adds range objects 
range subpart document instance text selected user 
advantage annotation system immediate range object dom system precisely locate annotation anchor document 
range object important user selected text appears times document 
case annotation system needs precisely locate position selection compute occurrence selected 
unable insert annotation properly 
right occurrence annotation available www com www com www expression net com www com system dynamically change layout forcing browser reload entire document 
instance system may simply change color selected text 
compared existing systems advantages dom level quite clear users creating annotation easy selecting text document click special option browser 
experiment yawas showed xml files processed way 
manipulate dom annotation system needs get interface 
historically dom accessible scripting languages javascript 
scripts embedded documents able modify 
course help annotation system uses tricks automatically embed scripts page 
approach proxy intermediary inserts scripts page sent browser 
critlink yee 
better approach browser provide api making dom accessible external applications 
version internet explorer provides api 
external program written activex object interface access modify documents loaded browser 
object registers internet explorer 
new instance internet explorer launch instance activex object giving dom interface document subsequently loaded 
internet explorer provides event notification interfaces activex objects notified event occurring browser 
events events important annotation system 
notifies annotation system document requested user 
waiting document retrieved internet annotation system start retrieve annotations attached document knows url 
receives event annotation system modifies layout document insert annotations 
way dom accessible external applications expect major web browsers support functionality 
way get dom extend context menu internet explorer 
option associated script access dom 
annotation system uses method easier

automatic document clustering applied document set consisting documents annotation anchors 
hierarchical agglomerative clustering 
comparisons required preliminary results show annotation clustering better identifying similar documents compared full text clustering 
small clusters annotation clustering mixture methods way 
instance greater importance highlighted words 
similar approach successfully applied weiss greater weights words contained inside specific html tags title address 
initial clustering proposed users newly highlighted documents properly inserted existing classification 
studying annotations help 
problem occurs document highlighted time automatic classifier little information 
suggest boost classifier words highlighted classified documents 
give classifier information compute similarity documents 
existing classification scheme li suggested internet search engines automatic classifiers 
advantage existing search engine get meaningful category name manually selected 
classify document method selects significant words document issues query search engine 
significant words usually selected word frequency inverse document frequency 
search engine returns documents similar request category 
similarly highlighted texts significant words see classification changes 
expect user directed 
existing search engines find topic document approach combined traditional approach user defined categories considered 
yawas annotation attribute called document type 
examples include scientific home page discussion forum news 
user defined categories necessary exist existing search engines 
preliminary results showed annotations summarize documents 
research automatic document summarization lopez tombros demonstrated benefits query terms produce personalized document summaries 
similarly highlighted texts build user directed document summaries 
document summaries important information access simple concatenation highlighted texts proved useful experiments 
search engine annotation summaries decide document read 
experiment measure users speed accuracy classifying documents annotation summaries typical summaries title sentences documents 
phelps introduced robust hyperlinks deal problem broken urls 
signature consisting words computed document 
submitted query search engines signatures retrieve document url changed 
highlighted words help users understand content page investigation required test words compute robust hyperlinks order retrieve document url changed 
related different approaches proposed help users bookmark management 
marais li full text document indexed 
disk space available current personal computers shows feasibility idea 
search engine documents retrieved full text 
help people classify bookmarks proposed apply automatic document clustering 
noted clustering applied bookmark defined topics involved 
similar clustering method preliminary results showed automatic document clustering lead poor results applied large bookmark file documents 
clustering documents li marais provide automatic document classification search engines 
claim li automatic clustering may produce interesting clusters class labels necessary meaningful users 
search engine classify documents preferred category names manually selected 
experiment showed annotations helped human classifier create precise cluster labels compared names created full text documents 
highlighted texts choose category names 
problem current bookmark programs arises document urls change 
attempts deal specific problem broken urls 
review existing propositions appears phelps new proposition called robust hyperlinks 
similarly robust hyperlinks highlighted texts generate automatic query order retrieve document new url 
history tools proposed cockburn hightower reduce users disorientation browsing internet 
automatically bookmark pages draw map user navigation browsing session 
maps rapidly complex question usable 
current research provides little feedback issue 
represent documents challenging problem cockburn hightower 
thumbnail images document title 
believe highlighted texts greatly augment representation 
displaying navigational history user map display highlighted documents 
user request complete path displayed 
current implementation yawas stores parent url highlighted document 
page highlighted parent url compute navigational path local proxy intermediary overcome limitation
