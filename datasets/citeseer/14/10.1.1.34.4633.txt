information distributed securely network automatically new nodes come line information changes 
anonymous connections onion routing anonymous connections protocol independent exist phases connection setup data movement connection tear 
setup begins initiator creates onion defines path connection network 
onion recursively layered data structure specifies properties connection point route cryptographic control information different symmetric cryptographic algorithms keys data movement phase 
onion treated destination address onion routers establish anonymous connection 
onions appear differently onion router network observers 
goes data carried connections establish 
connection routes traverse arbitrary number ors 
single onion set route eleven hops 
longer routes require tunnelling onions connection 
route uses public key decrypt entire onion receives 
operation exposes cryptographic control information identity embedded onion 
pads embedded onion maintain fixed size sends 
connection established data sent directions 
data initiator repeatedly pre encrypted algorithms keys specified onion 
data moves anonymous connection removes layer encryption defined cryptographic control information onion defining route data arrives plaintext recipient 
layering occurs reverse order different algorithms keys data moving backward 
connection tear initiated middle needed 
information onions data network control sent onion routing network uniform sized cells 
cells arriving fixed time interval mixed reduce correlation network insiders 
likewise longstanding connections ors padded bandwidth limited foil external observers 
onion looks different connection layered public key cryptography 
similarly layering symmetric cryptography data phase cells appear different 
design resists traffic analysis effectively deployed mechanisms internet communication 
connection overhead onion routing overhead relatively small 
connection setup overhead typically second appears noticeable delays associated normal web connection setup internet 
computationally expensive public key cryptography connection setup phase 
public key decryption expensive encryption public key burden rests mainly onion routers option dedicated hardware acceleration justified 
modular design completely compatible doing public key operations hardware software test networks 
aside cryptography system code onion routing system code approved unlimited distribution 
data movement phase uses secret key symmetric cryptography faster 
furthermore symmetric encryption pipelined data throughput fast ordinary link encryption 
data latency affected number ors connection vary route length duration mix cycles 
access configurations exit policies proxies onion routers components run variety distributed configurations 
allows onion routing mesh wide variety operational policy environments 
consider possibilities access configurations 
ffl remote proxy access extreme proxies run remotely 
user encrypted connection trusted remote proxy onion routing protection utilized installing software inducing local computational overhead

initiator anonymous connection responder layers encryption anonymous connection initiator responder identify hide communication rest world 
build virtual private networks protected sites 
notice initiator trusts remote proxy conceal initiator wants communicate responder build anonymous connection network 
paragraph describes shift trust remote site initiator 
ffl customer isp access suppose example internet services provider isp runs funnel multiplexor accepts connections onion proxies running subscribers machines 
configuration users generate onions specifying path isp destination 
isp know initiates connection isp know customer communicating able see data content 
customer need trust isp maintain privacy 
furthermore isp common carrier carries data customers 
may relieve isp responsibility users communicating content conversations 
isp may may running 
running onion router difficult identify connections terminate customers serving routing point traffic 
hand simply runs funnel onion router possible identify connections terminating traffic load 
case isp probably depend variety service cost pricing considerations 
note configuration entry funnel established longstanding connection just neighboring 
cases funnel resides machine onion router establishing encrypted longstanding connection necessary funnel directly incorporated onion router 
ffl island access wants gain maximum protection afforded onion routing necessary local control onion router 
assuming serves intermediate node routing traffic data route hidden time volume information connections originating terminating locally 
course additional protection comes price having adequate internet bandwidth function way 
ffl proxy firewall access proxy onion router sit firewall sensitive site serve interface machines firewall external network 
connections machines firewall onion router protected means physical security 
complicate tracking traffic originating terminating sensitive enclave route data ors 
configuration represent system interface typical corporate government site 
connections machines firewall ors protected eavesdropping traffic analysis 
data stream appears clear public network data may carry identifying information communi cation private 
feature constructing onion routing 
onion router precisely proxy originating protected site knows source destination connection 
protects anonymity connections observers outside firewall simplifies enforcement monitoring compliance corporate governmental usage policy 
anonymous connections sensitive sites control ors effectively hides communication outsiders 
employing layering funnels ors firewalls incorporate traffic analysis resistance defense depth 
ffl local proxy firewall access possible hide route origination connections originating enclave protecting route application data transmitted enclave administrators 
arrangement onion routing connected users visible firewall connected applications running 
discussion describes various ways connection enter onion routing network 
exiting important 
responder connection firewall terminal resides responder arbitrary web server data stream sensitive initiator anonymized avoid exposing initiator 
example external attacker simply listen connections web server identify initiators connection 
point exiting network applies equally regardless configuration entrance access 
issues concerning connection exits network 
exit points set policies exiting traffic going application protocol run 
example onion router corporate firewall allow attempt remote login machines firewall 
allow email traffic exit site web traffic exit 
course exit limitations problem proxies attempting create connections policies available attempting build route 
database engine attached onion routers 
ensure changes information propagates entire network proxies construct routes 
inform neighboring ors changes network topology link state ensuring information propagates network 
way proxies date information possible potential routes 
greatly reduces chance bad connections attempted route 
system generates distributes information configured just flat network authentication relevant exit point onion router 
danger central failure hostile manipulation information 
difficult manipulate information cause routes pass compromised cooperating onion routers 
background comparisons mentioned chaum defines layered object routes data intermediate nodes mixes 
intermediate nodes may reorder delay pad traffic complicate traffic analysis 
mixes assumption single perfect mix adequately complicates traffic analysis sequence multiple mixes typically real mixes ideal 
mix applications mixes fixed order 
onion routers differ mixes indeterminate number mixes indeterminate order ways onion routers limited extent delay traffic node real time expectations applications demand socket connections 
onion routing access configurations onion routers entry points onion routing network traffic entering exiting nodes may may visible outsiders 
hard track packets may drop network node new packets may introduced node 
onion routing delay traffic extent mixes traffic ors multiplexed single channel link encrypted stream cipher
