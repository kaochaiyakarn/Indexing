normalizing disambiguating location names tagging phase identify locations new york city california mentioned map location unambiguous city state pair 
problems arise completing task include aliasing di erent names commonly location 
example san francisco referred sf 
relatively easy address problem country state level 
aliases quite limited compiled list hand 
cities resorted database united states postal service usps zip code service returns list variations corresponding city name 
example columbia university zip code obtain list names new york city including new york manhattan new york city ny city nyc interestingly 
incidentally usps standard form city new york 
repeatedly querying usps database di erent zip codes build list city name aliases corresponding normal form group

evaluate quality estimated geographical scopes need compare ideal subjective scopes

example geographical scope resource california compute egs say california new york city metric mark answer completely wrong 
similarly consider case egs computation consists say california cities include california state perfect answer 
traditional classification accuracy metrics consider estimate completely wrong technique managed identify cities right state part geographical scope observations mind adapt precision recall metrics information retrieval field yield metrics believe appropriate problem
