motivation ideal media objects images selected classified clustered conceptually similar images grouped content 
requires image content described coherent semantic domain model relying keywords commercial image database systems 
zdonik proposes image databases fall category incremental bottom databases description images predefined fit prescriptive database schema conventional databases incrementally evolve link image instances schema evolve schema describing image instances 
image data captured little form deal substructure 
applications determine appropriate substructure additional substructure generates schema 
schema exist connections instances 
example concept uk prime minister exist images instances prime minister connected concepts 
instances annotations linking schema incrementally elaborated content revealed required retrieved 
image man describe elaborate description include aircraft elaborate name man 
instances incomplete varying completeness description descriptions extended image vehicle politician 
images collect annotations kind incremental support essential 
flexibility required image may reused different application perspectives classified different unpredictable possibly contradictory interpretations contents 
operations aim support include ffl semantic annotations 
annotation semantic data covering meaning images documents linking collection domain concepts ffl dynamic classification reuse 
flexible annotations allow reuse information different perspectives image john major front aircraft may thought image man politician person machine ffl unpredictability ffl incremental elaboration reclassification incompleteness 
incremental elaboration brings cost maintaining consistency descriptions 
ffl imprecise similarity retrieval annotations 
imprecise incomplete descriptions image content naturally mean imprecise inexact matching queries 
query example retrieve images content similar common image content retrieval systems 
static hierarchies coding schemes approaches order provide annotations structure 
keywords keyword systems attempt introduce coherent annotations go introducing common shared vocabulary 
uncontrolled tend provide annotations inflexible difficult extend lack structure 
coding schemes improvement coding scheme terms arranging concepts static hierarchy terms hierarchy annotation 
hierarchy provide structure annotations 
example scheme system developed means describing content works art 
consists large static hierarchy containing entries unique code identifying concept place hierarchy textual correlate piece text describing concept 
hierarchy concepts indexed keywords allowing multiple entry points hierarchy 
contains definitions including objects persons events situations ideas 
mirrors medical world approach terminology years static hierarchies icd snomed 
hierarchies suffer deficiencies detailed schemes big navigation difficult data entry results large picking lists small levels detail captured insufficient 
order build usable medical data entry systems pen pad galen projects model richer structure needed compositional model allowed terminology built atomic primitive concepts relations 
hierarchy suffers problems encountered medical coding schemes particular semantics hierarchy unclear 
example beneath code door wide variety children including closing door

galen experiences bechhofer goble hierarchy simply organisational things placed connection necessarily subsumption relationships forms basis concept hierarchies description logics

grail specifically devised medical terminologies influenced range term constructors 
certain constructors dls particular disjunction negation limited form cardinality restriction provided
