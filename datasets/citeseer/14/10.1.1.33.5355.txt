goal investigations find reliable laser point tracking works computing time required purpose 
respect reliability values measured 
percentage hits fraction frames laser point recognized correctly 
second percentage spurious detections means fraction wrongly reported locations 
seconds initial learning phase pattern laser point turned achieved hit rates low 
fortunately practice hit rate means average locations delivered half frame rate 
frame rates typically lie frames locations delivered 
rate acceptable working system
