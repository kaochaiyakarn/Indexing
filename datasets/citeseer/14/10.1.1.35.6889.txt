overview driven set observations concerning nature human computer interaction regards information systems 
observations behavior posing query search engine goal directed behavior 
view posing initial query search engine step plan satisfies goal finding information certain topic 
finding information usually service goal construct library information scripts script sense schank abelson associated satisfying user goals information need 
scripts knowledge structures house information highly routine situations 
appropriate context serve purpose making strong predictions situations sequences events 
ima knowledge information scripts means ability understand predict behavior allowing automatically complete associated tasks behalf user 
second observation standard information systems documents environments produced consumed manipulated highly structured regular 
mention just regularities 
documents gross morphology letter newspaper article invitation memo corresponds directly document function 

document fine structures addresses headings paragraphs titles prevalent known semantics 

everyday computer applications serve particular easily attributable function word processing programs constructing documents presentation packages building presentations 

everyday computer applications formed interaction semantics bookmarking page means interesting user 
structure regularity semantics associated regularity environment particularly analysis computer program 
setting strongly structured human behavior highly structured regular 
follows regularity environment user interaction known inform task understanding user behavior 
third observation commonly information retrieval systems interfaces particularly easy computer challenging human 
design demand information requests reduced small number key features task people particularly strong 
likewise information retrieval systems generate regular output organized ways usually far easier machine manipulate human user 
aspects information retrieval systems argue strongly mediating agent creates queries interprets results 
fourth observation bring problem helping users access information viewing search part larger task grounds explicit queries context typically inaccessible traditional information retrieval systems 
context inaccessible traditional information systems require users context explicit expressing terms search keys relevance feedback salton buckley users simply unwilling unable 
study search engine queries showed average users queries words long jansen 
study shows relevance feedback rarely 
needless say critical contextual information elided queries highly ambiguous 
hand access user task context explicit traditional information systems behalf user 
example user browsing page construction equipment enters query caterpillar home page system return pages include links large manufacturing companies pages fuzzy insects 
unfortunately query current internet search engines return pages fuzzy insects precisely systems isolated user task context 
bridge gap information systems implicit context making context explicit traditional information systems 
observations implementing watson ima observes user interaction everyday applications netscape navigator microsoft internet explorer microsoft word attempts automatically fulfill user information need querying common internet information sources automatically 
architecture information management assistant observes users interact everyday applications 
uses explicit task model interpret user actions anticipate user information need 
content analyzer employs model content document application order produce content representation document user currently manipulating 
representation fed resource selector selects information sources basis perceived information need content document hand description available information sources 
cases results information request sent external sources 
result list returned form html page interpreted filtered result processor set result similarity metrics 
resulting list user separate window 
explicit request directed system ima uses knowledge user task context generate information request sent appropriate sources 
cases inappropriate automatically query information systems filter results automatically generated information requests user form button pressed executes search presents results demand 
implementation preliminary version architecture realized watson ima built 
watson application adapters gain access application event model internal representation document 
adapters produce document representation sent watson application deemed appropriate 
knowledge kind information need anticipated watson selects appropriate sources transforms original document representation query sent selected information adapters 
information adapter translates query source specific query language executes search 
information adapters responsible collecting results gathered clustered heuristic result similarity metrics eliminate redundant results 
process demonstrated 
heuristic query construction order retrieve related documents user writing browsing watson construct query content document hand eventually sent external information sources real time 
external information sources typically employ vector space model performing information retrieval salton wong yang 
systems employing model require queries form sequence search terms keywords 
heuristics useful constructing algorithm extracts keywords document 
words included list search terms 
automatically removed information systems 
second words frequently representative document content 
third emphasized words representative document content words 
fourth words appear close top page representative document content words appear words small fonts intentionally words words lists ordered 
documents represented terms ordered list words styles 
words normal emphasized de emphasized list items 
watson application adapters internal representation exposed application classify words groups detecting appropriate structures html documents internet explorer word properties provided microsoft word 
adapter sends typed message containing sequence words type watson application 
watson string basic lexical analyzer sends term weighting algorithm 
simultaneously watson sends tokens array conceptual unit detectors described 
pseudocode displayed describes term weighting algorithm 
pass terms eliminated words computed general statistics 
point defined maximum number times word appeared document defined total number terms words document constant factor usually defined pos contains list position style pairs word intuitively preliminary weight term particular place page varies inversely square position 
metric improves document length increases prompting addition numerator proportional fraction square total number terms reflect fact 
term final weight sum weights term list item 
term list item de emphasized weight simply number times occurred 
term emphasized weight doubled 
resulting term weight pairs sorted top terms form query sent selected information sources 
heuristic result processing results returned traditional information systems contain copies page similar pages server ima filter results add user feeling information overload maes 
similarities accounted useful pages returned traditional information systems may missed 
constantly face risk annoying user word collected position style pos weight weight list item style de emphasized style weight emphasized style weight weight weight weight weight term weighting algorithm watson suggesting documents user writing 
helping 
watson collects search results clusters similar pages displaying single representative cluster user browse 
cluster redundant results watson uses pieces information sources return documents title url 
employs heuristic similarity metrics pieces information 
titles similar large percentage words common 
certainty similarity increases function square length title words 
second urls similar internal directory structure 
certainty similarity increases proportionally function square length url directory elements 
combination similarity metrics generally sufficient approximating uniqueness documents returned 
cluster computed single url cluster 
clustering algorithm incremental 
new response arrives network immediately processed resulting list suggestions updated 
suggestion list collected incrementally computed detailed expensive processing list url validity checking performed background separate thread 
call approach process 
table shows results clustering responses generated page java standardization 
longer entries deleted brevity 
notice number mirror sites logical duplicates may different urls file 
example presenting user pages originally returned watson presents effectively removing duplicates mirrors 
leveraging structure provide special purpose information watson recognizes opportunities provide specialpurpose information garnered queries information repositories 
watson facility detecting lexically regular conceptually atomic items addresses names providing user interface useful specialpurpose information resulting query specific kinds online information sources 
order detect conceptual units addresses captions special purpose search watson runs array simple detectors parallel 
detector finite state automaton accepting sequence tokens representing conceptual unit 
item detected watson presents user common action item form button press 
example page contains address watson provides direct link online map generator 
watson detects opportunities performing special purpose search context document composition 
example user inserts image fill microsoft word document watson uses listed words form query vista commercial implementation webseer frankel image search engine 
users drag drop images document 
query context watson allows users enter explicit queries 
user submits query watson combines new query terms previously constructed contextual query concatenating form single query 
way watson brings previously gathered context information bear directly process servicing user explicit query 
example user viewing document construction equipment enters query toy watson return list pages toy construction equipment
