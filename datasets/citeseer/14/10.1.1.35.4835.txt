exploiting geographical location information web pages orkut orkut cs stanford edu junghoo cho cho cs stanford edu hector garcia molina hector cs stanford edu luis gravano gravano cs columbia edu narayanan shivakumar cs stanford edu information resources web relevant primarily limited geographical communities 
instance web sites containing information restaurants apartment relevant primarily web users geographical proximity locations 
contrast information resources relevant broader geographical community 
instance line newspaper may relevant users united states 
unfortunately geographical scope web resources largely ignored web search engines 
case identifying exploiting geographical location information web sites web search engines rank resources geographically sensitive fashion addition traditional information retrieval strategies 
consider compute geographical location web pages 
subsequently consider exploit information specific proof concept application implemented java discuss examples 
world wide web provides uniform access information available globe 
web sites line stores banking institutions global interest web users world wide 
web sites contain information primarily interest web users geographical community bay area palo alto 
unfortunately current web search engines consider geographical scope pages computing query results 
consequently search engine query results include resources geographically relevant user issued query 
instance finding restaurants apartment near specific regions simple task current web search engines 
consider scenario database geographical scope zip code state entities restaurants newspapers web presence 
exploit information variety ways improve search engines web user queries search engine italian restaurants search engine identifies user 
example user may registered information search engine profile yahoo com excite com services 
search engine uses information rank italian restaurants distance restaurant user location returning italian restaurants world 
note strategy equivalent user querying search engine italian restaurant palo alto query restaurants areas close palo alto mountain view menlo park 
course additional information restaurant quality pricing information available search engine factor dimensions ranking

identify resources web user wants find important web pages web pages authority topic 
reason web search engines google hits count number distinct hyperlinks point web page indication important web page rationale heuristic larger number web users hyperlink web page higher importance page 
approach useful certain applications believe count indication global relevance site 
instance stanford university students palo alto residents links stanford daily daily campus newspaper covers news relevant local community 
number hyperlinks globally important newspaper new york times may smaller simply concentration web sites stanford university palo alto largest world 
believe exploiting geographical information web sites estimate global web entity data mining market analysts interested exploiting geographical information target product sales 
web provides new source information 
instance market analyst identifies web data outdoor activities hiking popular residents bay area seattle analyst may recommend opening additional sporting goods stores areas 
principal problems arise try exploit geographical location information entities restaurants 
compute geographical information 
section discusses techniques determining location web pages 
techniques primarily di er easy compute location information versus accurate corresponding information 
exploit information 
database location information second question information 
discussed earlier applications information 
section concentrates application discusses initial visualization prototype developed specific task 
computing geographical scopes ideally identify geographical scope web pages 
approach computing geographical locations human hand classify pages 
course approach prohibitively expensive 
need explore automatic ways attaching geographical scopes line resources 
information extraction automatically analyze web pages extract geographic entities palo alto area codes zip codes 
user types search terms search engine engine denote geographical location close textual proximity search terms location search terms 
instance consider web page words italian restaurant menlo park 
web user palo alto searches italian restaurants associate menlo park closest geographical location search terms italian restaurant particular web page 
search engine rank web page close user palo alto 
approach complementary approach 
approach attempts capture geographical scope web resources actual usage just words places mentioned 
network ip address analysis related approach determining geographical scope web resources focus location hosting web sites 
define geographical scope web page location web site resides 
instance consider web page www db stanford edu 
url query database assume web page relevant palo alto stanford regions 
side note database despite repeated requests internic icann internet domain registries 
unix tools whois traceroute identify www db stanford edu located palo alto california 
approach su ers problems 
firstly heuristic cases 
instance geographical scope web page hosted www aol com correspondence aol web server located 
secondly www db stanford edu located stanford content may globally relevant 
ip addresses allocated ad hoc fashion usually inherent connection ip address physical location 
context tools whois traceroute give location site 
tools slow typically take seconds respond web site 
tools scale need find locations hundreds thousands web sites 
section show find location web page accurately ciently especially educational institutions edu extension 
describe exploit information determine geographical scope web resources 
prototype application discussed section variety applications benefit geographical location information 
section explore map web page geographical location originated 
mappings understand geographical scope web resources 
developed proof concept prototype shows geographical information determine web site 
map web pages geographical location prototype uses number databases downloaded internet 
needed databases tools whois slow compute geographic locations hundreds thousands web sites
