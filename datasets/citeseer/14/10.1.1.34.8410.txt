generation affect synthesized speech janet cahn mit media technology laboratory ames street cambridge ma phone generation affect synthesized speech compared human speech synthesized speech distinguished insufficient intelligibility inappropriate prosody inadequate expressiveness 
serious drawbacks conversational computer systems 
intelligibility basic intelligible phonemes necessary word recognition 
prosody intonation melody rhythm clarifies syntax semantics aids discourse flow control 
expressiveness affect provides information speaker mental state intent revealed word content 
explores improvements affective component synthesized speech 
embodied affect editor program intended show variations affect generated synthetic speech point way improving recognizability naturalness affect 
success generating recognizable affect confirmed experiment intended affect perceived majority presentations 
affect concern speech synthesis theoretical practical reasons 
role human speech provide context utterances interpreted signal speaker intentions 
play role synthesized speech 
practically addition controllable affect allow synthesized speech application expressiveness appropriate example tools presentation dramatic material information giving systems synthesizers speech handicapped 
prerequisites incorporate affect synthesized speech identify acoustic correlates emotions choose representation allows systematic control correlates 
discussed section 
speech correlates emotion speech correlates emotion identified studies speech signal perceptual responses emotional speech 
primary affect fundamental frequency duration 
associated speech phenomena explained effect emotion physiology 
arousal sympathetic nervous system fear anger joy heart rate blood pressure increase mouth dry occasional muscle 
speech correspondingly loud fast enunciated high frequency energy 
arousal nervous system boredom sadness heart rate blood pressure decrease increases 
speech slow low pitched high frequency energy weak 
representation effect emotion speech representation speech correlates emotion proceed speaker model acoustic model 
generative approach effects emotion physiology speech derived representation speaker mental state intentions 
second describes primarily listener hears 
acoustic model simpler requires knowledge 
perceptual parameters explicit model easily manipulated test perceptual responses 
model incorporated affect editor 
parameters acoustic model grouped categories pitch timing voice quality articulation 
pitch parameters describe features 
timing parameters control speed rhythm combination word stress silence 
pitch timing parameters describe features words phrases 
contrast voice quality parameters affect features speech signal 
articulation parameters control variations precise 
pitch parameters ffl accent shape steepness intonation contour site pitch accented syllable 
ffl average pitch average utterance 
ffl contour slope slope increasing level decreasing contour 
ffl final lowering steepness decrease falling contours rise rising contours questions 
ffl pitch range distance speaker lowest highest utterance 
ffl line term borrowed generative intonation 
specifies returned high low pitch excursion 
timing parameters word stressed noticeably high low pitch accented word 
significant pitch occurs syllable carrying greatest lexical stress 
ffl exaggeration degree pitch accented words receive exaggerated duration means emphasis 
exaggeration currently unimplemented synthesizer introduced side effects 
ffl fluent pauses frequency pausing syntactic semantic units 
ffl hesitation pauses frequency pausing syntactic semantic unit ffl speech rate rate speech 
speech rate affects number words spoken minute pause lengths 
ffl stress frequency percent stressed words words utterance 
voice quality parameters ffl amount noise may non fricative phonemes vowels example 
ffl ratio low high frequency energy 
ffl vocal fold vibration air flow vocal cords 
speech older speakers 
ffl loudness loudness 
ffl pause discontinuity smoothness pause onset 
ffl pitch discontinuity distance successive values intonation contour 
ffl regularities successive glottal pulses 
parameter currently effect output 
sole articulation parameter ffl precision degree 
precision expanded specified separately phonemes distinguished means production place articulation 
acoustical model significant features 
parameter values quantified scale centered ranges 
allows simple comparisons effects different emotions 
new affective created changing parameter values 
additionally perceptual thresholds may tested incremental changes 
note parameter values arranged mid range value range quantifies neutral affect extreme values represent parameter maximum minimum influence respectively 
implementation affect quantifiers straightforward 
moving values away neutral settings corresponds affective coloration moving values closer corresponds 
input input affect editor annotated utterance meant represent plausible output text generation program 
phrases utterance grouped roles case frame descriptions 
example subj thought obj action really meant additionally word annotated part speech probability receiving significant stress 
affect editor assigns word stress word annotation determines pause locations shape terminal contour phrase annotation 
discussion affect editor implements transfer function acoustical description emotional speech synthesized speech 
tool effects different emotions speech quantified correlations acoustic parameters investigated 
experiment simple experiment performed neutral sentences synthesized different affects random order subjects 
subjects heard sentences finished 
saw name 
thought really meant 
going city 
look picture 
angry fearful surprised sad glad affective coloring 
hypothesis parts affect conveyed voice recognized despite sentence semantics semantically acoustically similar emotions confused 
fact sentence semantics color judgments 
example sentence thought really meant rarely perceived glad surprised 
emotions sadness consistently recognized 
sense characteristics soft slow halting speech minimal high frequency energy distinct 
emotions recognized little presentations mistaken similar emotions anger disgust surprise additional 
number correct recognitions significantly chance correct 
errors random followed pattern errors identifying affect human speech 
experiment answered broadly affirmative question recognizable affect generated synthesized speech 
synthesizer considerations effects acoustic representation synthesizer independent parameters interpreted synthesizer drives 
mapping synthesizer far involves mappings acoustic parameters synthesizer settings 
parameters represented parameter set implemented software 
contour slope approximated assigning high word utterance pauses added inserting silence character smoothness pause onset effected inserting phonemes prior silence precision articulation achieved phoneme substitutions additions 
chosen allows control aspects pitch timing voice quality articulation 
limitations unclear emotion poorly specified correctly specified poorly reproduced 
limitations kinds side effects limited capabilities 
side effect expressing word phonemic form lower specified text 
word stress markings cause primarily local perturbations affect intonation contour word subsequent word stresses 
average pitch raised voice begins sound different speaker speaker raising voice 
side effect occurs pitch range average pitch values interdependent independent 
side effects remedied implementing intonational description system primarily local effects tone annotation developed pierrehumbert colleagues 
affect synthesis easier addition features implemented software affect editor particularly ability specify precision articulation pitch contour slope 
shows recognizable natural sounding affect produced imitating synthesized speech effects emotion human speech 
importantly tool exploring needed affect generating system 
effectiveness increased synthesizers accurately reproduce affect editor specifications
