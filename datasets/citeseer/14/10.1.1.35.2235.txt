identity philosophical literature identity condition ic arbitrary property usually defined suitable relation satisfying formula identity equivalence relation follows restricted equivalence relation 
example property person seen carrying ic relations having ssn having thesame fingerprints assumed satisfy 
discussed detail guarino welty formulation problems opinion 
problem related need distinguishing supplying ic simply carrying ic non rigid properties student carry ics inheriting supplied subsuming rigid properties person 
intuition person student different times different schools ic allegedly supplied student say having registration number may local certain experience 
supply global condition identity satisfying sufficient condition necessary 
second problem regards nature relation ic index respect time account difference synchronic diachronic identity 
deciding property carries ic may difficult finding necessary sufficient identity hard especially natural kinds artifacts 
reasons introduce notion identity conditions characteristics supplied rigid properties ii reformulate relation terms formula explicitly takes different times account allowing distinction synchronic time diachronic different times identity iii sufficient necessary 
definition rigid property formula containing free variables say carries ic iff conditions verified definition necessary ic carried xy definition sufficient ic carried 
formulas guarantees bound identity certain sortal arbitrary identity needed guarantee conjunct rel tautological ensures trivially false 
ics inherited hierarchy properties sense example necessary ic hold replacing 
definition non rigid property carries ic iff subsumed rigid property carrying 
definition property carrying ic marked meta property 
definition property supplies ic iff rigid ii carries iii carried properties subsuming 
means inherits different compatible ics multiple properties counts supplying ic 
definition property supplying ic marked meta property 
letter mnemonic identity

supplying ic analogous defining equality predicate class object oriented language ics overridden subproperty merely augmented 
see identity constraints section discussion 
definition property carrying ic called sortal strawson 
notice recognize property sortal forced know ic carries shall see distinguishing sortals non sortals start bringing order taxonomies 
unity addressing means certain property carry unity condition uc clarify means certain object uc 
definition equivalence relation 
time object contingent read formula follows time part bound parts 
words expresses condition maximal self connectedness suitable relation generalized connection 
depending ontological nature generalized connection relation may distinguish main kinds unity concrete entities having spatio temporal location topological unity kind topological connection piece coal lump coal morphological unity shape ball constellation functional unity hammer examples show prevents having parts wholes different uc 
foundation theory scope 
define stronger notion assuming uc hold object existence assuming unity essential property definition equivalence relation 
object intrinsic time exists contingent 
important object atomic proper parts intrinsic identity relation 
position state definition property carries unity condition iff exists equivalence relation instances intrinsic wholes 
notice definition imply second order existential quantification order get relation simply relation part ontology important clear carrying uc imply carrying necessary ic 
due way definition formulated 
see suppose carries uc 
may think persistence condition time candidate necessary ic satisfies 
fails satisfy qualify necessary identity condition uc persistence condition identity condition 
rigidity situations important distinguish properties carry common uc instances properties instances intrinsic wholes 
shall see example kind may legal agent instances intrinsic wholes people companies single relation persons companies may different ucs 
amount matter usually example kind instances intrinsic wholes 
define definition property anti unity instance property intrinsic 
course implies 
dependence final meta property employ formal ontological tool notion dependence 
general notion various forms variations discussed detail simons 
shall introduce specific kind dependence call external notional dependence simply external dependence simons notional dependence 
intuitively say property externally dependent property instances necessarily instance exist part constituent example parent externally dependent child parent having child person externally dependent heart body person heart part constituted body 
formal account definition requires definition constitution relationship turn non extensional mereology see simons book 
suffice say constitutes share basic parts existentially dependent exist existing 
example castle lump bricks constituted formed constituent parts castle exist lump bricks existing vice versa 
property externally dependent property marked constraints assumptions discuss constraints follow definitions 
distinguish kinds constraints largely overlooked practical cases guarino guarino welty 
concrete examples discussed 
take arbitrary properties 
rigidity constraints subsume constraint follows immediately definitions reported table 
shall see means person agent subsume 
identity constraints subsume properties incompatible ics disjoint 
constraint follows immediately definitions second deserves comment 
important point difference different incompatible ics related fact inherited specialized taxonomies 
consider domain geometrical figures example property polygon subsumes triangle 
necessary sufficient ic polygons having edges angles 
hand additional necessary sufficient ic triangles having edges internal angle common note condition necessary polygons 
properties different ics ic common extensions disjoint 
hand consider amount matter person 
admit mereological extensionality persons replace parts incompatible ics disjoint case say person amount matter 
unity constraints subsume subsume properties incompatible ucs disjoint 
constraints trivially follow definitions 
example suppose wonder vase subsumed amount clay 
may think vase amount clay just property satisfying suitable uc 
case intrinsic remain amount clay vase crashed 
analysis ucs brings light common misuse subsumption relation fact constituted amounts clay subsumed
