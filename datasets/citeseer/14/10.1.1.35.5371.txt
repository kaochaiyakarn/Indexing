consider problem formal ontologies providing semantics declarative languages way useful enabling automated knowledge exchange 
formal ontologies proposed gruber solution managing inherent heterogeneity knowledge different sources 
different approaches vary definition formal ontology ranging taxonomic hierarchies classes campbell vocabularies terms defined human readable text sets formal constraining axioms gruber 
distinction level commitment communicating agents respect shared ontology varying having agents commit single common ontology standardization approach having network mediators facilitators enable translation agents different ontologies shave gray 
purpose adopt logical theory view ontology constraining axioms play crucial role defining semantics 
allow communicating agents declarative languages ontologies require existence common ontology expressive interpret concepts agents ontologies 
require declarative language function specified converts sentences sentences order language 
ofcourse limits method applicability languages strictly expressive fol 
examples questions want address consider declarative language construct mother bill anne 
models construct look 
consider problem translating sets sentences declarative languages 
exactly mean say set sentences translation set sentences 
simplest case just order language considering sets sentences obvious solution say translation set consequences cn cn equivalently share set models 
extend saying partial translation consequences consequences cn cn equivalently models models 
unfortunately direct extension idea sets sentences different order languages way 
problem intuitively similar concepts ones translatable representations languages combinations functions predicates different arities functions language predicates combinations thereof 
models sets sentences different languages different sets sentences intuitively equivalent 
different arbitrary declarative languages defining translation harder don notion model 
tries specify way defining models sets sentences arbitrary declarative languages models define translation fashion language situation 
implicit assumptions consider declarative language construct mother bill anne

approach allow define partial translation way prohibit translating bits pieces information expressive languages expressive ones 
prefer semantics mother bill anne universe includes anne bill persons relation holds bill anne pairs semantics fol usually defined 
temptation define relation

models set sentences mother bill anne fact models set mother bill anne 
allow wanted structures include different persons considered bill anne cathy bill anne anne cathy 
allow unwanted models creep bill anne bill anne anne anne 
bill anne cathy bill anne bill cathy 
bill anne cathy bill anne anne cathy cathy bill 
problem implicit assumptions language fact person mother different mothers assumptions need explicit order define correct set models mother bill anne 
making assumptions explicit known ai building domain ontology gruber holds promise enabling knowledge exchange 
considerations lead explicitly constructing ontology models sentence mother bill anne models theory having axioms sentence image ontology models mother bill anne 

give models wanted help translation 
language defines ontology relation conceivably automated translation procedure identify predicates mutually translatable translate mother hood predicates satisfy ontology 
example successor predicate holds integer number successor satisfies axioms automated translation procedure consider partial translation mother 
way successor relation satisfies additional constraints fact bijective function opposed surjective 
better idea share ontology 
sharing ontologies greatly simplify task semantic automated translation procedure additional benefit simplifying process writing ontologies enabling reuse existing components
