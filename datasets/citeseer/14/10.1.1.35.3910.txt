roc representation provost fawcett largely responsible introducing roc analysis kdd ml communities :10.1.1.34.9927
extensively signal detection earned name receiver operating characteristics abbreviated roc 
swets showed broader applicability demonstrating advantages evaluating diagnostic systems 
roc analysis just single value accuracy pair values recorded different costs class frequencies 
signal detection called hit rate false alarm rate 
kdd ml communities called true positive rate fraction positives correctly classified false positive rate fraction negatives misclassified 
pair values produces point roc space false positive rate coordinate true positive rate coordinate 
classifiers parameters different settings produce different roc points 
example classifier produces probabilities example class naive bayes classifier threshold parameter biasing final class selection :10.1.1.15.7095
plotting roc points produced varying parameters produces roc curve classifier 
typically discrete set points including connected line segments 
parameter exist algorithms decision trees modified include costs produce different points 
alternatively class frequencies training set changed sampling simulate change class priors misclassification costs

cost graph average clear meaning average normalised expected cost assuming classifier pcf value best available 
notably provost roc averaging method indicated dotted curve gives higher normalised expected costs pcf values 
due average including suboptimal classifiers 
pooling methods averaging roc curves choosing classifiers tp produce different results give higher normalised expected costs compared cost graph averaging method 
estimating expected performance classifier average selection procedure curve ultimately select individual classifier 
far compared curves explicitly mentioning selection procedure implicitly assuming selection procedure inherent lower envelope cost graph roc convex hull point selected optimal pcf value 
case average normalised expected cost appropriate 
mean averages incorrect 
different selection procedure appropriate different performance criteria 
provost averaging method appropriate performance criterion calls classifier selection fp criterion 
suboptimal selection procedure just seen different averages curves result different selection procedures due different ways deciding point curve correspond point curve 
selection procedure necessary compare curves quantitatively nature quantitative comparison involves summing difference performance corresponding points 
selection method commonly comparing learning algorithms parameter

limitations limitation common roc analysis investigated situation classes 
ideas readily extend classes main advantage approach ease human understandability 
higher dimensional functions notoriously difficult visualise number dimensions increases quadratically number classes 
due duality representations little merit situation 
high dimensional space projected dimensional space improved understandability advantage 
limitation investigated commonly metrics evaluating classifier performance lift 
interesting avenue research alternative dualities metrics
