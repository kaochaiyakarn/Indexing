geographic space time tightly coupled linkage space time aspect naive geography deserves special attention

geographic information frequently incomplete setting geographic reasoning constraint reasoning geographic space typically deal incomplete information 
people draw sufficiently precise completing information intelligently applying default rules frequently common sense 
number cognitive studies provided evidence people may employ hierarchically organized schemes reason geographic space compensate missing information hirtle mcnamara 
people multiple conceptualizations geographic space thinking geographic space people typically employ different concepts change frequently 
conceptualizations space may reflect differences perceptual cognitive space gale may different geometrical properties continuous vs discrete egenhofer herring frank mark 
dependency scale difference types operations people typically employ raised motivation distinguishing different types spaces 
geographic space multiple levels detail aspect representing geographic space orthogonal multiple conceptualizations geographic space 
conceptualization geographic space may levels granularity appropriate problem solving different levels detail 
cartographic applications aspect considered part scale buttenfield 
naive view geographic space implies processing query detailed representation provide precise query result 
boundaries entities fact naive geography models geographic space perceived people strongly reflected way boundaries represented 
uniform view boundary established agree model physical entities 
simple configurations national boundaries may diverse interpretations countries involved agree extent territories 
conventionally political subdivisions modeled partition space boundary separates nation land neighbor 
neighbors may different perspective boundary belongs country 
boundary neighboring countries may considered pair boundaries 
smith argues philosophical point view may geographic situations boundary adjacent areas asymmetric 
examples cites situations country recognize existence national boundary neighbor country considered valid boundary 
political subdivisions certainly cases multiple views boundaries may occur 
case land parcels question owns boundary adjacent parcels 
topology matters metric refines geographic space topology considered class information metric properties distances shapes refinements frequently exactly captured 
ample evidence people organize geographic space topological information retained fairly precisely capturing relationships inclusion coincidence left right lynch stevens coupe riesbeck 
people biases north south east west directions people mental maps directions distances frequently quite gross simplifications particular preferences alignments north south east west directions 
despite exposure maps satellite images ignore geographic reality 
instance global scale south america considered due south north america 
likewise people latitudes trying compare cities north america europe tversky 
misconceptions similar stevens coupe explained hierarchical conceptualization geographic space 
potential source errors climate comparisons equation northern hemisphere means north warmer equates south may indicate factors geographic location may influence estimations directions 
biases strict cardinal directions appear judgments east coast frequently believed due north south mark 
misconceptions may surprising consequences people interact information systems 
example people requesting satellite image south state maine image archive expect receive image covers parts new hampshire massachusetts frank 
puzzled get water 
people tend similar biases north south directions right angles navigation may slight deviations norm consequently perform poorly wayfinding 
distances asymmetric euclidean geometry includes axiom distance point point equal distance naive geographic space premise frequently violated 
distances thought lengths paths earth surface frequently seen measure long takes get place kosslyn 
shortest path may multiple interpretations terms distance time fuel consumption toll 
path opposite directions chosen points distance people perceive may golledge terrain may influence fast travel traffic rush hours may slow travel direction 
distance applies measure positions geographic space extends concepts captures conceptual closeness 
example water bodies pond conceptually closer lake sea find conceptual differences pond ocean pond lake 
shorter distance similar instances 
distances concepts frequently asymmetric implying induced similarity asymmetric papadias similar necessarily similar distance inferences local global geographic distances thought local covering neighborhood points interest involving locations remote objects 
common coordinate systems origins equator distance differences calculated differences lengths equator greenwich 
far bangor maine maine distant bangor equator remote bangor greenwich 
goodchild 
similar way distinction north south east west related frame remote origin 
despite convenience coordinate calculations alternative spatial systems needed support naive geography 
systems pay attention neighborhood relations demonstrated measurement systems coordinate calculations resort inference supported deductive geographic databases sharma 
distances don add easily reasoning distances networks geographic space underlies formalisms differ considerably standard calculus 
usually adds lengths segments path irrespective values obtain length entire path 
method provides unreasonable results cases values added differ large amounts 
instance distance airports bangor maine santa barbara california approximately kilometers 
computing travel distance university maine uc santa barbara little sense add relatively short legs campuses respective airports kilometers kilometers distance claim took kilometers get campus
