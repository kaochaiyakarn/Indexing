agent components steve 
steve consists modules implemented soar laird newell rosenbloom newell handles high level cognitive processing second handles sensorimotor processing 
roughly speaking cognitive module repeatedly chooses steve action sensorimotor module provides steve perception world carries chosen action 
provide perception cognitive module sensorimotor module continually monitors messages components 
messages describe changes virtual world terms objects attributes actions taken humans mouse click particular object student current field view objects see current time measured real time clock 
soar decision cycle roughly times second soar module asks current state world important events occurred request action taken student cognitive module chooses appropriate action sends action sensorimotor module turn sends appropriate lower level messages components order implement action 
steve repertoire actions currently includes object manipulation pressing buttons visual attention looking objects gestures pointing objects speech 
currently experimenting physical realizations steve 
simplest virtual hand manipulate point objects 
example figures show steve pressing button grasping object pointing object air compressor 
developing methods steve appear full human jack software developed university pennsylvania badler phillips webber 
example shows steve agent represented human watching dynamic gaze control demonstration steve agent represented hand 
full human visually obtrusive difficult control representation may appropriate demonstrating spatial skills allows wider variety nonverbal communication steve students 
interaction steve student steve interact students ways demonstrate perform task monitor student performing task providing assistance requested 
steve shift gracefully modes 
primary difference demonstration monitoring steve student control choosing executing task actions 
regardless control steve demonstrating monitoring steve maintain plan completing current task 
obvious case demonstration steve select execute actions complete task 
case monitoring steve able advise student asked appropriate action able rationalize advice terms action helps complete task 
steve uses standard plan representation russell norvig 
plan consists set steps primitive action push button complex action plan 
second may ordering constraints steve pressing button steve grasping dipstick steve pointing indicator light steve agent watching steps constraints define partial order steps 
role steps plan represented set causal links mcallester rosenblitt causal link specifies step plan achieves goal precondition step plan termination task 
task demonstrate monitor steve constructs plan performing task top task decomposition sacerdoti 
repeatedly expands complex step evolving plan subplan steve domain knowledge achieving plan fully decomposed 
steve simply execute plan rote 
monitoring student steve control prevent student deviating plan 
tutoring systems prevent student deviating tutor plan objective give student freedom 
demonstrating steve execute plan rote environment may unpredictable 
steve able adapt plan unexpected circumstances 
quickly student collaborating task real time 
steve continually re evaluates plan virtual world changes 
constructs plan task just described includes steps required necessary current state world 
continually comparing goals plan goals intermediate ones state changing world steve repeatedly identifies subset plan relevant completing task method analogous partial order planning weld 
long subset plan suffices completing task steve identify appropriate action 
approach efficient allowing steve interact student real time allows steve adapt plan unexpected events steve naturally re executes parts plan get unexpectedly undone naturally skips parts plan unnecessary goals achieved means 
key steve ability adaptively execute plans understanding causal links plan relate plan steps goals goals intermediate ones steps depend preconditions achieve 
main difference demonstration monitoring takes actions 
demonstrating steve performs action explaining doing 
monitoring student steve allows student take actions 
monitoring steve perform sensing actions plan checking light sensing actions change mental state student unobservable 
sensing action appropriate object sensed student field view steve takes action records result assumes student 
steve student interact task 
steve demonstrating task student interrupt steve ask finish task case steve shifts monitoring student 
student performing task student ask steve demonstrate step 
ask steve recommend step 
ask rationale steve recommendation ask follow questions steve subsequent answers shown 
steve provide rationale recommendations answer follow questions combining knowledge causal links plan knowledge parts plan relevant 
task complete steve answer questions rationale actions took task 
steve uses johnson system johnson maintain episodic memory actions performs situations performs answers action review questions recalling situation applying question answering ability illustrated 
steve collaborate student performing task explain knowledge task 
types interaction described previous section steve shift gracefully demonstration controls performance task monitoring student controls performance task 
decision shift control steve 
initially steve asked demonstrate monitor request come student tutoring module vet system 
subsequently student controls shifts asking questions asking take task asking steve take described section 
steve capable shifting control capable initiating shifts 
previous tutoring systems built authors include methods automatically shifting control methods incorporated steve 
steve tutor built rickel rickel students procedural tasks 
steve maintains record subtasks student taught 
steve suggest press function test button 
student 
steve action relevant want drain monitor test mode 
student 
steve goal relevant allow check alarm lights 
student

example explanations generated steve student performs task continually checks student sufficient experience perform subtask 
student taught subtask context relinquishes control student intervenes introduce subtask demonstrate student 
intervenes student mistake performs inappropriate action 
case describes student action inappropriate demonstrates appropriate action 
contrast react tutor built hill johnson hill johnson intervenes believes student impasse 
informally impasse point student failing progress mistake impede subsequent progress 
operationally react recognizes types impasse student action failed caused device operating produce error message student finished steps subtask achieving goals steps intended effect student started new subtask completing previous 
cases react explains cause problem student helps recover 
react provide criteria steve decide shift control demonstration monitoring 
steve react physical representation virtual world potentially nonverbal communication affect control task subtle ways 
gaze pointing direct student attention new danger environment 
nod approval show agreement student actions nod disapproval look student think twice 
cassell 
discuss uses gaze coordinate turn human dialogue describe implemented program analogously controlling gaze jack human 
subtle methods influencing student obtrusive current tutoring systems potential influence direction problem solving task directly stealing control student 
conversely students currently communicate steve point click interface virtual environment opens alternatives 
position sensors hands data gloves students gestures get steve attention raising hand objects virtual world pointing 
savage developed virtual environment interface humans agents allows human combine speech gestures report key advantages combination different types communication simpler mode cases mode ambiguous combination help disambiguate 
steve student field view hand positions anticipate errors recognize confusion 
contrast conventional desktop tutor gets little information student activity student commits particular action 
extra bandwidth human computer communication virtual environments works ways student computer tutor influence direction mutual task varied natural ways 
order train students team tasks extending steve operate multi agent settings 
context steve agents play roles team 
steve capabilities performing tasks designed objective mind expect relatively required changes 
steve current tutorial interactions students broadened include peer peer team interactions 
team member steve intervene student activities student explicitly asks help 
request help cause steve monitor student closely intervene freely 
ultimately working agent carry flexible interactive tutorial collaborative dialogues students
