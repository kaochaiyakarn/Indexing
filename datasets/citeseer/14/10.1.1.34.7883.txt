section introduce design rules diversity complementarity parsimony decomposition help designers users assess multiple view systems appropriate applications 
rule diversity multiple views diversity attributes models user profiles levels query textual query results case overview case graphical query results decision text multiple views presentation diverse information relating legal cases 
abstraction genres 
single view accommodates needs denominator view optimal needs 
view may create significant cognitive overhead user requiring simultaneously comprehend assimilate multitude diverse data may relevant needs 
presence diversity foremost reasons designing multiple view system 
particular multiple views useful types diversity attributes creation dates vs color histogram data items image database models logical structure vs geometric layout integrated circuit cad system user profiles preferences levels expertise roles levels abstraction detailed street map vs overview map metropolitan area genres block diagram vs pseudo code views software module example different levels abstraction increasingly detailed layers multiple views support progressive disclosure 
alternatively different data models model may appropriately represented separate visual representation

multiple views user gain different perspectives cases hand 
rule complementarity multiple views different views bring correlations disparities 
single view user may need mentally extract remember components wish compare 
maintaining switching components cognitively demanding 
just recognition easier perform recall visual comparison easier accomplish memory comparison 
multiple views leverage perceptual capabilities improve understanding relations views 
multiple views help users understand complex relationships different data sets 
particularly helpful coupling views shows hidden relations

rule decomposition partition complex data multiple views create manageable chunks provide insight interaction different dimensions 
single complex view cognitively overwhelming user 
multiple views help user divide conquer aiding memory reducing amount data need consider time 
situations user benefits viewing isolation different aspects single complex data object 
example large spreadsheet columns may contain data user easily comprehend simultaneously 
case user may gain better understanding segmenting data multiple views 
simplest case user may simply consider data set

rule parsimony multiple views minimally 
single view provides user stable context analysis multiple views incur cost context switching 
multiple views introduce additional system complexity 
accordingly designer able justify user learning costs computational display space costs additional view appealing rules diversity complementarity decomposition 
additional views demand increased cognitive attention user take valuable screen space require user learn constructs 
additional views additional complexity view introduced compelling reason reasons enumerated rules section 
views similar semantics designer consider merging view 
example authors worked system supports organization digital photos video 
includes image palette view users store temporary search results newly imported objects 
includes separate album editor view users compose collections objects 
design choice accordance rule diversity image palette album editor correspond different genres image collections temporary storage versus formal composition 
views similar semantics 
fact image palette considered temporary album 
perspective mind violates rule parsimony 
example real world examples rules inherent conflict 
resolving conflicts requires understanding user conceptual model 
situation unified genre probably easy users grasp 
careful consideration rules case leads rule parsimony taken precedence 
retrospect views merged 
rule parsimony applied coupling views

coupled interaction described model section third technique helping user understand mapping view 
systems shown figures brushing show relationships data views 
perceptual cues extremely helpful user application tempered understanding limitations subtleties 
illustrate point examples 
coupling powerful introduces complexities considered system design start 
particularly critical systems user may changes visible view coupling functions nontrivial 
example data views may nontrivial transformations resulting semantic questions objects view highlighted user brushes object view corresponding mean value 
additionally semantics decided implementers careful maintain information needed map objects views 
database visualization system displayed data tabular view graphical view derived data tabular view 
relationship objects views brushing unidirectional users 
result fundamental implementation decision proved difficult reverse derived view product rendering pipeline information needed map back tabular data thrown away early 
data sets massive allow extensional mapping intensional mappings inverted perfectly 
second important employ cues indicate presence relationships views important ensure visual interactive components interface result 
literature visual search tasks shown affects user performance expect similar deleterious effect multiple view system 
false cues may suggest false positives implied relationships fact hold views 
designer careful respect false negatives example know perceptual literature events occur milliseconds user perceives causally related 
changes propagated window take place milliseconds user may fail recognize relationship exists views 
quick updates possible due computational limitations constraints views temporarily decoupled decoupling evident user 
example system gray view temporarily decoupled 
alternatively uses small symbol indicate view date allows user trigger update demand 
rule consistency interfaces multiple views consistent states multiple views consistent 
additional complexity introduced multiple views balanced ease learning facilitated consistency 
consistent states comparisons easier 
contrast view inconsistency lead false cognitive inferences user 
addition suggesting designers follow usual recommendations consistency interfaces note specific areas multiple view systems consistent system state interface affordances 
system state encompasses data set user viewpoint 
example view shows particular region related view show region 
similarly objects highlighted view corresponding objects related view highlighted 
applications consistency may desirable user wishes different views preserve different states 
observed consistency may possible implement 
cases rule dictates decoupling clear 
consistency interface affordances multiple view systems easier easier learn 
apply rule designer partition systems views equivalence classes analyzing functionality 
designer ensure views equivalence class affordances 
example day week month views palm pilot calendar tool belong equivalence class provide similar functions albeit different levels granularity 
week month views tool small icon displayed indicate event 
week view tapping icon brings tooltip describing event 
month view icon small tap separately 
tapping region icon switches system daily view day event occurs 
unexpected context switches disconcerting user 
rule attention management perceptual techniques focus user attention right view right time 
events occur require user attention perceptual techniques direct user salient view 
user able rely system user monitor frequently means need remember context switch check views 
important challenge multiple view system ensure user attention right place right time 
requires guiding user currently important view ensuring user distracted away view 
perceptual techniques including animation sounds highlighting multiple views internet service data
