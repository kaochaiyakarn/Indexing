section technique strengthening password purpose 
assumptions assume user computer secure means communicating user direct physical access computer establish secure network connection computer 
cryptographic assumptions state informally follows 
rely function easy compute hard invert 
assume computation fast example may take just microseconds 
hand faster applying possible arguments property hold part short locally way function chapter 
additionally assume collision resistant 
functions md sha variants sch fairly properties 
solution describe technique context protecting laptop data stored laptop 
laptop access confidential files depends possession password user may type password laptop log time usual 
call password addition consider quantity called password supplement 
refer concatenation full password write concatenation 
laptop confidential files encrypted encryption key derived full password 
length fixed current technology mind envision length bits 
quantity chosen randomly 
user laptop may contribute sources entropy available 
expensive generate high quality random bits existing techniques applied trouble constructing short quantity quantity changes changes seldom initial installation 
example natural laptop pick new time user picks new laptop holds result applying full password 
write result 
quantity need kept secret 
laptop hold full password parts legitimate user full password password supplement kept secret 
user enters password laptop searches trying possible quantities length candidate quantity laptop calculates 
equals collision resistant access granted knowledge enables decryption confidential files 
user types password incorrectly match occur collision resistant access denied 
performance consequences performance acceptable password supplement substantial 
example computation takes microseconds bits long search take second average user enters correctly 
order candidates generated tried essential 
suggest trying sequential order starting random quantity starting 
random start prevents deductions timing allowing search terminate soon equals random start implies values provide user particularly bad access time security reduced user control access time picking changing access time poor 
security consequences protection provided technique determined strength full password strength password 
particular suppose attacker stolen disk laptop trying decrypt confidential file trying possible keys 
assuming keys properly derived full passwords possible keys possible values full password 
length password supplement bits search space attacker explore larger traditional password protection 
similarly suppose attacker trying learn guessing value applying comparing result stored laptop 
collision resistant match indicate attacker guessed correctly 
length password supplement bits search space attacker explore larger corresponding search space protection provided technique equivalent obtain traditional approach longer password 
short user remembers password gets protection full password 
order quantify improvement assume example password random bit quantity equivalent strength password supplement random bit quantity 
case protection goes mediocre respectable full password stronger des key des 
common computers store passwords clear store salt added purpose dictionary attacks 
main difference salt password supplement stored may public discarded kept secret 
may summarize technique follows salt password delete salt reconstruct salt brute force password checked 
ideally long prevent dictionary attack technique easily enhanced standard manner laptop store salt 
generalization partial password recovery variant technique allows user enter part case laptop search remainder searches password supplement 
search naturally take longer hours days 
delay may acceptable extreme circumstances example user accidentally forgotten remainder technique provides option remembering getting faster response remembering getting slower response 
strengthening secrets network problem suppose parties share secret wish basis confidential communication 
messages may encrypted example applying des key possibly padding truncation 
approach represented braces represent des encryption typical message 
weak careful expose line attacks 
log messages may provide attacker information confirm guess example message contains recognizable plaintext attacker sees guesses confirm guess decrypting attacker try guesses brute force detected 
share weak secret may wish strengthen secret equivalently establish new stronger shared secret 
natural approach create new secret send signed encrypted turning approach concrete protocol needs choose particular signature encryption mechanisms additional fields message 
weak naive choices result poor protocols permit line attacks 
example picture shows poor protocol new shared secret attacker may log protocol messages confirming guess kind weakness unfortunately appears current systems strong key stored encrypted user password 
sophisticated protocols bm bm impede line attacks 
protocols difficult design analyze permit line attacks pat 
solution ideas section lead simple protocol strengthening shared secret invents quantity fixed length sends 
optionally salt receives message searches laptop searches technique section 
result share longer secret may encrypting messages 
protocol represented running protocol basis exchanging longer secret standard protocol 
performance consequences main cost protocol perform exhaustive search hand protocol imposes great burden invention asymmetry useful apply judgement choosing roles protocol instantiated 
example may heavily server client abundant idle cycles vice versa 
section performance acceptable client fairly substantial example bits long 
cryptographic assumptions security consequences technique section protocol relies assumption locally way function 
assuming addition collision resistant protocol line attack roughly times expensive corresponding attack naive protocol length run protocol attacker confirm guess calculating possible values collision resistant match indicate complete collision resistance absolutely necessary protocol 
long implies parties successfully agree value may acceptable differ differ 
collision may create confusion confusion tolerated 
collision impede attack harder confirm guess related stretching secrets independently kelsey schneier wagner invented protocol similar wag 
protocol analogue password stretched repeated application function large number protocol achieves desirable properties 
interesting differences protocols 
differences stretching strengthening somewhat different assumptions properties example clear stretching requires certain assumptions iteration strengthening 
assumptions imply possible parallelize brute force attack stretched secret easy parallelize brute force attack strengthened secret 
stretching parties equal number applications strengthening parties needs apply times 
strengthening secret supplement introduces entropy 
contrast stretching repeated application function 
stretching particularly important judicious 
comparisons technique section parties strengthen secret exchanging message untrusted communication medium 
may say technique section instance technique section untrusted communication medium laptop user different times 
important difference nature section capable computing probably human users 
technique section hand laptop trusted manipulate compute short time control human user 
techniques applied combination 
example user entered computers computers may agree single exchanging values 
password strengthening compatible extension traditional password mechanisms 
increases security passwords requiring users memorize write long strings
