automatically choosing sets step choose relevant set 
repository sets grows time want system choose sets automatically improving annotation time 
choose sets similarity set posts sets repository 
intuitively appropriate set useful tokens common posts 
assume overlap posts set probably refer types entities 
example set posts cars expect set car honda toyota similar posts set hotels 
choose sets treat records set single document treat full set posts single document 
compute similarity documents 
select sets highest relative scores relevant sets 
selecting highest relative score sort similarity scores descending order 
traverse list computing percent difference current similarity score 
percent difference threshold score current set greater average similarity score sets algorithm terminates 
termination algorithm returns current set sets preceded matching sets 
algorithm traverses sets terminating sets relevant posts 
table shows algorithm 
www com assume correct sets relatively better irrelevant ones 
motivates percent difference splitting criterion relevant irrelevant sets 
just comparing actual similarity values capture better set compared 
posts threshold set repository sets ref ri ref sim ri similarity ri sim ri descending order sim ri sim ri sim ri av sim rn return sim rx return matching sets table automatically choosing set algorithm impose particular similarity measure jensen shannon distance jsd lin set set posts 
jensen shannon metric information theoretic measure quantifies difference probability distributions 
jsd requires probability distributions define distributions likelihood tokens occurring document 
points require clarification algorithm 
algorithm requires setting threshold completely automatic 
light employ machine learning learn threshold done 
simply set reasonable value mean high specific low passing 
experiments show value works domains 
employ heuristic terminating percent difference threshold score average 
sorted list similarities numbers start get small percent differences suddenly increase 
mean matching sets 
just set worse current bad 
matching posts set choose relevant sets algorithm matches post best matching members set set member schema attributes values semantic annotation 
case selecting multiple sets matching posts algorithm runs iteratively matching set posts chosen set 
chosen sets schema select ranked higher terms relevance prevent redundant matching 
match set records posts employ vector space model 
vector space model machine learning algorithm unsupervised scalable 
envision semantic annotation unstructured ungrammatical data scale world wide web characteristics necessary 
match posts records set treat post query record set document 
define similarity post set record dice similarity 
call post record set sets tokens 
dice similarity defined dice slightly change classic dice similarity treat tokens belonging intersection jaro winkler similarity greater equal 
ensures capture tokens misspelled abbreviated matches misspellings common posts 
definition dice similarity compare post pi member set return set matches maximal similarity called post store matches rmax collection matches set posts 
way compute average dice similarity scores matches algorithm 
posts scored separate true matches false positives 
major difference machine learning matching information retrieval machine learning explicitly denote non match information retrieval returns maximally similar document exists 
matching posts means false positives matched 
example post car sale cheap machine learning determine match vector space model assign member set match albeit low similarity score 
prune false positives calculate average similarity score rmax 
remove average removing matches posts pi 
final step remains semantic annotation 
possible set record maximum similarity score post set 
means problem ambiguity annotation provided set records 
example consider post civic sale look assume set records model trim year 
record honda civic dr lx record honda civic dr lx record honda civic ex 
records maximum similarity post problem ambiguous attributes 
confidently assign honda civic model year matching records agree attributes 
call attributes agreement 
disagreement trim determine value best attribute matches set values equally valid vector space perspective 
leave attribute annotation 
reasonable approach real world posts detailed attributes specific 
example post shows ford claim trim year 
final step remove attributes annotation agree matching set records 
vector space approach unsupervised annotation shown table 
posts set rmax pi max dice pi rmax rmax pi prune dice avg dice rmax remove attributes agreement table vector space approach automatic semantic annotation aspect approach requires discussion dice similarity 
past information retrieval choose dice similarity additional reasons 
choice tf idf weighting cosine similarity 
sets matching fine level individual records post weighting schemes unimportant tokens discounting important ones 
example set cars token honda occur frequently sedan 
case set record incorrectly match post simply matches sedan important token honda 
dice hand exploit frequency weights 
similarity measure jaccard similarity uses intersection tokens divided union 
jaccard penalizes having small number common tokens problem matching posts times posts contain just important tokens matching civic jaccard contains union denominator denominator affected size intersection union sum sizes sets minus intersection 
tokens common denominator shrunk resulting higher score common denominator barely affected 
dice similarity number tokens common affect denominator 
tokens common dice boosts number numerator leaving denominator 
jaccard boost numerator barely affects denominator 
tokens dice gets higher score jaccard

previously reported data testing uses posts 
believe encouraging results new approach fully automatic selection sets matching previous approach requires user provide correct set labeled training data 
interesting difference approaches disambiguating false positives leads problems vector space model 
machine learning learn directly candidate matches true matches false positives especially certain matching attributes indicative match 
example matching car model probably better indicating match matching car 
allowed sure set attributes match correct confident match problem attributes agreement 
vector space model disambiguation problem certain set records score post equally match especially notion certain attributes indicative 
clearly limitation approach requires select intersection union attributes returned set attributes 
select intersection want limit false positives attributes leads problems especially attributes short ambiguous 
example trim attribute craig list cars short pieces text usually just letters 
cases different sets letters post match multiple set correct attributes agreement get removed hindering accuracy
