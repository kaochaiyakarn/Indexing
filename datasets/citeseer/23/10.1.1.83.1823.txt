wordnet includes semantic relations synonymy wordnet basic relation wordnet uses sets synonyms synsets represent word senses 
synonymy syn name symmetric relation word forms 
antonymy opposing name symmetric semantic relation word forms especially important organizing meanings adjectives adverbs 
hyponymy sub name inverse hypernymy super name transitive relations synsets 
usually hypernym semantic relation organizes meanings nouns hierarchical structure 
meronymy part name inverse name complex semantic relations 
wordnet distinguishes component parts substantive parts member parts 
troponymy manner name verbs hyponymy nouns resulting hierarchies shallower 
entailment relations verbs coded wordnet 
semantic relations represented pointers word forms synsets 
pointers represent semantic relations wordnet words word senses 
relational theories lexical semantics hold word defined terms words related

followed relative clause meronymy semantic relations specify sugar differ kinds 
semantic relations encoded wordnet support constructions 
standard lexicographic practice definitional glosses included synsets synonyms represent sense 
interface wordnet allows user enter word form choose pull menu appropriate syntactic category

contextual representations polysemy major barrier systems accept natural language input 
example different senses english word form may translate totally different words language 
systems machine translation able determine sense author mind 
information retrieval query intended elicit material relevant sense polysemous word may elicit unwanted material relevant senses word 
example computer assisted instruction student asking meaning word meaning context list alternative senses pick 
wordnet lists alternatives choices 
wordnet useful incorporated means determining appropriate senses allowing program evaluate contexts words 
requirement goal development 
choosing alternative senses polysemous word matter distinguishing different sets linguistic contexts word form express word sense 
people quite making distinctions 
instance people told board window notice board polysemous 
sense board nail reaches conscious awareness 
people distinctions understood 
algorithm sense identification distinguish sets linguistic contexts raising question context required 
limits linguistic context defined arbitrarily prefer define terms sentences 
say words occur context occur sentence 
definition sense identification matter distinguishing sets sentential contexts 
miller charles proposed contextual representation associated sense characterizes sentential contexts word express sense 
empirical problem determine contextual representations look 
usual way computational linguists coped polysemy limit domain discourse 
example noun flight senses wordnet domain discourse limit ai commonsense problems ed air travel occur 
topical context vocabulary discuss defined topic provides information needed contextual representation 
results obtained leacock towell voorhees indicate topical context identify senses correctly time 
people local context exact sequence words immediately preceding polysemous word 
best characterize contexts associated word senses remains open question 
semantic concordances prepared provide basis empirical studies sense identification 
semantic concordance textual corpus lexicon combined substantive word text linked appropriate sense lexicon 
example words passages brown corpus linked senses wordnet providing test bed proposed sense identification systems 
semantic concordance small provide representative samples contexts indicative different senses polysemous words 
supplementing wordnet textual database remains ongoing project
