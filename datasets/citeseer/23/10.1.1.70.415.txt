learning actual practices field examined find great deal knowledge communication epistemology 
knowledge communication ability cause support acquisition knowledge restricted set communication operations 
research conducted epistemology examines effectively generate facilitate communications cause support desired acquisition knowledge 
best paradigm simplistic view learning transfer information outside inside learner head treats knowledge communication context constructivist interactional stances considered 
constructivist epistemology emphasizes agency individual learner learning process 
learning happen learner efforts making sense world mentor arrange learner challenging experiences order accelerate change process 
researchers take constructivism extreme view social interaction helpful essential 
interactional diverse include accounts emphasize individual social agency 
individual agency individual unit agent learning learning enhanced social interaction 
examples include cognitive theory socio cognitive conflict theory 
contribution theory interactional account construction common ground individual epistemology explain knowledge communication jointly constructed communication process 
boundary individual social agency find vygotsky oft cited observation developmental learning social interaction understood internalization interpersonal processes intrapersonal processes

negotiation potentials 
medium offers certain potentials action 
participants may feel obligation obtain agreement modifications shared workspaces 
potentials action offered medium guide interactions ideas associated afforded actions 
users technology medium focus particular aspects problem medium designed prompt actions require negotiation aspects 
referential resource 
jointly constructed representations meanings participants virtue having produced process negotiation 
representational constituents rich referential resource conversation facilitating elaboration previous conceptions 
vehicles communicating expert knowledge representations objects learners engage sense making conversations designed lead productive conversation
