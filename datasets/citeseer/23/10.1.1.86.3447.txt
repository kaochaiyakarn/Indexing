comparison voip case described previously malware infected point time 
growth curves show bandwidth major limiting factor quickly lifetime malware 
intuitively suspect bandwidth radio cell level presents significant hurdle 
measuring average congestion network topological hierarchy revealed rnc sgsn link primary bottleneck 
shows average congestion erlang address book topology radio cell level node rnc link rnc sgsn link 
measure average congestion summing amount bandwidth elements link dividing total amount bandwidth available 
measurement provides rough network wide gauge congestion 
large fan ratio node bs large flow traffic constantly arriving rnc 
rnc move traffic sgsn 
total traffic node bs overwhelms total bandwidth available rnc 
interestingly congestion peaks early approximately minutes 
congestion decreases slightly time phones infected 
result somewhat counter intuitive deserves explanation 
logically phones infected turn try contact phones add congestion 
defined successful connection attempt uses bandwidth 
success occurs phone able connection phone 
congestion phone busy infecting phone consume bandwidth 
noted section assume separate control signaling channel handles call setup actual payload data sent 
calls connect data bandwidth 
congestion decreases reasons 
phones attempt ing dial dial phones heavily populated congested areas 
consequently reach intended victim congestion add congestion 
dense regions congestion remains high 
sparsely populated regions congestion goes phones attempting contact victims congested areas 
result average congestion goes mix heavily lightly congested regions 
reason decline congestion increas ing number phones completed contacting entries address books begun randomly dialing 
chance reaching cell phone low randomly dialing attempts generally add congestion send malware payload 
related question soon due users experience congestion 
assume network topology carries traffic payload data reality certain operating load 
load serve limit malware potential spread quickly 
malware just starting propagate phones experience congestion unavailable service short amount time especially areas malware appears 
avg 
congestion elements time radio cell level rnc level rnc sgsn level average congestion levels network elements voip scenario 
shows percentage infected cell phones attempt denied communication due unavailable bandwidth phone trying voip service infected experience similar congestion time 
shows related measure absolute number phones denied service time 
figures illustrate sides picture 
early phones trying communicate 
ones get concentrated geography due social topology generation 
remaining phones located nearby regions denied service 
percentage phones denied service high despite relatively infected phones 
time number infections increase spreads cover wider region 
phones experiencing congestion time percentage infected phones experiencing congestion try communicate 
absolute count denied service represents smaller fraction phones attempting communication succeed located different areas 
interesting corollary finding phones heavily populated re city centers infected sooner bandwidth areas quickly exhausted 
devices operating sparsely pop regions available bandwidth infected early consequently infecting sooner
