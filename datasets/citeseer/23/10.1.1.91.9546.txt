wordnet wordnet semantic lexicon english language 
groups english words sets synonyms called synsets provides short general definitions records various semantic relations synonym sets 
purpose twofold produce combination dictionary thesaurus intuitively usable support automatic text analysis artificial intelligence applications 
database browsed online 
wordnet created maintained cognitive science laboratory princeton university direction psychology professor george miller 
database contains words organized synsets total pairs verbs adjectives adverbs 
wordnet distinguishes nouns verbs adjectives adverbs follow different grammatical rules 
synset contains group synonymous words collocations collocation sequence words go form specific meaning car pool different senses word different synsets 
meaning synsets clarified short defining glosses definitions example sentences 
example noun vacation senses 
sense word vacation synonym holiday definition leisure time away devoted rest pleasure 
second sense word vacation definition act making legally void 
synsets connected synsets number semantic relations 
relations type word include nouns hypernyms hypernym kind hyponyms hyponym kind coordinate terms coordinate term share hypernym holonym holonym part meronym meronym part verbs hypernym verb hypernym verb activity kind travel movement verb verb activity doing manner lisp talk entailment verb entailed doing doing sleeping coordinate terms verbs sharing common hypernym adjectives related nouns participle verb adverbs root adjectives semantic relations apply members synset share meaning mutually synonyms words connected words lexical relations including synonyms antonyms opposites related
