epc models essentially consist set functions events connected control flow arcs connectors 
hand epc models describe processes business perspective 
hand epc models facilitate adoption customization process oriented information systems serving staring point actual implementation 
research regarding semantics epc far mainly concentrated formal semantics available language constructs 
labels individual elements epc model considered investigations far significantly contribute epc model 
usually designer model adds labels natural language 
substantial part semantics epc model bound natural language introducing high degree ambiguity misinterpretation risk 
long model provided read individual problematic 
models different modelers united queried translated semantics contained models validated automatically leveraged configuration information system necessary clearly defined semantics model elements 
problem solved associating elements epc model concepts formal ontology referred semantic annotation 
order semantic annotation shift event driven process chains semantic event driven process chains layered approach developed authors cp

different layers ordered increasing degree abstraction underlying epc model general semantics 
owl classes owl classes instances ist ist rdf instances maier maier xml data ist ist topmost layer contains business ontology comprising relevant concepts enterprise context interrelationships owl classes properties cp 
www org owl 
ontology created merging different ontologies conforms open world assumption owl 
representation language owl dl subset owl order gain maximum expressive power retaining computational completeness 
going top bottom layer general concepts create new specialized concepts representation semantics individual business process elements distinct functions order processing events order received 
level additional information added semantic restrictions details regarding technical implementation execution processes centralized consistent manner 
concepts instantiated layer instances business process concepts produced correspond physically existing entities enterprise resources 
underlying layer instances upper layer generate semantic description business processes 
accomplished establishing graph flow instances upper layer semantic event driven process model information bottom layer concrete flow instances involved flow 
order represent model expressive power rdf sufficient 
transform epc models models epc models layer extended slightly semantic mapping information 
modeler associate instances layer epc process model layer 
technically annotation information added xml representation epc model attributes 
transformation xslt stylesheet developed consumes annotated xml model produces corresponding rdf xml representation 
storing querying generated models preliminary prototype developed institute information systems iwi uses relational database jena framework 
prototype allows querying models sparql query language conjunction inference engine 
benefits approach process models queried semantic level 
inference engines possible infer new facts contained original model 
example inventory defined physical things sold customers process consumes things inferred process reduces inventory 
advanced validation opportunities process models achieved 
validation model done restrictions established ontology layers 
possible impose policies business processes centralized way 
execution processes facilitated ontology easily extended technical information bridging gap business technical process models 
example bpel representation generated model execution information added ontology classes layer 
consequently alignment business process concepts infrastructure done centralized way redundancy 
queries possible process concepts level level instance level level allowing user potential business partner discover available process element types retrieving instance data repository 
expenditure process models reduced translation process model element labels required process element type level contrast translation individual model element labels 
research done regarding suitable ontologies tools annotation process models
