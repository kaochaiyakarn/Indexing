nile query processing engine data streams ali aref elmagarmid xiong purdue university west lafayette usa 
demonstration presents design steam purdue boiler makers stream database system allows processing continuous snap shot queries data streams 
specifically demonstration focus query processing engine nile 
nile extends query processor engine object relational database management system predator process continuous queries data streams 
nile supports extended sql operators handle sliding window execution approach restrict size stored state operators join 
specifically nile supports features efficient correct pipelined execution sliding window queries multiple data streams 
correct execution enforced novel pipelined scheduling approaches time probing approach negative tuple approach 
scalability terms number queries number data streams 
access control accept register new continuous queries new streams 
providing guarantees quality service quality answers 
online stream summary manager 
integrating online data mining tools query processing data streams 
approximate window join processing joining network data streams 

stream query processing main components nile stream query processor shown 
source streams modeled stream data type 
nile communicates source streams remote locations network sensor devices stream manager 
stream manager registers new stream access requests uses interface retrieve data registered streams 
nile uses stream scan communicate stream manager 
nile uses approaches schedule pipelined execution sliding window operators 
approach time probing uses window operators second approach negative tuple uses special operator expire emulate tuple addition supported part national science foundation iis eia iis iis eia 
proceedings th international conference data engineering icde ieee time probing negative tuple hybrid count distinct query engine nile interface minus group expire expire stream manager group expire storage manager tion window content 
addition negative tuple approach alleviates operators checking window constraint 
third approach hybrid approach uses mix approaches 
nile introduces window operators window join sliding window distinct aggregate set operations 
addition nile implements operator separate preemptive thread 
operators communicate network fifo queues 

description demo demonstration show flexibility nile system define new streaming sources execute sliding window queries 
applications real data sets include retail transactions wal mart stores video data streams spatio temporal data
