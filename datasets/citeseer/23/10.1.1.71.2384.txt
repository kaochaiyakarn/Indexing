sensor network sensor network tier contains highly resource constrained sensor actuator nodes 
functionality typically tier includes sensor sampling local data filtering aggregation tracking localization gateway range devices fulfill gateway functionality quite broad 
simple scenarios typically single device communicating base station sensor node serial communication 
complex scenarios overlay power ful mote devices intel mote multiple tiers devices capabilities gradually increase capabilities typically general purpose hardware 
gateway functionality includes providing communication general purpose devices complex multi node data aggregation fusion authorization caching back back consists various general purpose hardware platforms

functional decomposition dimension decompose middleware conceptual layers functionality similar layering middleware introduced 
categories identified technology distribution services management 
technology technology layer hides peculiarities underlying operating system hardware 
provides abstractions easier program single node 
may extend enhance functionality provided operating system facilitate development layers 
distribution distribution layer similar technology layer aims distributed programming 
provides abstractions mechanisms ease implementation distributed programs 
services local distributed abstractions middleware provides reusable services application developers 
eases development applications application developer doesn re implement recurrent functionality 
management management layer groups middleware efforts support ordinated management sensor network deployment 
includes support starting stopping services devices adding removing replacing services middleware support manual management executing triggers humans semi automated management parts automated human loop automated management policies qos requirements 
noted layering conceptual imply layered implementation 
especially sensor network tier opposite true 
scarce resources necessitate implementation strictly layered
