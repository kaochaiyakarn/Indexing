tagging systems folksonomies flickr expanding tremendously 
resources added 
resources system increase amount difficult explore resources 
purpose system org provides mechanism organize resources classifying tags keywords attached predefined categories 
supervised classification case infeasible propose new classification algorithm know require training data 
experiments downloaded images tags groups flickr website classified tags different categories 
cohen kappa measure evaluate classification results know

keywords tags classification tagging systems folksonomies semantic web cohen kappa people attracted tagging systems flickr number benefits provide 
example easy require specific skills 
users search browse resources tags keywords attached resources 
provide tag clouds browse resources 
tag cloud frequently tags displayed large text 
despite benefits difficult user browse particular types resources 
just consider scenario user wants explore vehicle images 
considering current searching browsing facilities www flickr com del icio provided systems difficult browse particular kind resources 
problem exploring resources particular type solved additional classification resources 
classifying resources predefined categories provide mechanism explore particular type resources tagging system 
improve user experience add benefit existing tagging systems 
manually classifying resources available tagging system feasible tremendous amount data added 
kind system required classify resources tagging system categories supervision 
explored means automatically organize tags hierarchies order explore resources tagging systems provide better browsing experience user 
purpose developed system org tag organizer classifies resources tagging system predefined categories helps browsing particular type resources available tagging system 
classification resources classification tags attached resources 
resource tags having different categories resource classified categories 
example resource tags paris peugeot tags classified location vehicle respectively resource placed categories location vehicle 
tag classification help user tags tagging system organized way 
example representing different tags tag cloud useful tag cloud displays tags categories user clicks tag subsequent tags displayed 
way user explore different type tags resources available tagging system possible simple tag cloud
