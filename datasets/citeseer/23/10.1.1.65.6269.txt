generative language models feedback mechanism uses document level annotations bias generation expansion terms generate browsing suggestions form concepts selected controlled vocabulary typically digital library settings 
provide detailed formalization feedback mechanism evaluate effectiveness trec genomics track test set 
retrieval effectiveness find improvement mean average precision query likelihood baseline whilst increasing precision 
base parameter estimation feedback generation algorithm large corpus find improvement state art relevance models 
browsing suggestions assessed dimensions relevancy 
account topic results helps understand type queries feedback mechanism particularly helpful 
query express information need digital library user may fail match relevant words domain explored 
query terms match terms documents domain may authors relevant articles 
authors working different areas may different terms single concept may denote different concepts term 
methods exist overcoming vocabulary mismatch problem query expansion 
query expansion adds terms possibly original query terms effectively express original information need 
automatic approaches query expansion studied extensively information retrieval ir 
operate initial set retrieved documents look additional significant terms 
dedicated kinds techniques time various methods proposed 
class solutions looks problem data driven perspective generating expansion terms entire documents document summaries context original query terms appear 
knowledge look external resources ontologies thesauri occurence tables synonym lists 
consider query expansion setting digital library information access usually mixture tasks searching browsing 
query expansion typically aimed increasing effectiveness search component interested expansion techniques help improve browsing support 
particular goal achieve effective query expansion effective state art data driven approaches time incorporates explicit knowledge inherent digital library facilitate browsing exploring 
specifically aim enhance user search facilitating kind browsing directly transparently searching process suggesting controlled vocabulary terms integrating retrieval model 
research questions address fourfold 
language modeling framework incorporate thesaurus information generating terms facilitate browsing 
second done way feedback mechanism achieves state art performance
