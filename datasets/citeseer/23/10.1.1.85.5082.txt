remaining sections part shall representations world system interacting automata explicate notions causality ability knowledge including self knowledge 
automaton representation notion system interacting discrete finite automata shown 
box represents subautomaton line represents signal 
time takes integer values dynamic behaviour automaton equations interpretation equations state automaton time determined state time signals received time value particular signal time determined state time automaton comes 
signals source automaton represent inputs outside signals destination represent outputs 
finite automata simplest examples systems interact time 
completely deterministic know initial states automata know inputs function time behaviour system completely determined equations time 
automaton representation consists regarding world system interacting subautomata 
example regard person room subautomaton environment consisting additional subautomata 
shall see representation qualitative properties interactions things persons 
take representation seriously attempt represent particular situations systems interacting automata encounter difficulties 
number states required subautomata large example try represent knowledge 
automata large represented computer programs way involve mentioning states individually 

geometric information hard represent 
consider example location multi jointed object person matter difficulty shape lump clay 

system fixed interconnections inadequate 
person may handle object room adequate automaton representation require signal lines connecting object 

serious objection terminology automaton representation epistemologically inadequate 
know person list internal states 
kind information needs expressed way 
may automaton representation concepts causes kinds counterfactual statements struck match yesterday lit elaboration representation concept believes 
consider notion 
system subautomata external inputs 
subautomata suppose signal lines coming defined terms new system sp obtained system disconnecting signal lines coming replacing external input lines system 
subautomaton output system replaced external input 
new system sp set states system condition state 
applications may condition box bananas 
shall write read subautomaton bring condition situation sequence outputs automaton sp eventually put state satisfies 
words determining achieve consider effects sequences actions quite apart conditions determine 
consider initial state subautomata initially state 
reader easily verify propositions

place suppose automaton decides reasoning example suppose computer rp 
output determined decisions reasoning process 
know computed advance appropriate considers achieved sequence outputs 
common sense reasoning operate way 
simple notion requires elaboration represent adequately commonsense notion practical purposes reasoning program 
suppose system automata admits external inputs 
ways defining case 
way assert achieve regardless signals appear external inputs 
require existence sequence outputs achieves goal regardless sequence external inputs system 
note definition requiring way knowing external inputs 
alternative definition requires outputs depend inputs equivalent saying achieve goal provided goal achieved arbitrary inputs automaton put place definitions function place subautomaton system subautomaton 
know treatments preferable shall call concept second 
idea person depends position characteristics somewhat counter intuitive 
impression mitigated follows imagine person subautomata output outer subautomaton motion joints 
break connection world point answer questions fit hole shall get counter intuitive answers run top speed hour jump building sequences motions joints achieve results 
step consider subautomaton receives nerve impulses spinal cord transmits muscles 
break input automaton shall longer say jump building run long top speed limitations muscles taken account 
shall say ride appropriate nerve signals achieve result 
notion corresponding intuitive notion largest number cases obtained hypothesizing organ decisions things transmits decisions main part brain tries carry contains knowledge particular facts 
break point shall able say dial president secret private telephone number know question asked dial particular number answer 
break give statement go saying goodbye hurt child feelings 
basis examples try postulate sequence narrower narrower notions terminating notion person 
notion superfluous 
look single best notion mentioned notions useful circumstances 
notion single sentence different levels constraint mentioned 
explicating notion automaton representation world suited defining notions causality 
may say subautomaton caused condition state changing output prevent 
fact idea system interacting automata just formalization commonsense notion causality 
automaton representation explicate certain counterfactual conditional sentences 
example sentence struck match yesterday time lit suitable automaton representation certain state system yesterday time imagine break nerves lead head output decision box appropriate signals strike match having 
definite decidable question system sp match lights depending wet interpretation kind counterfactual sentence needed rp learn mistakes accepting generating sentences form done successful alter procedures way produced correct action case 
foregoing taken representation situation system interacting subautomata granted 
situation represented system interacting subautomata number ways different representations yield different results subautomaton achieve happened subautomaton acted differently caused 
different representation corresponding subautomata identifiable 
notions depend representation chosen 
example suppose pair observe situation room 
martian analyzes collection interacting people second martian groups heads subautomaton bodies 
creature momentum space regard fourier components distribution matter separate interacting subautomata 
martian convince second representation preferred 
roughly speaking argue interaction heads bodies person closer interaction different heads analysis achieved primordial muddle conventional representation 
especially convincing points meeting heads interacting continue interact respective bodies 
express kind argument formally terms automata follows suppose autonomous automaton automaton inputs states 
integers label points array states done mn ways 
ways representation automaton system state automaton interacting state automaton corresponding row array state column state signals correspondence states subautomaton just values output states 
may happen signals equivalent effect subautomaton equivalence relation form equivalence classes signals 
may regard equivalence classes signals 
suppose signals signals ask small taken general compared answer may obtained counting number inequivalent automata states comparing number systems automata states respectively signals going respective directions 
result worth working detail tells state automata admit decomposition small compared automaton happens admit decomposition unusual admit second decomposition equivalent respect renaming states 
applying argument real world may say overwhelmingly probable customary decomposition world automaton separate people things unique objective usually preferred status 
notions causality counterfactual associated decomposition preferred status 
opinion explains difficulty philosophers analyzing counterfactuals causality 
example sentence struck match yesterday lit meaningful terms complicated model world objective preferred status 
preferred status model depends correspondence large number facts
