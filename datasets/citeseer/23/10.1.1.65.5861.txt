background world wide web internet world wide web www just web today consists large extent distributed collection hypertext markup language html pages 
www developed early european organization nuclear research cern geneva switzerland effort ease sharing information different computer systems 
basis www html meant simple format language structured information document logical components headings paragraphs links 
www huge success gained widespread focus shifted early content view concerns appearance web pages 
html version contained lot new layout features script languages java applets increased interactive capabilities visual expressiveness web 
searching web growth web amount available information large browse manually 
find information particular topic various search engines 
major problem search engines order find relevant results scan html documents find words phrases match keywords describe topic 
problem approach difficult describe topic keywords match content relevant pages particular topic matching lot unrelated pages

searching semantic web edutella edutella project example semantic web implementation 
international effort create metadata infrastructure peer peer networks rdf 
generally applicable edutella mainly initially aimed libraries universities educational institutions 
edutella project providing application programming interface api example applications act producers consumers metadata

qel stands query exchange language level 
query states give resources books

disjunctions give book searching semantic web resources books magazines impossible express separated distinct queries 
edutella query exchange language level rdf qel adds disjunctions reach level rdf qel adds negation fully expressive query language 
advanced edutella queries edutella query exchange language level rdf qel approximately equivalent prolog datalog 
rdf qel rdf qel add different levels recursion allow transitive closure 
going new rdf concepts need defined sequences reified triples 
order describe ordered sequences rdf provides special class rdf seq 
resources type properties rdf rdf ordered sequence items 
actual index sequence member doesn matter rdfs adds property rdfs member indicates unspecified sequence member 
example rdf seq shows alphabetically ordered sequence apple banana pear 
rdf type resource rdf seq rdf rdf rdf apple banana pear ordered rdf sequence 
qel need refer triples addition resources literals 
done indirectly creating resource parts triple subject predicate object 
rdf defines kind indirect resource type rdf statement indirect referencing different parts triple called reify triple 
rdf defines properties rdf statement refer different parts reified triple rdf subject rdf predicate rdf object respectively 
edutella edu class extension rdf statement class way

edutella rdf qel queries predicates rules analogous prolog programs express queries impossible manage simple free text search engines

groundwork done 
code mapping result query variables new query written part query management class library

limitations edutella query language query management system doesn require edutella system edutella biased 
possible implement capability send queries metadata systems changing existing interfaces queries sent edutella network important ones foreseeable 
edutella international open source effort powerful concept 
said edutella isn perfect development doesn claim 
serious problem occurs trying express queries type give resource satisfies condition available give metadata 
problem express edutella prolog query language want resource metadata isn 
normally want resource metadata express give resource metadata 
express query expression give resource give resource metadata 
extremely inefficient want lot metadata 
number disjunctive clauses grows exponentially number metadata properties want resource 
possible express query efficiently prolog 
needed outer join expression database languages sql 
reasonable solution extend edutella query language equivalent 
edutella queries rdfs section noted class membership sequence items specified due lack typed containers rdfs 
extending rdfs slightly topic discussing query management interesting aspect rdfs limitations 
non metadata view purpose specifying vocabulary rdfs define valid rdf constructs 
order check specific instance rdf form satisfies vocabulary specification rdf forms compare instance specification 
automated solution design query matches rdf forms 
execute query rdf database containing rdf form instance see form specified root resource 
query designed find rdf forms kind vocabulary specification rdf forms 
edutella queries complement rdfs 
addition higher expressiveness edutella queries provide possibility automating verification rdf vocabularies 
non metadata view external annotation nature rdf metadata provides ability express information resources 
obviously results possibility annotating read information

important implications freedom expression rdf semantic web 
carrying search combined rdf metadata accessible web database information collected 
metadata authentication freedom expression desirable way weighing information different rdf sources contradict 
capable reader information order form opinion necessary know information came
