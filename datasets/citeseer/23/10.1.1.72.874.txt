efficient search peer peer information retrieval semantic small world hai jin ning chen cluster grid computing lab university science technology china proposes semantic overlay small world phenomenon facilitates efficient search information retrieval unstructured systems 
semantic overlay node maintains number short range links semantically similar small collection long range links help increasing recall rate information retrieval reduce network traffic 
experimental results show model improve performance compared gnutella compared interest model similar shortcut search technique

efficient search locating appropriate peers answer specific queries information retrieval ir systems remain challenging problem 
social networks exhibit small world phenomenon people willing friends similar interests friends social connections :10.1.1.117.7097
system assume peer maintains collection documents document categorized known topics 
peer searches issuing query contains set keywords topical entry 
social networks node maintains number short range links semantically similar node small collection long range links help increasing recall ir reduce network search traffic

algorithms constructing semantic overlay construction semantic small world overlay involves major tasks setting short range links establishing long range links 
short range links 
peer joins network establishes semantic summarization pulls semantic summarizations hops neighbors chooses peers semantically similar peer formula short range links node sim pi pi hops neighbor peer long range links 
model ultra semantic peers taken long range links 
know dimensional lattice node neighbors 
faloutsos considers neighborhood dimensional sphere radius equal number hops hop plot exponent 
generalize network average degree multidimensional network determine dimension network
