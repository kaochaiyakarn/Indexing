paul buitelaar ontology learning text overview 
taxonomy currently main paradigms exploited induce taxonomies textual data 
application lexico syntactic patterns detect hyponymy relations proposed 
known patterns occur rarely corpora 
approaches relying lexico syntactic patterns reasonable precision recall low 
related approaches exploit internal structure noun phrases derive taxonomic relations classes expressed head noun phrase subclasses derived combination head modifiers 
second paradigm harris distributional hypothesis discussed context synonym extraction term clustering 
line people mainly exploited hierarchical clustering algorithms automatically derive term hierarchies text 
third paradigm stems information retrieval community relies document notion term subsumption proposed example
