ontologies increasingly common world wide web building block semantic web 
web ontologies responsible making semantics pages applications explicit allowing electronic agents process integrate resources automatically 
ability integrate different ontologies meaningfully critical assure coordinated action multi agent systems 
propose strategy tool allow totally automatic ontology alignment semantic web 
ontologies rapidly lingua franca express semantics information web 
envisioned tim lee sharing domain ontologies crafted knowledge engineers wordnet cyc web site application web ontology :10.1.1.11.6264
great number small ontological components consisting largely pointers 
predictions true number tools ontology edition visualization verification drastically growing 
existence multitude ontologies poses problem semantic interoperability 
focus ontology integration problem multi agent system perspective 
main contribution proposed strategy combine known algorithmic solutions natural language processing tree comparison ontology integration problem :10.1.1.36.2506

approaches help deal ontology integration problem proposed 
prominent ones merging alignment mapping integration 
glue system multiple learning strategies help find mappings ontologies 
provides guidance ontology merge process describing sequence steps helping identify possible inconsistencies potential problems 
ontology alignment tool automatically identifies semantically similar terms 
uses set anchors pairs terms input treats ontology directed graph 
chimaera environment provides tool merges ontologies structural relationships 
investigating terms directly related chimaera uses super subclass relationships hold concept hierarchy find possible matches

proposed strategy philosophy underlying strategy purely syntactical 
perform lexical structural comparisons order determine concepts different ontologies considered semantically compatible 
refinement approach broken successive steps illustrated 
assumption lexically equivalent terms implies semantics ontologies question domain discourse 
pairs ontologies different domains lexical equivalence provide guarantee concepts share meaning 
solve problem strategy proposes structural comparison 
concepts identified lexically equivalent structurally investigated 
making intrinsic structure ontologies hierarchy concepts connected subsumption relationships isolate compare concept sub trees 
investigation ancestors super concepts descendants subconcepts provide necessary additional information needed verify pair lexically equivalent concepts assumed semantically compatible 
please note term ontology integration abstraction encapsulates different treatments including pinto ontology integration approach
