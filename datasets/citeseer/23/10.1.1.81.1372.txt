spatial pyramid matching describe original formulation pyramid matching introduce application framework create spatial pyramid image representation 

pyramid match kernels sets vectors dimensional feature space 
darrell propose pyramid matching find approximate correspondence sets 
informally pyramid matching works placing sequence increasingly coarser grids feature space weighted sum number matches occur level resolution 
fixed resolution points said match fall cell grid matches finer resolutions weighted highly matches coarser resolutions 
specifically construct sequence grids resolutions grid level cells dimension total cells 
denote histograms res numbers points fall ith cell grid 
number matches level histogram intersection function min 
abbreviate note number matches level includes matches finer level 
number new matches level weight associated level set inversely proportional cell width level 
intuitively want penalize matches larger cells involve increasingly dissimilar features 
putting pieces get definition pyramid match kernel 
histogram intersection pyramid match kernel mercer kernels 

spatial matching scheme introduced pyramid match kernel works image representation
