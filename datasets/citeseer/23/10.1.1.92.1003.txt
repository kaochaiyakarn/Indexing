social jogging motivate people run faster farther solo jogging partners roughly physical capabilities regard speed distance emphasized participants 
addition challenge finding jogging partner desirable pace runners commented run find jogging partner 
challenge resulted people moving away training faster jogging partner 
feedback survey main challenges social jogging finding jogging partner runs pace lives nearby 
current research aiming address challenges contributing greater opportunities social jogging leveraging health benefits 

jogging geographically apart jogging distance possible solution facilitates finding social jogging partners enable people jog remote friends remote 
jogging distance jogging partners live opposite parts world share experience jogging 
meeting time separate locations long distance friends stay social jogging partners 
mobile audio support aim support social communication participants encouraging opted solution featuring audio connection 
audio interface suitable mobile outdoor environment simple lightweight allows users visually focus environment 
understand converse running surveyed run replied talk running 
finding encouraged believe supporting audio interactions beneficial vast majority social 
supporting sense presence interested experience communicate remote partner audio channel asked volunteers go running time opposite directions equipped mobile phone bluetooth headset 
intrigued vivid sense presence audio conveyed participants mentioned hearing person voice wind noise footsteps depending ground surface breathing remote 
result combination created social enjoyable experience participants reported 
knowing fast partner going important half participants 
participant kept running 
explained pride don want 
thought stopping bit today easier partner wasn didn know tell phone didn try participant suggested partner carry gps tracking device verbally tell speeds felt greatly improve experience 
adding pace awareness believe increasing sense presence person enhance experience jogging geographically distant jogging partners previous audio approach 
believe limiting interaction channel audio preferable jogging scenario refrain requiring users look displays 
think adding pace awareness beneficial increased sense presence jogging partners turn contribute motivational social effects jogging 
designed mobile audio system connects distance supporting conversations spatialized sound communicate pace awareness 
jogging distance experience latest prototype jogging distance jogging partner puts pair headphones wears remaining equipment small 
partner speed data collected position audio conversation sound plane oriented horizontally head 
speaks partner hears localized audio able detect audio coming front side person jogging faster pace slower 
similar collocated setting audio cues runners speed slow order stay partner 
discuss running routes motivate keep pace simply listen environment noises location 
differing athletic abilities experience running baseline pace variable adjusted allows runner push personal pace try run partner speed 
system allows possible running side side challenge individual pace running friends run different speeds 

technical implementation 
technical implementation jogging distance consists identical systems miniature computer bluetooth gps device wireless modem mobile phone headset 
system carried small close fitting user 
prototype currently requires equipment worn envision final product slightly bigger device worn 
mini computer connected commercial wireless broadband service covers major urban parks run 
speed time data collected gps device sent mini computer bluetooth 
computer transmits data wirelessly network server calculates speed difference adjusts gps inconsistencies 
server determines fast running relation partner 
result algorithm calculates sound position value 
talks voice picked microphone audio transmitted conventional mobile phone 
initially voip technology lag reliability insufficient purposes 
routing incoming audio remote mobile phone headphones mini computer applies spatialization algorithm sound source 
mini computer uses sound position value received server transform audio data spatial audio placing sound source imaginary plane head 
result hears partner voice coming certain direction 
sound spatialization 
bird eye view spatialized sound 
order develop jogging distance important find audio setup users clearly detect sound coming 
unfortunately visual cues difficult people differentiate front back sound sources contrast left right 
addition mobility decrease audio target accuracy percent 
fortunately target accuracy application need precise 
user needs able clearly differentiate person voice coming front back 
find solution communicating sound location mobile environment evaluated different headphones audio spatialization implementations 
small informal experiment participants recruited jog treadmill public gym listening spatially positioned audio cues various models 
shelf surround sound headphones internally designed surround sound headphones regular headphones 
spatialization implementations head related transfer functions relied solely filtering frequency 
realized jogging sound localization difficult due participant exhaustion level opted intensification approach prototype positioning remote sound imaginary axis clock clock birds eye perspective person center clock looking clock propose position sound axis 
exploits person ability easily distinguish left right audio sources simultaneously conveying experience hearing sound appearing front back 
initial experiments confirmed design greatly improved sound localization ability participants creating impression person talking front 
related investigation social factors motivating people jog exercise general described 
various devices designed audio motivate individual users jogging sport kit mp player tracks individual exercise performance stops music verbally report progress 
mobile device monitors heart rate speed 
device selects music particular tempo encourage user slow speed keep pace 
devices support motivating individual user take advantage motivational benefits jogging people 
supports physical activity awareness mobile setting authors report beneficial aspect competitive progress exchange encouragement exercise

primary focus devices everyday activity dedicated jogging session 
project combining social interaction audio interface motivate physical activity actively mobile 
system communicate pace data participants 
limitations current implementation system take account elevation data assumes run flat surface order effectively compare pace data 
ideally run amount time start simultaneously 
planning conduct comparative study measure spatial audio delivery effect perceived presence person 
furthermore interested investigating greater sense presence serve motivational tool encourage people run faster farther 
results research inform designs aim support social interactions geographically distant participants mobile setting 
participants mentioned desire music jogging 
investigating spatialized music communicate pace augmented audio communication channel 
jogging enjoyed finding right jogging partner indicated participants difficult 
jogging distance advanced mobile prototype user feedback initial study 
uses spatialized sound convey pace awareness order increase sense presence person 
jogging distance hoping enable run partners geographically distant support desire motivation keep pace resulting increased health benefit
