distinguish kinds edges indicating containment association property relationships 
containment relationship denoted composite relationship witch composite node consists component nodes parts 
property relationship denoted specifies subsidiary attribute node 
association relationship denoted structural relationship specifying university name location library title international journal computer systems science engineering volume number issn author name address article journal uri city state zip journal ref name editor title price book fig
