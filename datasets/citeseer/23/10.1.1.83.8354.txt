binary evaluation ll 
models represent different approaches evaluating credibility 
binary evaluation credibility simplest strategy evaluating computer product call binary evaluation users perceive product credible credible middle ground 
users adopt binary evaluation strategy users low interest issue low ability process information due cognitive abilities situational factors little familiarity subject matter points comparison elements lead binary evaluations 
example strategy student seeking information web history due day 
threshold evaluation credibility threshold evaluation strategy includes upper lower thresholds credibility assessments 
computer product exceeds upper threshold users deem credible falls lower threshold deemed credible 
product falls thresholds perceiver may describe product somewhat credible fairly credible propose people threshold strategy evaluating computer credibility moderate interest issue moderate ability process information due cognitive abilities situational factors partial familiarity subject matter moderate ability compare various sources example threshold evaluation strategy tourist information kiosk order find suitable restaurant dinner 
spectral evaluation credibility sophisticated difficult evaluation strategy call spectral evaluation 
model offers black white categories evaluation shade gray 
propose people spectral strategy evaluating computer credibility users high interest issue high ability process information including favorable cognitive situational factors threshold spectral evaluation high familiarity subject matter evaluation considerable opportunity compare various sources elements facilitate spectral evaluation 
example person adopting strategy individual searching solution terminal illness 
elm designing credibility people credibility evaluation models different situations threshold model flexible common 
determines model people follow 
bullet point guidelines offer adaptations elaboration likelihood model elm 
elm people process information routes central peripheral 
people opt peripheral processing route little personal involvement issue lack ability motivation process information 
contrast people process centrally high personal involvement issue able devote adequate cognitive resources 
models credibility evaluation elm design implications computer products 
example computer product intended users low involvement limited cognitive ability designers concerned credibility need focus peripheral cues attractiveness source number arguments source

new research computer credibility point defined key terms synthesized previous research proposed new frameworks computer credibility 
aim facilitate new research domain outlining perspectives chi may papers users evaluate assessing computer credibility providing set key terms researching evaluating computer credibility 
users evaluate assessing credibility 
discussed users evaluating credibility computer products general phrase describe types computer devices systems applications 
ask precisely users focusing evaluate credibility computer product existing research fully answers question offer perspectives systems perspective psychological perspective 
systems perspective credibility assessment assessing credibility hypothesize people evaluate different aspects computer product device interface functionality information 
device credibility relates physical aspect computing product 
example pocket calculator physical design density button induce perceptions credibility 
interface credibility relates display computer product interaction experience 
example interface perceived credible contradicts user expectations mental models 
functional credibility relates computer product done 
includes performing calculations services processes 
functional credibility closely related strict definition trust discussed earlier 
information credibility relates believable information computing product 
example information contradicts user views correct typographical errors reduce credibility

device interface functional information credibility credibility credibility credibility trustworthiness trustworthiness trustworthiness trustworthiness issues issues issues issues expertise expertise expertise expertise issues issues issues issues table aspects computer credibility systems perspective people research evaluate design computer products credibility mind benefit differentiating aspects computing system shown table 
example hardware designers may accept challenge making device trustworthy cell matrix 
web site evaluators target issues cells relate interface function information 
hci researchers may focus just single cell table example kim moon focus exclusively trustworthiness perceptions interfaces 
hci professionals parse different aspects computer product credibility people computers distinctions easily 
research suggests people may naturally separate credibility aspect computer product 
subsequently credibility perceptions part computer bad affect credibility perceptions entire product 
common anecdotal example consider perceptions early macintosh computer 
industrial design perceived cute correlate credibility people dismissed entire macintosh computing system 
psychological perspective credibility assessment addition systems perspective propose computer users adopt psychological perspective evaluating credibility 
example computer product provides information perceived source information 
propose psychological targets credibility assessments listed psychologically immediate screen characters screen characters part computing product immediate psychological target credibility evaluation 
computer qua computer immediate target credibility evaluation computer 
research shows people credibility assessments computers evaluations computer natural users evaluations person created computer product
