rf receiver arrhythmia algorithms implemented arrhythmia algorithm non linear transformation wave detection adaptive threshold published sun documented true detection rate 
order compensate higher sampling frequency sun el detector point detection average points power non linear transformation 
implemented alarm criteria doctor setup configuration define actual alarm limits includes arrhythmia defined variations rr intervals 
abnormal ecg activity encountered store minute transmit recordings server 
addition calculate heart rate hr variations interval averaged values maximum minimum values calculated minute

discussion ecg signal obtained differs ways standard lead recording electrodes placed close 
necessary investigate recording principle arrhythmia diagnostic purposes 
hand recordings system supposed comparable recordings loop recorder technology powerful tool arrhythmia diagnosis 
proper clinical trials clearly needed verify hypothesis reasonable assume new ecg monitoring system able reliably detect rarely occurrences cardiac correct diagnosis situations patient ability carry daily activity including physical exercise body wash normal
