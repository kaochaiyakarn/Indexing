performance algorithms shown different queries graphics top show precision vs recall figures defined graphics show average relevance different document cutoff values query query news players usa playing basketball teams catalonia example semantic retrieval algorithm outperforms keyword search kb contains instances basketball players teams match query 
keyword search recognizes document relevant contains words player usa catalonia semantic search retrieves news players teams soon name player team mentioned document 
typical results search query involves region ontology degree completeness terms instances annotations 
cases yield high precision maximum recall 
hand relevance graph shows semantic search gives high ranks relevant documents

causes precision drop lower values recall increases 
total recall semantic search low precision top ranked documents ones annotated instances kb 
documents semantic search fails high ranking combination keyword search shows comparable behavior example query news basketball players case performance algorithms similar 
example intentionally removed instances players kb leaving relatively low number 
removed lexical variants label keyword properties player instances player surname 
consequence annotations missing 
conditions semantic model performs worse keyword search 
combined search yields similar final behavior keyword search 
query news european union example shows case method fails 
kb contains instance european union possible syntactic variants spanish ue 
problem catalan sports teams word ue acronym sports union catalan names 
kb contained teams disambiguation algorithm solve problem favoring sports interpretation appropriate ue part longer matching string team name 
examples labels totally coincident system classification news instances context information disambiguation 
teams missing kb automatic annotator incorrectly annotates sports news european union concept retriever returns 
far keyword search behaves similarly 
semantic ranking places wrong documents top position keyword model rank particularly higher correct documents 
seen automatic annotator retrieval system failing absence appropriate instances needed solve ambiguities 
way reduce negative impact incorrect annotations introduce factor automatic weighting algorithm accounts proximity respective classifications documents instances 
example difficult avoid annotating european union concept news catalan teams name contains ue fact sports news properly mention eu weight annotation reduced classifications geography politics vs sports match 
testing possible improvements automatic annotation strategies planned tasks immediate 
discussion added value semantic information retrieval respect traditional retrieval envisioned approach relies additional explicit information type structure relations classification rules concepts referenced documents represented ontology kb opposed classic flat keyword indices 
semantic search introduces additional step respect classic information retrieval models simple keyword index lookup semantic search system processes semantic query kb returns set instances 
seen form query expansion set instances represent new set query terms leading higher recall values 
implicit query expansion achieved inference rules exploiting class hierarchies 
rich concept descriptions kb provide useful information disambiguating meaning documents 
summary proposal achieves improvements respect keyword search better recall querying class instances 
example querying presidents spanish government return documents mention jos luis rodr guez presidents words president spanish government documents 
better precision structured semantic queries 
structured queries allow expressing precise information needs leading accurate answers 
instance keyword system possible distinguish query usa players catalan basket teams vs catalan players usa teams possible semantic query 
better precision query weights 
variables low weights impose conditions variables really matter 
example user search news usa players catalan teams regardless news mention team nationality player 
better recall class hierarchies rules 
example query spain return results subclasses spanish locations transitivity locatedin 
better precision reducing polysemic ambiguities instance labels classifications concepts documents
