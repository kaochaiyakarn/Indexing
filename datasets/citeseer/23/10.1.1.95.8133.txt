important distinguish approach das chen seo directly judge story news bad news hopes turning profit assumption human judges deem bad news leads exploitable price increases decreases 
avoid assumptions making judgment regarding story 
interested market reaction story 
similar approach previously considered lavrenko 

experiments initial data set gathered news stories concerning stocks standard poor index leading stocks years 
stories taken significant developments corpus news msn com ticker asp removed 
advantages particular corpus include covers significant stories eliminates redundancy 
total number stories database just average stories stock 
average length story just words short focused long permit harvesting statistics 
approaches labeling story having positive negative impact stock price 
approach matched story change price relevant stock market close day preceding publication story market open day story 
example news appeared january compared price stock close january open january 
period long reflect market reaction news regardless particular hour january news public short minimize chances significant market news mask impact story 
different approach try assume time stamp story accurately reflects precise hour news public check price changes narrower time band hour 
unfortunately assumption unduly optimistic 
second approach matched story change price relevant stock market open day publication story market open day 
example news appeared january compared price stock open january open january 
approach provides reliable assessment story impact second offers exploitable story published market close day open price investor able purchase stock 
cases defined story positive stock question rose negative stock declined 
high thresholds dramatic price moves safely assumed reactions news stories mere reflections general market moves random fluctuation 
lower threshold downward moves chosen provide equal number negative examples positive examples 
approach thresholds resulted positive examples negative examples 
considered subset stories satisfied additional conditions 
base price stock 

percentage change stock price excess percentage change stories reliably linked price change stock satisfy conditions 
approximately half stories satisfied conditions 
feature set words appeared times corpus eliminating function words exception obviously relevant words 
texts quite short represented text binary vector reflecting feature story ignoring frequency 
previous pang indicated presence information superior frequency information sentiment categorization 
categorization methodology consisted selecting features highest information gain training corpus linear svm learners learn model 

results labeling approach fold cross validation experiments yielded accuracy linear svm 
training entire corpus testing corpus yielded accuracy 
learners including na bayes decision trees yielded essentially results 
boosting selection kernels svm little effect results 
addition narrower set reliable examples yielded essentially results despite fact number training examples considerably smaller 
closer analysis results offers interesting insights 
number features clear markers negative documents 
include words shortfall negative investigation 
documents words appear negative 
happy families happy stock story happy way 
markers positive stories positive stories characterized absence negative markers 
fact words corpus highest information gain negative markers 
result recall positive stories high precision lower misclassified documents negative stories fail standard markers 
trend evident regardless learner 
stories classified negative really negative hope develop strategy leverage information short investments stories 
recall labeling approach measures price moves appearance story 
invest base price basis published story involve look ahead unavailable investor possession inside information 
honest investor interested exploiting published news select investment vehicle second labeling approach reflects price moves subsequent publication story 
unfortunately fold cross validation experiments labeling approach yield modest results just probably small margin overcome cost trading 
bears called efficient markets hypothesis fama prices fully reflect available information 

main contribution short suggest new method automatically collecting labeled data sentiment analysis 
stock price movements offers large advantages hand labeled corpora 
entire procedure automatic large corpus easily generated 
second collective judgment market reliable determiner sentiment small number judges 
objective analysis maximize profit method labeling directly matches objective 
having assembled modest corpus way learn automatically characterize news stories stocks market impact moderate success 
reliably identify certain stories negative 
sophisticated features word collocation wiebe improve matters learning methods improve results significantly 
experiments leave little room optimism analysis news stories successfully investment strategy 
labeling news stories price impact period seconds minutes publication story yield promising results
