describe novel technique visualizing high dimensional data called circle segments 
technique uses colored pixel data value classified pixel value technique kei 
basic idea circle segments visualization technique data dimensions segments circle 
data consists dimensions circle partitioned segments repre senting data dimension 
inside segments data values belonging dimension arranged center cir cle outside back forth manner orthogonal line halves segment 
results show circle seg ment technique powerful visualizing large amounts data providing expressive visualizations known techniques recursive pattern technique traditional line graphs 

today problems exploratory data analysis amount data needs analyzed 
automation activities business engineering science rapidly increasing stream data usually stored large databases 
find effective ways ing databases collection data useless databases data dumps 
data exploration difficult task researchers working data mining area currently trying find possibilities useful information large databases 
known techniques visualizing large amounts data standard mapping cartesian coordinate system geometric projection techniques matrices cle parallel coordinates id ac iconic display techniques che pg hierarchical techniques dynamic techniques aws combinations 
research area resulted data analysis tion systems implement mentioned techniques 
examples include statistical data analysis packages plus trellis bcw visualization oriented systems xmdvtool ward database treeviz information visualization exploration environment aw visdb sys tem kk 
approaches proposed far number data visualized screen time quite limited range data values 
visualization techniques allow visualization larger amounts data 
basic idea pixel value techniques isto map data value colored pixel data values belonging dimensions separate portions 
general techniques pixel data value techniques allow visualize largest amounts possible current displays data values 
data value represented pixel pixels arranged screen 
previous focuses supporting data exploration analysis pro cess providing query dependent visualizations data presenting relevant data items center display kei 
propose new pixel value technique visualizing large amounts multidimensional data called cir cle segments

data consists dimensions circle partitioned representing data dimension 
data items segment arranged back forth manner called draw line orthogonal line halves border lines segment cf 

draw line starts center circle draws pixels border line segment 
draw line border lines draw line moved parallel segment halving line outside circle direc tion draw line changes 
process repeated data items dimension visualized pro cedure restarted remaining dimensions 
algorithm cf 
called border lines steps subfunction initial pixels 
function initial pixels draws pixels segment draw lines pixel border lines 
return value initial pixels number drawn 
initial pixels function necessary especially data sets dimensions partof algorithm assumes pixels subsequent draw lines 
function draw line compute point implemented variant algorithm avoid float operations moves ahead draw line 
func tion point lines checks point segment 
point segment draw line pixel outside parallel segment having line 
new draw line draws pixels opposite previous draw line 
note circle segments technique requires data set consists dimensions additional feature circle segments technique assignment dimensions segments circle user 
experience shows possibility important changing order user compare related dimensions group relevant dimensions analysis 

comparing circle segment technique techniques tested circle segments technique compared value techniques traditional line graphs 
data base experiments stock exchange database con taining years stock data data records frankfurt stock exchange 
comparison line graph visualization stock price developments 
example visualization cf 
different colors assigned lines corresponding stock prices 
width screen technique limited represent records means example database entry 
information user able derive line graph visualization depends degree overlap 
inthe example user able see stock price development high fluctuation largely differs fromthe 
easily perceivable right half time period stock prices peaks 
circle segments technique data set cf 
oldest data items dimensions middle circle ones outside coloring maps high data values light colors low data values dark colors user gets view rep resented data set 
comparison line graph visualization circle segments technique shows better fifth sixth seventh stock highest price right visualized time period 
addition technique able easily follow development stock prices find analogical tendencies dimensions detectable line graph visualization 
example second stock show similar development fifth sixth stock progress similarly half time period third forth stock high time price third stock remaining high bit longer 
shows technique stock prices frank stock index representing data values 
high degree overlap line graphs suitable dimensions compared circle segments technique pixel value spiral kei recursive pattern techniques 
main advantage new technique representation data set better perceivable including potential dependencies analogies dimensions 
experience working visdb system implements different pixel circle segments technique technique best suited exploratory data analysis high space

introduced circle segments approach visualizing large amounts data 
technique user may generate visualizations amounts multidimensional data providing overview data 
experiments show circle seg ment technique powerful visualizing large amounts data provides expressive visualizations value techniques 
advantage technique allows user control arrangement dimensions important especially comparing multiple dimensions
