information flow doap store believe approach shows semantic web offer data providers users org net project maintainers just provide single project description creating machine readable format doap understood different tools doap store generic rdf browser keep control project information don need publish various places control data anymore users get immediate benefit updated description immediately seen previously mentioned tools 
doap store written php quite small application line code including html templates 
reasons helped realize quickly deal data discovery managed previous steps application chain introduced semantic radar 
needs lines python code integrate update data local database 
interface offers various ways query browse documents basic search engine allow retrieve projects name doap name description doap description doap hostname uri rdf graph corresponding doap project programming languages 
tags retrieved doap files doap programming language property solve case variations provide case insensitive command line 
doap store queried simple queries doap name rdf web browsers search engines tools sparql

true data record soon data created blog engine adds list pinging services 
currently documents indexed 
detailed evaluation different types data collected ping semantic web outside scope planned 
related wiki pages tools collect number uris rdf documents 
approach works org march org topic small list documents person adding 
disadvantages lists usually maintained requires user intervention result loose quality time feasible manually add uris semantic web documents created fast pace blog data export rdf 
swoogle search engines semantic web 
swoogle currently contains information rdf documents find ontologies semantic web documents 
crawls indexes different types web documents xhtml atom converts rdf provides user interface help locate navigate information 
may provide apis access information indexed main services people web interface query data 
browser extension allows collect rdf data distributed fashion 
harvest early system gather information diverse repositories build search replicate indexes cache objects retrieved internet 
architecture aim replace semantic web search engines concentrates task discover rdf documents web supply applications high quality list semantic web documents 
main retrieve lists rdf documents machine readable form api provided 
important difference existing large number users participate collaborative discovery resources web browser plugin step larger architecture 
described architecture involving user participation order discover semantic web documents simply browsing web creating todate database rdf documents search engines semantic web applications provide search user friendly services information 
shown combination simple scripts facilitate discovery distributed semantic web data 
benefits number independent applications acting application particular task new applications added pipeline open data formats 
user applications doap store database rdf documents provided build user friendly applications 
bridging gap creators semantic web data applications expect architecture provide incentives create data better applications making web data reality 
principles web tools interfaces driven users framework realizes providing methods allow part semantic web initiative 
important difference blog ping aggregators collaborative discovery involves relies user participation architecture participation web terms 
architecture hope see user activity lead enrichment semantic web interfaces distributed data 
regarding architecture main aspects 
try improve tools architecture 
example versions semantic radar able users define services want send pings way users create pinging service specific actions receive new ping 
improved possibly including news types data sources sparql endpoints metadata embedded webpages 
hope third party services deployed doap store 
various search engines front ends created search engine released soon 
performance issue growing number pings scalability challenge 
plan address distributing number servers required 
second part consist detailed analysis data collected
