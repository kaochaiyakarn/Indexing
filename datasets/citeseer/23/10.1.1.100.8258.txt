overview modern gnutella gnutella widely regarded fully decentralized peer peer file sharing system 
evolved considerably initial release early grown dramatically size especially year 
today gnutella largest networks operation 
similar unstructured networks gnutella peer joins network establishing tcp connections existing peers system 
original gnutella protocol participating peers form unstructured overlay topology peer perform flood searches peers 
improve scalability original protocol modern gnutella clients adopt tier overlay structure dynamic query distribution mechanism 
aspects gnutella pertinent study 
goals examine correlations distribution shared files location overlay topology general understanding gnutella structure required 
second gnutella browse host extension acquire list files shared peer 
subsections elaborate issues 
tier topology shown modern gnutella clients implement tiered overlay structure dividing peers groups ultrapeers super peers leaf peers 
ultrapeer neighbors ultrapeers form top level overlay 
majority peers leaves connected overlay ultrapeers 
high bandwidth leaf peers ultrapeers demand order maintain proper leaf ratio 
peers implement ultrapeer feature reside top level overlay accept leaves 
refer peers legacy peers 
leaf connects ultrapeer uploads set hashes filename keywords ultrapeer 
allows ultrapeer forward messages leaves top level overlay gnutella topology legacy peer ultra peer leaf peer 
tier topology modern gnutella matching files 
leaf peers forward messages 
approach reduces number messages forwarded leaf peers turn increases scalability network constant factor 
browse host extension important reason choose modern gnutella file characterization gnutella suite open moderately documented protocols 
browse host extension extension gnutella protocol enables peer view list files shared called sharing list peer 
feature allows users similar interests learn new material may appeal 
browse host supported major gnutella implementations limewire 
implementations combined compose roughly gnutella ultrapeers giving reasonable expectation browse host capturing files shared peers gnutella 

measurement methodology goal capture snapshot gnutella network point time contains participating peers pair wise connectivity overlay snapshot ii available files participating peer overlay file snapshot 
essence need capture snapshots overlay topology annotate peer available files 
common approach capture snapshot crawler 
set initial peers crawler contacts individual peers capture available files collect information neighboring peers session 
crawler progressively learns peers session contacts new peers available 
large size dynamic nature participating peers churn coupled slow speed crawlers practice captured snapshots crawler inherently distorted 
specifically crawler explores overlay peers join leave system results changes overlay topology possibly changes set available files system 
captured snapshot contains group peers departed arrived crawl 
problem aggravated large overlays sufficiently large number new peers may significantly increase duration crawl inflate population peers snapshot previous studies implicitly addressed problem adopting sampling schemes capture partial snapshot system partial snapshot short crawl studies periodically capture small subset participating peers partial snapshot short crawl assume captured peers properly represent entire population 
ii periodic probe fixed group studies identify subset participating peers partial crawl passive monitoring periodically probe group peers collect information available files :10.1.1.11.4677
absence solid understanding file characteristics systems clear sampling strategies capture representative population peers 
developed measurement methodology capture representative snapshot gnutella network 
goal capture entire population participating peers gnutella network complete snapshot short period minimize potential bias characterization 
note time required obtain list available files individual peers significantly longer obtaining neighbor information 
example time obtain list neighbor peers peer may take second list available files may take minutes download 
nutshell topology crawl significantly faster content crawl 
decouple topology content crawls improve accuracy captured snapshots conduct snapshots steps follows conduct topology crawl quickly capture participating peers pair wise connectivity extreme case crawler may terminate new peers contact 
crawl date type number tcp refused timeout conn lost app 
refused ultrapeers jun leaf peers total peers ultrapeers aug leaf peers total ultrapeers oct leaf peers total table 
statistics sample snapshots capturing overlay topology 
second conduct content crawl collect list files available peers identified topology crawl 
third content crawl completed conduct topology crawl order identify long lived peers initial snapshots remained system entire content crawl 
approach creates snapshot overlay topology node annotated available file label determines long short lived 
captured peers topology crawl depart system content crawl collected content measurement slightly biased peers longer uptime 
cruiser parallel crawler capture accurate snapshots systems developed parallel crawler called cruiser crawl overlay orders magnitude faster previous crawler 
cruiser achieves goal significantly increasing degree concurrency crawling process 
cruiser adopts master slave architecture slave crawls hundreds peers simultaneously master coordinates multiple slaves 
architecture allows run cruiser multiple located distributed boxes increase crawling speed 
shelf ghz gnu linux boxes lab cruiser perform topology crawl gnutella peers minutes perform content crawl hours capturing annotated snapshot takes hours min hr min 
content crawl cruiser collects file name content hash sha shared file reachable peer generates gb log file 
dataset captured snapshots gnutella network annotated list files available peer measurement periods 
period consists daily snapshots consecutive days intervals snapshots enable examine characteristics available files system short long timescales days months 
table summarizes statistics sample snapshots 
shown table divide captured peers groups ultrapeers leaf peers 
legacy peers constitute negligible portion captured peers snapshots omitted 
subset peers group unreachable crawlers reasons firewall nat blocking incoming traffic ii severe network congestion overloaded processor peer iii peer departed iv peer support browse host protocol 
ultrapeers allowed reported connection error ultrapeers indicates contacted peer departed 
connection errors leaf peers occur due peer departure firewall earlier study gnutella showed half leaf peers leave overlay hour period 
independent online statistics report leaves gnutella network 
evidences support accuracy high ratio connection errors experienced leaf peers column labeled tcp refused 
summary captured snapshots complete directly contact peers snapshot half peers obtain list available files primarily due reasons ratio departed peers long content crawl ii large number leaf peers firewalls 
briefly discuss interesting problems experienced data collection data processing 
low bandwidth tcp connection cruiser timeout mechanism closes idle connections missing snapshots due mixture software network power failures 
aware reliable technique distinguish scenarios 
seconds noticed crawls complete crawling queue empty 
examinations revealed peers crawl send data extremely low rate bytes second prevents cruiser closing connections 
instructed cruiser terminate crawl minutes crawling queue empty 
negligible number misbehaved peers affect analysis 
file identity content hash file returned target peer uniquely identify individual files 
initial measurements observed files name different content hashes setup exe login bmp 
illustrates trimmed complete file name previous studies reliable file identifier :10.1.1.11.4677
discovered files content hash value snapshot eliminated analysis 
post processing compute popularity individual files system needed keep track distinct files system resulted memory bottlenecks analysis 
leveraged skewed distribution popularity address problem follows divide captured peers snapshot segments segment contains random portion peers 
calculated popularity files segment trimmed files copies segment combined trimmed segments single snapshot 
approximation eliminated distinct files prevented memory bottlenecks postprocessing 
prevented performing analysis popular files copies entire network affect conducted analysis popular files
