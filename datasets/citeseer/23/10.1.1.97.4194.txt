tagging allows ranking data organization directly utilize inputs users enabling machine processing web content 
tags created individual users free form important problem facing tagging identify appropriate tags eliminating noise spam 
purpose define set general criteria tagging system 
criteria include high coverage multiple facets ensure recall effort reduce cost involved browsing high popularity ensure tag quality 
propose collaborative tag suggestion algorithm criteria spot high quality tags 
proposed algorithm employs goodness measure tags derived collective user authorities combat spam 
goodness measure iteratively adjusted reward penalty algorithm incorporates sources tags content auto generated tags 
experiments web show algorithm effective 
keywords classification tagging information retrieval collaborative filtering web 
effectively organizing information world wide web challenging problem 
early days internet portal services organized web content hierarchical directories assuming web organized strict structures topics 
manually supervised directories gradually crawler search engines reasons data explosion unstructured nature web content 
search engines users access web information issuing ad hoc queries limited semantic information web content parsing content exploiting hyperlink structure established web masters 
pull model search engines hard discover new dynamic content 
deep web times larger surface web 
addition personalization spam detection require human inputs 
furthermore difficult people share massive unstructured web pages recover 
push model directly takes inputs users solves problems 
tagging process users assign labels form keywords web objects purpose share discover recover 
discovery enables users find new content interest shared users 
recovery enables user recall content discovered 
tagging allows ranking data organization utilize metadata individual users directly 
brings benefits semantic web current html dominated web 
witnessing increasing number tagging services web flickr web shadows 
flickr enables users tag photos share 
users tag urls share bookmarks public 
web provides web scale social search engine enable users find share expand human knowledge 
allows users save tag web pages easily browse search content 
enables users share web pages personalized community public setting access privileges 
web provides scoped search user trusted social networks friends friends friends 
consequently search results personalized spam filtered trusted networks 
tagging advocates grass root approach form socalled folksonomy hierarchical exclusive 
tagging user enter labels free form tag object relieves users burden fitting objects universal ontology 
user certain tag combination express interest objects tagged users tags renewable energy objects tagged keywords renewable energy 
ontology works corpus small constrained domain objects categorized stable users experts 
universal ontology difficult expensive construct maintain involve hundreds millions users diverse background 
organize web objects ontology faces hard problems physical objects digital content seldom semantically pure fit specific category difficult predict paths user explore discover digital object

tagging bridges gap browsing search 
browsing enumerates objects finds desirable exerting recognition aspect human brain search uses association directly interested objects mentally 
benefits tagging come cost 
instance number tags social network multiples 
structure traditional hierarchy disappears tagging relates faceted classification uses clearly defined mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive aspects describe objects 
instance music piece identified facets artist album genre composer 
faceted systems fail dictate linear order experience facets step crucial guiding users explore system 
tags created users free form chaotic compared faceted system constructed experts 
lack order depth result disaster leaving users
