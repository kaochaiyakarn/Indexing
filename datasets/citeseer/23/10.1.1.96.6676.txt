ontology service expose shared ontologies defined web ontology languages 
typically ontology specified domain expert charge publishing revision extension ontology 

semantic registration service maintains semantic mapping information 
typically database providers define mappings relational schema domain ontology submit registration entry service 

semantic query service process sparql semantic queries 
firstly gets mapping information semantic registration service 
afterward translates semantic queries set sql queries dispatch specific databases 
results sql queries merged transformed back semantically enriched format

semantic mediation semantic view view mapping system databases mediated related shared ontology relational table mapped classes

visualized semantic mapping tool semantic web relational databases fig 

visualized semantic mapping tool task defining semantic mappings relational schema ontologies burdensome erroneous 
develop tools automate process fully automated requires humans involvement especially integration databases different schema structures

panel displays relational schemas panel displays shared ontology 
mapping panel visually displays mappings relational schemas ontologies 
typically user drag tables columns panel drag classes properties panel drop mapping panel establish mappings 
simple drag drop operations users easily specify classes mapped table property mapped table column 
operations tool automatically generates registration entry submit semantic registration service

semantic navigation query results 
tcm semantic portals semantic web relational databases semantic mediator designed separate data providers data consumers need interact semantic layer 
example developers write applications shared ontology need knowledge databases 
system offer different kinds user interfaces support query search services 
dynamic semantic query interface form query interface intended facilitate users constructing semantic queries 
query form automatically generated class definitions 
design provides extensibility system ontology updated changes database schema interface dynamically adapt updated shared ontology 
fig 
shows situation tcm user constructs semantic query 
starting ontology view panel left user browse ontology tree select classes interest 
query form corresponding property definitions selected class automatically generated displayed middle 
user check select properties interests input query constraints text boxes 
accordingly sparql query constructed submit semantic query service query rewritten set sql queries mapping views contained semantic registration service 
query rewriting somewhat complicated process gives detailed rewriting algorithm 
addition user define complex queries 
example depicted lower middle part fig 
user follow links leading related classes current class select properties input new query constraints 
fig 
shows situation tcm user navigating query results 
starting selecting result highlighted user find related data entries semantic links 
please note example relations search results discovered semantic links derived semantic layer 
intuitive search interface concepts ranking semantic navigation semantic query interface google search interface just accepts keywords complete full text search databases 
fig 
shows situation tcm user performs search operations 
starting inputting keyword user retrieve data entries containing hits keyword 
similar case query interface user semantically navigate search results semantic links listed entries 
search system generates list suggested concepts displayed right part portal 
ranked relevance keywords 
concept links lead users dynamic query interface introduced previous section 
users specify semantic query get accurate appropriate information 
call intuitive search generate list concept suggestions help user improve search results

general users reacted positively entire semantic web approach system 
indicated system provided amazing solution semantic heterogeneity problem troubling long time 
particular gave high praise visualized semantic registration tool indicated features semantic registration new database considerably save lot time new database developed needed integrated 
gave positive comments semantic portals especially semantic navigation functionality 
indicated semantic interconnections semantic web relational databases different databases wanted 
users prefer google search semantic query interface 
complained learning cycle semantic query interface long return accurate results
