flink uses different types knowledge sources html pages web foaf profiles semantic web public collections emails bibliographic data 
information different sources collected different ways knowledge learned represented ontology see section 
ontology includes foaf minimal extensions required represent additional information 
web mining component flink employs occurrence analysis technique applied social network extraction kautz 
set names input component system uses search engine google obtain hit counts individual names cooccurrences 
term semantic web ontology added query disambiguation 
strength association individuals calculated normalizing separately page counts individuals 
resulting value non negative real number power law distribution 
consider value evidence directed tie reaches certain predefined threshold hit counts individuals certain minimum order ensure support occurrence high 
web mining component performs additional task finding topic interests associating researchers certain areas research 
set names list interests kind domain concept system calculates called google researcher determine person associated certain interest 
google person respect interest simply number pages names interest person occur divided total number pages person 
note factor page count interests interested expertise individual relative 
resulting measure zero positive real term power law distribution 
assign expertise individual logarithm value standard deviation higher mean logarithmic values 
note rule thumb network analysis practice 
foaf profiles gathered semantic web steps 
rdf crawler called started collect profiles foaf web 
works similar html crawler traverses distributed network links rdfs seealso properties document 
focused collects potentially relevant statements triples predicate rdf rdf foaf namespace 
mechanism avoid large foaf producers provide relevant data particular blog sites 
overwhelming presence sites foaf characterization difficult see 
discards documents simply large contain personal profile 
restrictions necessary limit amount data collected easily reach millions triples running hour 
second step foaf individuals collection matched profiles members target community filter relevant profiles collection 
see section 
information emails processed steps 
case step requires emails downloaded pop imap store relevant header information captured rdf format foaf representing information senders receivers emails normalizing hit count interests measure assign relatively high score overly large number interests individuals pages web 
normalize page count person involved compare association strength interests 
necessary purposes 
particular name appears header email address 
second step 
lastly bibliographic information collected single step querying google scholar names individuals plus disambiguation term 
results learn title locations publications year publication number citations available 
knowledge represented swrc ontology format citation counts expressed 
alternative source bibliographic information previous versions system bibster peer topeer network metadata exported directly swrc ontology format 
representation inference storage middle layer system primary role storing enhancing metadata reasoning 
network ties interest associations metadata represented rdf terms foaf vocabulary foaf knows relationships foaf topic interest research interests 
foaf native format profiles collected semantic web 
reification extension foaf model necessary represent association weights 
detailed treatment current issues social ontology refer reader 
extensions foaf model necessary record provenance statements collected 
currently expressed rdf reification mechanism significantly adds amount data needs handled 
hope storage facility provide native features context support improve efficiency storing querying information 
support necessary implement efficient updates information 
aggregated collection rdf data stored sesame server 
information sesame rdf storage query facility refer 
note model compatible extension foaf knowledge processed point foaf compatible note possible find authors google scholar suppresses full list authors cases list long 
fortunately necessary list authors known advance 
provenance system consists source statement time collected 
scenarios add date tool 
example generic component incorporated finding geographical locations latitude longitude coordinates place names foaf profiles 
component invokes place finder sample web service provides geographic locations place names worldwide 
web service invocation facilitated apache web service invocation framework uses wsdl profile web service generate code required interact service 
storage inference major task middle layer 
sesame applies rdf closure rules data upload time 
feature extended defining domain specific inference rules sesame custom rule language 
note barring standard rule language semantic web remains practical alternative 
facility express mappings metaknowledge example authors publications senders receivers emails know foaf sense 
flink rule language carrying identity reasoning known 
identity reasoning required determine identity instances case individuals multiple information sources 
methods flink name matching object identification inverse functional properties foaf 
ifp matching directly axiomatized rule language 
foaf person class include mailbox mailbox checksum homepage properties 
example find instance instance foaf person class value foaf mbox property conclude owl name matching implemented code similarity names strings 
differences names disallowed 
matches match recorded owl property 
merging profile information semantics owl relation 
sesame built support owl equivalence axiomatize owl property rule language 
rule expansion equivalence disadvantage requires storage information equivalent instances 
principle repository cleaned removing equivalent instances 
size repository moderate due filtering irrelevant person instances removal statements require significant additional processing 
scalability perspective glad note sesame server offers high performance storing data scale millions triples especially native repositories 
native storage refers file system www com software back opposed repositories built top relational databases 
speed upload particularly important rdf crawler high throughput 
unfortunately speed upload drops significantly custom rules need evaluated 
speed uploads important keep components producing data time required resolving queries determines responsiveness user interface 
moment query optimization significant challenge server 
cases developer improve performance query rewriting manually reordering terms breaking query 
trade executing small queries versus executing single large query requires careful judgement developer 
trade terms memory footprint vs communication overhead small targeted queries inefficient due communication parsing involved large queries produce large result sets need processed client side 
browsing visualization user interface flink pure java web application model view controller mvc paradigm 
key idea mvc pattern separation concerns components responsible data model application logic controller web interface view 
apache framework flink helps programmers writing web applications respect mvc pattern providing application components logic pattern 
role programmer extend skeletal application domain task specific objects 
model objects flink graph model jung programming toolkit 
jung java library api provides object oriented representation networks implementations important measures algorithms social network analysis 
model objects loosely map underlying ontology retrieve data dynamically rdf store needed presentation 
network commonly accessed objects cached improve performance 
view layer servlets pages jsp java standard tag library generate front hides code designer front 
means design jung sourceforge net danger close mapping ontology run time model application needs rewritten underlying ontology changes 
web interface may easily changed affecting application vice versa
