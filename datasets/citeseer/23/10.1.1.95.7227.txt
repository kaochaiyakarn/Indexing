note flow unidirectional tuple specifying direction flow packets 
flows widely providing convenient way summarise large volumes internet traffic data 
ietf architecture provided general definition traffic flow 
flows bidirectional set packet attribute values allowed specify flow 
example flow simple flow complex flows network netramet traffic measuring system implements extended version flows 
streams introduced netramet way collecting data subsets flow 
example specify flow packets particular web server netramet recognise stream tcp connection server build distributions sizes lifetimes netramet ability handle streams real time allows produce stream density distributions lifetime size bytes packets long periods time hours maintaining stream lifetime resolution microseconds 
furthermore netramet collect distributions minute intervals days needing collect store process huge packet trace files 
streams bidirectional means netramet maintains sets counters direction stream 
meter see direction stream set counters remain zero 
bidirectional streams particularly useful security analysis need know attack streams elicited responses network 
streams netramet earlier study stream lifetimes know high proportion traffic bytes carried streams 
modified netramet meter fact cache flow matches stream 
meter maintains table active streams new stream appears matched determine flow counted 
set matching flows cached stream table packets counted proper flows requiring matching find rulesets average cache hit rates usually 
netramet stream caching straightforward collect distributions byte packet stream density set bins build histograms range stream lifetimes 
bins produce distributions lifetimes log scale ms minutes read distributions minutes 
streams counted time longer running streams contribute distributions directly 
create flows produce flow records giving number packets bytes time meter read 
minute flow records construct decades logarithmic bins producing lifetime distributions ms seconds roughly hours nearly decades
