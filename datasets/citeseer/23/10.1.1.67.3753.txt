discussion section focuses content systems kind system vulnerable security problems 
key aspects security defined example scenario alice sends message publish subscribe system bob authentication bob wants sure alice sent message confidentiality alice wants ensure bob read message integrity alice wants ensure bob receives message exactly message sent accountability bob wants prove alice sent message authentication establishes identity originator action 
case example bob wants ensure alice sender message 
content systems allow anonymous subscribers implying content authenticated sender 
public key infrastructure pki overhead authenticating message high 
confidentiality ability keep accessing messages 
traditional situation alice wants bob read message 
publish subscribe systems different parties involved subscriber publisher servers needed route message content 
complete confidentiality difficult obtain 
promising technique problem may computing encrypted data 
integrity requirement keeping message original form 
instance ensuring message bob received identical alice sent 
normally cryptography maintain integrity information 
publish subscribe systems different integrity problems information integrity subscription integrity service integrity 
accountability easily satisfied explicit addresses known 
example bob alice know alice easily prove bob got message 
direct relationship publisher subscriber exists publish subscribe systems impossible publisher know subscribers receive message 
solution accountability problem publishers sell keys subscribers keys subscribers decrypt selected data 
alternative ensure credibility publish subscribe infrastructure
