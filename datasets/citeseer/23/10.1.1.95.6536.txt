today web search engines fail satisfy needs users part search engines respond vague queries users 
potentially promising solution involves context search process means elaborating vague queries 
describe evaluate novel approach context web search adapts generic search engine needs specialist community users 
collaborative search method enjoys significant performance benefits avoids privacy security concerns commonly associated related personalization research 
information overload problem continues frustrate web users find increasingly difficult locate right information right time today modern search engines 
factors responsible certainly sheer quantity information growth rate tax advanced search engines 
example various estimates indicate largest search engines cover fraction available information space 
search engine coverage issue just part problem relieved meta search methods 
pressing issue degree pages covered accurately ranked relative query 
particular search engines properly formulated queries come short average web user query contains query terms 
outcome long lists apparently relevant results genuinely useful results target user far 
furthermore problems exacerbated new generation mobile internet devices 
wap support informatics research initiative enterprise ireland gratefully acknowledged phones pdas restricted input capabilities limited screen mean mobile users provide formulated queries tolerate long result lists 
generally speaking advances focused ways handle vague queries improving existing page analysis indexing ranking methods 
vagueness remains significant problem query include terms identify primary information target exclude terms usefully describe search context 
example simple query jaguar indicate user interested cars cats queries michael jordan distinguish basketball star berkeley professor appointed chairperson computer services giant eds 
researchers focused ways exploit context web search explicitly establishing search context front implicitly inferring context part search process see

section discuss results preliminary live user trial collaborative search technique enjoy improved result accuracy 
background importance context understood web search context information come 
basic options explicitly provided user search engine implicitly inferred local search environment see comprehensive review context web search 
explicit context manipulation ways capture explicit context interesting ai viewpoint outlined completeness 
option asks users provide context terms part search query 
example inquirus supplements traditional keyword query context category users select set categories research homepage meta search engine uses context categories select search engines satisfy user query 
category query modification 
query research papers web search modified include terms 
related techniques automatically learning high quality query modifications capable improving search precision reasonable levels recall 
second option introducing context web search specialised search engine index designed cover restricted information domain 
www com www mp com www ireland com essentially fixing context prior searching 
specialised search engines automatically maintain indexes information extraction techniques locate index relevant content see 
examples include citeseer searching scientific literature conference workshop information 
example citeseer crawls web looking scientific articles variety document formats html pdf postscript builds index suited literature searching 
implicit context inference establishing search context asking users provide context terms fixing context specialised search engine clearly complete solution context problem 
willingness specialised search engines specialised searches users fundamentally lazy having include additional context terms part query 
context automatically inferred 
question answered wide range research focusing different techniques capturing different types context 
fact basic approaches popular depending external local context sources exploited 
external context sources 
users rarely perform searches isolation 
search related task currently performing 
reading web page replying email writing document need search associated piece information 
advantage user activity immediately prior search may possible determine suitable search context 
goal systems watson remembrance agent letizia 
watson remembrance agent provide just time information access deriving context everyday application usage

discussion concluding discuss applications collaborative search including ability guide query elaboration page similarity predictions multimedia retrieval domains 
highlight important issues addressed applicability guaranteed domains 
query elaboration page similarities spy hit matrix estimate query term similarities page similarities query page relevance 
example correlation hit matrix rows corresponding queries qx qy measure relationship relevancy different pages selected queries 
strong positive correlation means pages tend judged similarly queries 
indicates potential relationship qx qy 
qx qy strong correlation proper subset qx relevant pages relevant qy qx general query qy 
type information valuable source knowledge query modification techniques add related query terms specialised generalised help cope vague specified queries 
similarly column correlations compute result similarities way automatically suggesting related pages user may direct similarity terms term overlap specified query terms pages selected base level search engines 
multimedia content spy collaborative ranking query elaboration result similarity strategies pay significant dividends domains traditional indexes difficult expensive compile 
example indexing non textual content music graphics expensive lack automatic indexing techniques 
consider mp search engine preliminary index individual mp files manually indexed basic genre categories additional information artist album name title words extracted heuristic methods 
furthermore assume dion song heart go theme hit movie titanic contain titanic default index term searches term fail retrieve result 
example google retrieving songs title expect song titles usually relatively unique fails perform specific queries submitted instance song returned top results query titanic 
occasionally user add dion failed titanic query get result 
select spy log hit table query terms result spy potential suggest result lone titanic query 
advantage occasional query correlations spy effectively enhance coverage precision recall underlying search engine irrespective content type index completeness 
cold start problem relevancy biases number important problems collaborative search need addressed order guarantee full applicability broad range search tasks 
important problem called cold start problem refers fact newly indexed web pages find difficult attract user attention default low relevancy score spy metric appear far result lists limiting ability attract hits may deserve query 
essentially built bias older pages 
number ways problem dealt 
look ways normalise relevancy pages respect age 
example measure age page time number queries hit amplify relevancy young pages relative older pages 
side problem 
just new pages find difficult attract hits older pages may find easy attract hits 
worst case scenario bias spy result lists pages date relevant current users past users 
biasing relevance new pages help cope problem 
course general factors probably taken account ranking search results 
focused primarily spy relevancy factor factors age page meta search ranking appropriate 
part explore best combine factors produce optimal result rankings 
may may involve direct combination rankings 
example option search results single list results normally case lists results order emphasise different qualities returned pages 
instance general subset search results non zero spy relevance scores subset selected past current query practical spy results relevancy scores special recommendations ranked relevancy presenting remaining results separately ranked meta score 
turn third list new pages ranked meta search score relevancy separately 
improving accuracy web search engines introducing context search process important challenging research problem 
described spy system attempts discover patterns activity community searchers order determine general search context prioritise search results accordingly 
spy collaboration underlying search engines builds relevancy model selection histories user community 
model re rank search results past selections spy users shown approach lead significant improvements search accuracy 
spy collaborative search method strong assumptions form underlying search engines generally applicable range content types 
ranking metric computationally efficient number search results requires additional parsing result pages 
ability personalize search results needs community possible need store search histories individual user profiles stored user identification necessary 
significant security privacy advantages compared traditional approaches personalization
