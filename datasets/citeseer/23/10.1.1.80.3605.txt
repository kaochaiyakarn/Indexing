annotating music collections content similarity helps propagate labels way annotate music collections exploiting audio similarity 
similarity propose labels tags unlabeled songs content distance 
main goal ease process annotating huge music collections content similarity distances way propagate labels songs 
different experiments 
propagates labels related style piece second experiment deals mood labels 
hand approach shows music collection annotated styles collection automatically annotated annotated rest propagation recall greater 
hand smaller music collection annotated moods collection automatically annotated plus propagation 
manual annotations multimedia data arduous task time consuming 
automatic annotation methods normally fine tuned reduced domains musical instruments limited sound effects taxonomies mature label great detail possible sound 
music domain annotation complex due time domain frame 
purpose making music easily accessible implies condition describing music way machine learning understand 
specifically steps followed build music descriptions easily maintained exploit descriptions build efficient music access systems help users find music large collections 
lot ways describe music content basically classify descriptors groups editorial meta data cultural meta data acoustic meta data 
paradigmatic example music genome project big effort capture essence music fundamental level attributes describe austrian computer society

barrington significant advances semantic annotation songs music information retrieval mir mfcc describe music content hmm trained timbre rhythm computing similarity songs 
idea basically represented image semantic annotation supervised problem mir field works dealing problem detecting mood audio content 
results promising standard clearly defined proposals categories features 
experiments check tags styles moods propagated content cb similarity 
evaluation goal prove empirically contentbased similarity help propose labels unlabeled songs reducing hard effort manually annotating songs 
purpose content similarity seen black box 
say www com seed song module returns list ith similar songs 
study employs cb module considers features mfcc musical descriptors related rhythm tonality

problem collection human annotated tracks normally ground truth nature pair reviewed 
validated large amount annotated songs listening 
propagation music style labels ground truth style experiment consists different labels rock instrumental classical relaxing annotated songs 
evaluation process partially annotated collection cb module get ith similar songs tags propose tags tags similar songs 
propose tags appeared frequency 
evaluation metrics metrics evaluate styles experiments initially precision recall measure giving weight recall 
case recall informative purpose know tags propagated 
take account frequencies ranking tags obtained similar songs 
spearman rank correlation coefficient spearman defined di represents distance rank pair values case labels ground truth labels proposed tags compute distances assume frequency manually annotated labels equal

see interesting exception annotated collection performs better new propagated labels low recall 
due random process splitting ground truth test set collection
