main lines discussion workshop closed discussion 
mainly topics 
invited talk gave reason question relationship web services grids 
second number contributions combined aspect oriented techniques web services promoted potential constellation 
addressing just facets new trends standards discussion turned vast proliferation web service arena raised general questions rationale evolution 
thread returned foundation evaluated basic web service standards nearly half decade emergence wsdl soap 
web services grids 
motivated talk byrne brought experience initial thread discussion relation web services grid 
especially open grid service architecture ogsa infrastructure regarded 
fact situation manifold hand web service technology facilitates ogsa capabilities 
ogsa builds extension wsdl enables inheritance port types defines additional port types vital features stable state maintenance lifecycle management 
grid services far sophisticated traditional web services 
hand grid services intended finer grained entities web services 
grid services tailored represent low level resources web service normally positioned close application level business objects 
result technical relationship confused usage entities business business interaction scenario web services choice representing organizational endpoints cross organizational interactions grid services offer means implement beneath 
answers main questions emerged web services grid services integrated 
answer reside different level abstraction 
web services aop 
lively discussion relation web services separation concerns aspect oriented programming 
object oriented development quite application web services come surprise 
alternatives combination 
utilize aspect oriented language implement web services factor service properties aspects 
approach ortiz see section report positive results aspectj purpose 
positive experiences direction told attendees aop workshop 
question dynamics approaches 
certainly possibility aspects static development web services benefit better allow adaptation service properties running systems service management systems 
different idea discussed separation concerns service composition 
possibility code service composition logic aspect oriented languages prevent hard coding factoring composition aspects 
aspect oriented concepts applied workflow evolution 
workflow underlying principle service composition approaches worthwhile investigate separation concerns collaborative service processes 
evolution web service standards 
session discussion shifted evolution development web services 
ongoing process organisations including diverse standard bodies oasis wsi 
companies ibm microsoft 
flooding web service scene growing number standard specifications discussed critically 
means coordinated process fact numerous approaches overlap contradict completely clear indicator 
mention obviously consistent complete vast majority new web service specifications keeps quite implementation issues just state properties web services 
regards foundational established core web service standards wsdl soap little worries subsequently pressing need evolve felt participants 
contrary mind plenum direction applying better understanding stable core 
return point eventually complex application scenarios applications reached web service core comes conceptual limits dating back middleware roots 
workshop perceived positive experience everybody 
competency motivation participants concentrated productive atmosphere terms interesting presentations single contributions fruitful discussions 
result concluded web service research enters advanced early stage far goals business interaction aimed general service oriented computing paradigm 
fact centre gravity close middleware system integration 
basic principles setting understood start settled knowledge represented example design patterns 
basis attention shifts sophisticated issues 
concepts object orientation web services entered object oriented arena aligned transferred web services 
example obvious trend separation concerns web services witnessed service implementation utilisation aspect oriented technology service models aspects service composition logic 
case web services benefit experience objectoriented community case shows relationship sided innovative power young web service discipline pays back currency new concepts issues scope
