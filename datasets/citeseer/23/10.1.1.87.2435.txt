decomposition business processes means architecture soa organisation theory business process defined set interconnected activities collectively realize business objective policy goal normally context organisational structure defining functional roles relationships 
business processes supported information systems labelled workflows 
achieve optimal support underlying architecture decompose business processes conceptually activities called process patterns 
collaborate business process owners organisation 
decomposition continued process patterns optimal granularity 
optimal granularity determined business context functional handling optimal support information systems 
demonstrates approach means generic credit process 
credit process decomposed process patterns loan request credit networking electronic commerce research conference october riva del italy assessment servicing 
example process pattern credit assessment decomposed process patterns internal external rating decision 
closer look internal rating activity decomposed process patterns responsible evaluation required documents loan requestor income employment 
decomposition generic credit process functionality process patterns provided called services 
context service defined self contained software component provides defined functionality 
architectural approach services called service oriented architecture soa 
soa characterised loosely coupling services involved 
means services replaced services runtime 
services communicate sending receiving messages 
shows mapping conceptually modelled process patterns services 
services encapsulate functionality legacy systems 
advantages approach twofold hand operation existing legacy systems possible 
hand despite monolithic legacy applications business processes modified recombining existing upcoming services flexible manner 
consequence modification business processes mainly affects order different service invocations underlying legacy systems 
approach follows paradigm level programming means clear distinction business process modelling implementation 
context modelling workflow definition data control flow called programming large implementation process patterns named programming small 
mapping process patterns services services loosely coupled architectural approach allows integration services offered external service providers 
compared traditional business process outsourcing complete process outsourced activities

approach allows higher flexibility 
service business process outsourcing architectural approach supports reusability process patterns different business processes 
advantages reusability cost reduction reliability faster development process

consequence business processes composed combining process patterns construction kit
