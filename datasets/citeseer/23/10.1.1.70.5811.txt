daml ontology approach description web services developed part darpa agent markup language program 
daml aims providing common ontology services inspired research area called semantic web encompasses efforts populate web content services having formal semantics 
build top daml oil design daml follows layered approach semantic web markup languages 
ultimate goal daml provide ontology allows agents users discover invoke compose web services 
currently structure daml ontology threefold consists service profile advertising discovering services process model gives detailed description service operation service grounding provides details interoperate service message exchange 
wsmf web service modeling framework provides concept semantic web technology developing describing web services composition

adding query terms search easily specific return empty results 
personalized selection services input parameters need cooperative service behavior handle soft constraints 
cooperative retrieval techniques introduced research area cooperative answering experience finding right query pose database difficult matter

typical behavior querying databases starting general query getting specific results returned starting quite specific query generalizing dropping attributes results returned 
traditional databases task performed user 
enabling user decide parts query dropped parts order gradually relaxed helpful technique 
user instance didn specify airline query flight booking service choice carriers query relaxed value 
shown possible booking services generalized don carrier input parameter 
user certain preferences specific airline

hand personalization problems choosing services reasonable combinations 
consider instance sample user michael having goal attending business meeting different city 
depending characteristics starting point meeting place ways achieving goal applied possibly involving variety different services 
instance journey spans long distance service booking flight probably book flight book train airport taxi business location station decomposition services business trips public transport car rental taxi public transport car rental taxi 
michael decide travel train 
flights supply transportation airports goal decomposed pieces finding possible convenient airports departure arrival transporting business person office apartment airport booking flight chosen destination transporting business person airport business location 
sample graph decomposition shown 
decomposition need flight booking service single service components traveling airport airport involve services steps 
instance transportation business person office airport involve taxi service public transportation decomposed bus subway service 
transportation destination airport business location may simple kind getting taxi involve complex tasks car 
complex tasks generally consist services decomposed 
simple example identify twelve different ways doing business trip

web services respect similar 
designing certain web service designers quite specific ideas capabilities service provide 
designers anticipate different possibilities usage service defined services useful decompositions certain typical queries service requests generally exist 
typical interactions different user groups referred usage patterns 
usage pattern depends intention users 
generally speaking different intentions need different patterns 
different user groups typical strategies achieve kind goal groups clustered assigned different usage patterns 
consider example service traveling 
course locations departure destination supplied differ usage usage possible decompositions train booking flight 
generally speaking train slower cheaper flight 
distinguishing groups travelers assign simple strategies 
business travelers time probably important money 
trigger default business travel patterns example choice avoiding train choosing business class tickets minimization flight time changing planes trip achieved 
different general rules domain knowledge apply 
instance relaxation constraints arrival date time far difficult service usage pattern tourists 
typical tourist patterns probably concerned money try minimize costs train adequate choice flying business class considered desirable 
tourist pattern service flexible relaxing time constraints 
composing different services usage patterns seen representation different possibilities strategies users apply decompose task 
sub goals chosen obviously direct impact subsequent services performed accomplish complex task 
consider sample usage scenario 
complex transportation problem destination airport boston business location broken sub goals 
possibility car airport taxi public transportation 
way subsequently chosen strongly depends individual user matter adequate personalization techniques personal profiles stating preferred decomposition strategies dislikes 
strategies typically override general terms pattern 
example user suffers fear flying personal profile definitely state dislike flying part business travel pattern prefers fast ways traveling 
case specific personal profile override general profile 

summary outlook raised question personalization web service selection 
today web service discovery execution performed standards uddi wsdl ebxml limited semantic meaning services description 
approaches semantic web daml wsmf efforts try provide semantically rich service descriptions 
letting aside problems different ontologies missing concepts interoperability human interaction services poses severe problems due lack personalization 
today service variety offers users choose different services perform specific task 
seamless integration networks variety expected grow orders magnitude 
task selecting adequate service quickly grow tedious services listed certain description compared manually final selection 
final selection depend service parameters execution costs accuracy depends usefulness objects information service offers 
interacting web service user brings lots expectations 
complex goal strategies compose different services certain preferred ways achieve sub goals hard constraints met lot preferences knowledge implicitly previous service uses knowledge domain 
addressed steps service discovery selection composition 
finding useful means personalization step argued divide user profile different parts part decompose goals relies typical usage pattern anticipated service provider helps break complex task preferred sub goals solved simple web services second part consists preferred service parameters helps choose discovered services advertise perform task may differ typical parameters execution costs 
third part deals preferred characteristics objects information service claims provide 
part helps choose objects different services discard services principle handle task don provide desirable objects 
considering sample interaction shown deal different profiles algorithm subsequent selection appropriate services 
algorithm features expansion service request user specific demands wishes 
services matching certain profile discarded fly equally useful results alternative services compared respect user provided strategies 
techniques cooperative answering showed get better service selection including users long term profiles risking run empty result sets 
aiming improved usability web services focus subsequent refinement integration ways personalization standard interaction techniques 
repositories user profiles domain knowledge usage patterns generation new patterns investigated 
consider specific characteristics personalization techniques heuristics dealing different client devices 
case instance mobile devices limited capabilities extension basic techniques pave way improved usability enabling user specific context aware selection appropriate services
