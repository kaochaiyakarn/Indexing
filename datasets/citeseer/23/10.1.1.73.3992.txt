description logic description logics monotonic formalisms order logic 
essentially description logics comprised atomic concepts atomic roles 
atomic concepts related particular entities knowledge base example man may concept bill instance concept 
atomic roles express binary relationships individuals may instance bill parent conclude bill associated role haschild example haschild bill peter haschild role binds father bill son peter 
description logic characterised set constructors facilitate building complex concepts roles 
concepts interpreted sets objects roles seen binary relations objects domain 
description logic allows representation concept conjunctions concept disjunctions concept negations 
concept conjunction relates ability join concepts define complex concept properties characteristics 
concept conjunction illustrated example father man parent see instances set men appear instances set parents defined subsuming set instances concept father say instances concept father instances set concepts man parent 
guido governatori concept disjunction relates ability restrict definition complex concept properties characteristics appearing set concept 
concept disjunction illustrated example person man woman see instances set person appear set man set woman 
reason set instances man subset set people furthermore set woman subset person 
concept negation construct allows complex concepts defined negation concept 
useful situations want define concepts disjoint concept seen example woman man person example concept man negated denote instances domain appear set man unioned concept person appears subset concept woman 
instances set woman appear set instances concept person set man description logic allows value role restriction constructs 
role restriction construct requires individuals specified relationship concept described belong concept role restriction illustrated example haschild female returns individuals daughters sons 
description logics offer constructors lower abstractions logic focus constructors

semantics description logic terms interpretation consisting non empty set interpretation function defined symbolically interpretation function gives extension concepts roles assigns atomic concept subset atomic role binary relation semantic interpretation operators described defined follows syntax semantics defeasible description logics description logics knowledge bases tboxes aboxes 
tboxes contain concept definitions concept definitions define new concepts preexisting concepts 
example concept definition woman person female equivalence allows case instance woman created instance person female 
way tboxes description logic knowledge bases provide definite strict representations conditions required create new concepts turn instances concepts 
tboxes contain definition unique concept name spirit developing conflict free knowledge bases 
furthermore definition cyclically 
aboxes conversely contain assertional information define specific roles concepts known change circumstances 
example type information abox includes concept instance person jill role instance mother jill bill abox assertional information jill instance concept type person 
furthermore role binds instances jill bill mother role denotes jill bill mother 
tboxes unique names adhered aboxes exists instances concept instance name concepts interpreted equivalent 
subsumption basic reasoning method description logic 
concepts knowledge base illustrates subsumes 
requires proved subsumer general terms extension included extension example woman person guido governatori means concept woman considered specialised concept person 
set elements belonging concept woman set elements belonging concept person domain woman subset domain person formally woman person extension reasoning mechanism concept equivalence 
equivalence reasoning mechanism concepts checked see set instances concept set instances concept 
reasoning mechanism represented symbolically example equivalence check description logic may involve verifying set mothers equivalent set women children concept satisfiability reasoning mechanism employed description logics 
concept satisfiability relates check performed ensure exists semantic interpretation concept result empty set 
represented symbolically means extension equivalent empty set extension concept
