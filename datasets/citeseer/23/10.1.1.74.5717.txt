trails change system functionality original intentions created designer system ends 
users walk certain paths frequently get worn increase importance 
system changes usage reflecting usage real interpretation mean trails 
discussion goal bear significant way context debate 
constructivism contradicts realism explicating analyzing differences crucial bring unity disparate research 
importantly shown dichotomy just hand waving manifests applications fundamentally different ways thinking uses contexts 
view context simply new environment dealt old natural sciences concepts methods techniques 
believe context entails just location task 
context situational sense making humans interactive systems 
context viewed sum situational actions resources plans emotions technologies people different resources integrate fabrics interactions actors 
contexts emerge actions emergent properties achievements negotiated reciprocal relationships actors complex interactions humans computers see 
conclude analyzing relationship dichotomy proposed previous ones relationship user centered design 
discuss find balance approaches 
constructivism phenomenology 
dourish similar arguments divided approaches context different camps 
critical reader ask picked different terms 
realism maps loosely views context representational problem best represent context computer 
contrary concept constructivism wider dourish phenomenological approach overly emphasizes role individual person experiences simple human computer interactions construction contexts 
dourish analysis deduces attempts see contexts constructed interactional achievements phenomenological roots 
analysis account adequately different strands philosophical underpinnings constructivism ethnomethodology constructivism large excellent overview see 
choosing term constructivism want highlight contexts constructed complex interaction interpretation chains include computers resources people 
user centered design approaches observations representative applications examples realism sort autonomous agents decisions behalf user 
naturally triggers ucd issues user correctness interpretations transparency control privacy trust empowerment 
interestingly context inference non issue constructivism definition context information resource human action accounted users social situations 
shifts focus improving correctness machine inference social interaction 
labeling contexts imply obtrusive behaviors 
oulasvirta distinguished types proactive behaviors resource management scheme 
proactive behaviors prepare optimize suggest manipulate inhibit finalize user resources 
categorizing labeling contexts fails believe labeling approach especially suitable types operations potentially unobtrusive user 
preparing new resources optimizing going ones suggesting new ones user harmless realistic idea context 
example resource preparation best guesses context aware annotation system 
developed system context interpretations fill mobile image metadata annotation fields name location easily overridden user wrong 
naturally design remedies design challenges example context faked user 
potential turning labels resources users construct interaction 
conclude noting researchers fall categories goal stir theoretical debate foundations field keeping mind practical interest 
regard utmost importance balance approaches 
begins admitting fact automatic context interpretations arbitrary wrong especially concern mental social states
