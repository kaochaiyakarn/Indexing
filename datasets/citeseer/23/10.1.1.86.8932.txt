introduces thin layer transport underlying routing layers puts tcp persist mode network gets disconnected packet losses due high bit error rate 
thin layer acts shield tcp protecting underlying behavior ad hoc network 
different context nack oriented reliable multicast protocol norm provides nack reliability similar atp employs rate transmissions 
fundamental differences exist tcp atp terms start behavior congestion control reliability mechanisms hold true norm atp 
approaches proposed leverage multi path routing ad hoc networks atp designed single path connections 
note tcp designed single path connections suffer drastically multi path routing 
transport layer framework tandem atp effectively support connections traversing multiple paths
