auction plague electronic auction websites 
unfortunately literature tried formulate solve problem 
aims tackle suggesting novel method detect auction fraudsters involves determining extracting characteristic features exposed fraudsters analyzing fraudsters transaction history exists graph 
features detecting potential fraudsters 
choosing best features challenging non trivial task features currently selected method achieved precision recall evaluation real test data ebay 
demonstrate method real world developed working java prototype system allows users query legitimacy ebay users method 
electronic auction websites created huge virtual marketplace world population easily buy sell virtually items 
electronic auction person post items people bid 
person placing highest bid winner auction contact seller pay item 
seller ship item buyer 
electronic auction business ebay world largest electronic auction website reached cumulative number registered users representing increase reported 
day millions dollars sales involved electronic auction transactions 
huge sum money unfortunately attracted perpetrators attention large number commit auction far serious problems ebay faces 
number reported auction increasing past years trend shows problem getting worse 
internet crime complaint center ic referred complaints auction

auction fraud involves sellers selling non existent items 
intentionally typically items post auction receive payment buyers deliver items buyers 
auction fraud problem getting increasingly serious 
believe computer scientists help solve problem 
belief motivated 
survey best authors knowledge uses systematic approach analyze detect electronic auction 
lot suggested common sense approaches websites news articles teach people avoid auction 
approaches involve asking people invest substantial amount time constantly maintain high level vigilance 
average people afford 
little research done suggesting systematic approaches detecting preventing auction fraud 
researchers categorized auction fraud different types suggested formalized methods dealing 
suggested effective approach fight auction fraud allow auction communities governments auction institutions join forces 
pointed approach costly monetary managerial means 
lot interest research areas related auction fraud detection reputation systems electronic auctions graph mining trust propagation authority propagation 
remotely related aggregating values set values graph 
proposed approach problem definition examine problem detecting auction fraudsters 
specifically define problem information electronic auction users profiles transaction history exposed fraudsters want find fraudsters profiles transaction history ebay users readily available ebay website appendix knowledge exposed fraudsters acquired news articles user forum ebay noting large number negative feedback buyers sellers saying fraudsters delivered items 
define auction fraud problem pieces information identify potential fraudsters carry 
possible person create multiple identities ebay 
order improve clarity discussion terms ebay user refer individual identities ebay individual persons 
intuition observed fraudsters show typical characteristic behaviors lifetime auction websites 
observed carry fraudulent transactions typically exist seemingly legitimate users order establish reputation coming fraudulent acts 
reputation building procedure different legitimate users 
believe identify fraudsters reputation build process inspecting features derivable profiles transaction history 
reputation important measure credibility electronic auction websites 
ebay person reputation represented number unique positive ratings dealers minus number negative ratings appendix 
resulting number user feedback score 
fraudsters usually aim gain time profit quickly possible 
usually sell moderate value expensive items categories consumer electronics 
legitimate users intend deliver items receiving payment buyers 
fraudsters carry fraudulent acts people ebay need establish certain level reputation 
positive ratings look suspicious auction users 
hypothesize auction fraudsters need reputation trick people believing legitimate 
believe fraudsters fabricate reputation methods exhibit certain patterns different legitimate ones discover fabrication process essentially identify take place 
observed patterns known publicized ebay learned common ways fraudsters fabricate reputation 
patterns typically legitimate users justified perspective fraudsters 
selling buying numerous cheap items users reputation 
justification fraudsters want gain ratings small cost 
selling buying moderate value expensive items collaborators 
collaborators may show fraudulent acts may generally act legitimate users 
justification fraudsters want gain strong ratings virtually incurring cost 
combination 
justification create legitimate looking illusion 

reputation fabrication process usually occurs short period time 
justification fraudsters short lived want remain ebay long increase risk discovered
