myers colleagues myers investigated application user supplied advice context modern planning techniques 
myers advisable planner employs model advice specifications provided user compiled language constraints common traditional planning algorithms 
myers distinguishes idioms advice 
task advice identifies goals actions included solution 
strategic advice recommends goals actions accomplished relative parameter values 
advice puts constraints metric defined plan resource usage execution time solution quality 
myers advice author gives planner grounded domain metatheory representation independent underlying planning technologies 
domain metatheory intended enhance user planning process aid generation qualitatively different plans aid plan summarization 
myers proposes model built constructs roles features measures 
roles describe function object operator features attributes differentiate operators measures partial orderings features respect criterion 
example feature air associated operator loc loc item feature land associated loc loc item 
related features may grouped feature categories transport media category containing air land 
measure ordering possibly partial features feature category 
example measure defined feature category transport media rank land higher air measure comfort defined feature category transport media rank air land 
role fill specifies explicit object instances constraints set instances relative operator role 
measures may extended describe object instances domain assignment measure values 
example measure measure values defined cheap moderate expensive object instance jet measure value expensive object instance subway measure value cheap 
strategic advice specified metatheoretic elements activities roles role fills measures turn simpler closer natural cognitive models employed human experts lower level planning constructs goals operators variables bindings 
strategic advice consists prescriptions restrictions roles fillers relative specific activities 
advice takes forms 
role advice designates object role specifications role fills required restricted specific activities 
example role template stay accommodation location instantiated stay star hotels scotland role location filled scotland filler star hotel prescribed role accommodation myers 
example target activity feature vacation

domain elaboration framework leverage results advisable mixed initiative planning introduces def domain elaboration framework 
def adaptation myers domain metatheory allows authors add detail classical planning domains enable expressive problem definition reasoning plans 
basis def strips fikes nilsson planning domain characterized objects conditions operators 
formally object symbol provides unique name entity world 
object instances predefined plan author 
condition conjunction function free literals composed unique name identifying relation set placeholder variable terms object instances

operator defined set literals stating preconditions hold invoked set literals stating effects hold invocation parameter list may applied designate variables sets literals 
metatheory introduced myers relies roles role fills features measures def uses alternate grammar types dimensions weights measurements 
type symbolic name node global hierarchy author defined types unique root node named 
operator parameter object instance required associated type 
type seen implicit concept myers original metatheory 
myers find explicit representation type

fact interactive narrative creation tool built def framework communicate type constraints parameters objects extending set preconditions operator initial goal states 
example case loc parameter move operator type constraint loc added operator list preconditions object instances type location created corresponding conditions added initial state planning problem 
planners allow special subset preconditions referring constraints truth values computed directly assignments initial state allowing faster processing 
planners type constraints may help speed plan search process reducing set objects planner consider bindings parameters operators literals 
types associated operators enabling author portion type hierarchy encompass entities features myers formulation 
operator parameter object instance associated types zero associated measurements 
measurement consists dimension weight 
dimension symbolic name selected global list unique author defined dimensions 
weight specifies relative intensity dimension normalized interval 
default weight represents neutral intensity maximally negative maximally positive 
expressive power def dimension construct def corresponds measure myers metatheory 
symbolic values chosen author defined list comfort magic 
key difference def uses numeric weights gauge instances dimension myers uses measure values set symbols defined feature category ordered plan author measure 
example def object instance jet may measurement dimension weight near minimal value scale 
myers metatheory object instance jet may assigned measure value expensive measure ordered set measure values cheap moderate expensive 
operator level def allows types dimensions describe operators way describe object instances 
myers uses features describe operators higher level abstraction def 
strategy chosen def reduced low level vocabulary elaborate problem domain description defer aggregation complex abstractions features feature categories higher level user interfaces 
hopefully allow abstractions arbitrary complexity interface level preserving underlying representation facilitates efficient reasoning qualities individual plans qualitative differences plans 
qualitative judgments plans myers measures converted proportionally distributed values interval 
def requires explicit normalization weights interval chosen facilitate default neutral weight 
clearly shifts responsibility interface ensure human authors assign weights normalization mind 
interface def provide abstractions symbolic ranges cheap moderate expensive convert values proportional internal representations 
interface precluded allowing precise non proportional numerical representations appropriate 
expressive advantage def types measurements applicable operator operator parameter condition parameter
