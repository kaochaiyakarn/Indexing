collaborating years architects build platform hosting virtual teams architects 
building virtual team software quite complex requires shared data management concurrent access control knowledge sharing security interoperability consistency coordination communication 
focus coordination problem 
gutwin pointed workspace awareness reduces effort needed coordinate tasks resources helps people move individual shared activities provides context interpret utterances allows anticipation actions 
research center architecture engineering www archi fr demonstrated workspace awareness widgets facilitate coordination synchronous groupware

multi synchronous groupware characterized parallel streams activities opposition standard techniques attempt maintain illusion single stream activity 
multi synchronous groupware environments involve simultaneous disconnected working manage thread control

section concludes pointers works 
motivations multi synchronous awareness widget basically multi synchronous applications characterized abilities support divergence parallel stream activities replicated objects 
dourish wrote notion multiple parallel streams activity natural approach supporting familiar pattern collaborative 
working activities proceed parallel multiple streams activity time participants disconnected divergence occurs periodically individual efforts integrated synchronization order achieve consistent state progress activity group 
main difference synchronous asynchronous multi synchronous applications modifications visibility integration 
standard collaborative applications modification performed user immediately visible 
multi synchronous applications modifications done user visible users validates modifications commit changes 
visible change imply immediate integration activities streams 
concurrent modifications integrated users decide 
allowing deferred validation changes divergence important advantages impacts parallelization activities divergence managed possible users realize main objective faster working parallel 
advantage lost costly integration stages 
privacy discussion architects clear architect want publish versions plans 
wants insulated private workspace waits pretty nice making visible 
responsibility making changes visible control architect 
visibility partial changes visibility partial changes dangerous intermediate observable states inconsistent 
architect starts change building change impact documents 
example architects observing changes roof plan confused plan consistent floor plan 
experimental changes useful try experimental solution warranty success 
architects insulated private workspaces changes want 
able cancel changes experimental changes achieved 
cancellation impact seen experimental changes 
main goal multi synchronous awareness widget people aware parallel stream activities 
working multi synchronous environment means living divergence inconsistencies 
obtain expected benefits parallelization divergence managed visualized simple way 
users develop huge divergence advantages parallelism lost difficult integration stage 
multi synchronous awareness widget help user answer classical questions 
answers take account divergence diverge 
divergence 
importance divergence 
divergence 
divergence increasing shrinking 
questions fundamental help people plan general strategy manage divergence 
important point number shared documents 
virtual team architects share documents 
building french stadium soccer world championship required documents 
awareness widget support large number shared documents 
users working documents visualize small window document working objective build awareness widget help people aware divergence large number documents 
working divergence state treemaps section scenario users making modifications arbitrary documents objects deferred validation changes 
deferred validation changes managed copy modify merge cmm paradigm 
working divergence copy modify merge paradigm working cmm paradigm fairly simple 
shared repository storing multi objects basic commands checkout object identifies object particular version default repository creates local copy object personal workspace user 
commit local object validates modifications done locally local copy creating new version object repository 
done local object date new unread version repository committed users 
update local object merges local copy version object stored repository 
stage assisted merge algorithms foo repository copy modify merge illustrates operations scheduled 
users foo bar working concurrently 
foo bar checkout objects repository create local copies private workspaces step 
disconnected want 
call regular tools text editor compiler 
local copies step 
user bar commits changes step creates new version shared object repository 
stage user foo date object publish changes 
user foo re synchronize version version step 
version downloaded repository stored private workspace foo 
foo calls merge tool step merge concurrent changes 
foo new version private workspace changes changes done bar merged 
commit version repository step 
way working largely software engineering community 
configuration management tools support cmm paradigm 
people working paradigm sourceforge making opensource software 
copy modify merge concurrency strategy representative multi synchronous applications 
private workspace represents stream activity 
copying objects users disconnected activity stream executes operations local copies 
divergence occur stage 
reach consistent stage users re synchronize overwriting concurrent changes 
strategy copy modify merge forces people reread version object local copy date 
merge stage executed locally activity stream 
people aware divergence realize importance divergence commit time 
cmm strategy force re read changes done users 
new changes impact local change local re done 
cmm prevents users loose data prevent developing huge divergence 
people aware importance divergence commit time may late 
state treemap help people aware divergence regular interval time control 
working state treemap widget treemap designed visualization huge trees objects 
treemaps help system managers visualize quickly large trees directories subdirectories 
system managers see immediately bigger files located 
represents simple transformation tree objects treemap
