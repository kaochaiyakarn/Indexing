appropriate keywords 
keyword selection requires skill knowledge target domain 
example keyword information retrieval find database huge number papers corresponding information retrieval retrieved 
people know phrase information retrieval generic avoid

difficulty formulating query increases number keywords increases 
observing different conditions information retrieval systems query produces result 
refine query previous result cleared new result displayed screen
