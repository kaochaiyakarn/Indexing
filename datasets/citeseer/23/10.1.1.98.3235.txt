google query interface query interface semsearch extends traditional keyword search languages allowing explicit specification queried subject ii combination keywords 
term subject user explicitly tell search engine expected type search results 
example user specifies keyword news subject keyword expects search results instances class entity matches keyword news 
allowing specification combine multiple keywords search engine provides users simple way expressing complex queries 
semsearch uses heuristic operators support specification user queries 
symbol supports specification query subjects 
second word indicates keywords connected word required connections search results 
word supports specification optional keywords 
user query semsearch looks subject keyword keyword keyword 
query syntax example news phd students easily specified news phd students term news query subject term phd students required keyword 
complex queries semsearch search engine semantic web multiple keywords subject keyword involved easily specified 
example querying projects enrico john participate query specified project enrico john 
user wants know projects enrico john involved query project enrico john 
order satisfy query required keywords please note subject special required keyword satisfied means search results semantically related required keywords 
case optional keywords optional keywords satisfied 
semsearch query interface provides simple flexible powerful approach specifying user queries semantic search 
overcomes problem knowledge overhead suffered formal query fronted search engines form semantic search engines require users familiar particular ontology semantic data special query language 
second query interface provides flexible way specifying queries interface form search engines 
confine users pre defined query subjects values 
third contrast current semantic keyword search engines accept keyword input query interface supports specification complex queries format specifying multiple keywords expected type results 
query interface simpler question answering tools search engine need spend time calculating keywords user query 
focus user queries keywords involved order better explain distinctive features search engine 
regarding queries comprise keyword search engine develops approach similar ones tap find instances closely related semantic entity matches keyword 
making sense user query mentioned earlier section making sense user query step search process semsearch task find semantic meanings keywords specified user query search engine knows user looking satisfy user query 
semantic point view keyword may match general concepts keyword phd students matches concept phd student ii semantic relations concepts keyword author matches relation author iii instances entities keyword enrico matches instance enrico motta keyword chief scientist matches values instance marc eisenstadt property job title 
ideal goal task find exact semantic meaning keyword 
easy achieve may semantic lei entity matches keyword 
relaxed goal finding semantic entity matches keyword 
purpose finding semantic entity matches labels semantic entities main search source 
rational choice user point view labels catch meaning semantic entities understandable way

trad research challenge need address 
translating user query formal queries step search engine takes input semantic matches user search terms outputs appropriate formal query semantic meanings keywords

specifically subject keyword matches ns semantic entities keyword nk matches ns nk queries need constructed 
example query news phd students formal queries need constructed 
subject keyword matches class news item keyword phd students matches semantic entities including class phd student instance phd 
generated formal queries slower search process 
problem acute keywords involved user query
