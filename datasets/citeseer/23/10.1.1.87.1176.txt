noted real usage jimminy differs test described important ways 
jimminy shows suggestions time experiment rated topmost suggestion displayed 
second suggestion similarity rating certain threshold jimminy display 
experiment scored top suggestions displayed due poor confidence suggestion 
cases suggestion automatically lowest score 
third suggestions computed body note features set note text set computed entire text note 
actual suggestions appear user typed entire note suggestions displayed note halfway entered may different 
experiment conducted entire notes collection means notes suggested taken query note written 
actual system notes written new topic necessarily produce related notes
