asked participants pretend interviewer personal friend requested world explorer tell interviewer trip application public photos available 
task san francisco task 
task interviewer asked participant tell san francisco participants live san francisco bay area relatively familiar city features 
particularly participant asked pretend interviewer friend visiting time town give interviewer quick photo overview tour things see san francisco 
task unfamiliar area task 
asked users explore area unfamiliar 
task relevant interesting asked users travel plans city going visit 
participants invited point map area explore possibly devising itinerary places worth visiting 
third tasks ensured places selected users sufficient amount data

discussion report major positive negative themes considerations world explorer risen interview sessions 
supply quotes participants team illustrate key points possible issues 
broadly speaking participants interaction fairly simple visualization metaphor clear tags represent photos taken flickr users 
recall primary effects world explorer interface improving recall participants performing tasks 
readily exposed tags interface reminded participants locations wanted discuss 
task san francisco particular participants simply examined world explorer interface explained viewed tags explicitly looking specific tags locations 
participant stated brings memories know exactly look thing lot pictures pulls familiar pictures things easily identify point 
task telling vacation participants reminded locations remembered 
memories triggered tags photographs shown tags 
participant saw diamond head tag reminded visiting diamond head beach hawaii 
participant examining paris oh god

course danger exposing tags having users concentrate available tags dig task hand 
usually problem participants sought elements wanted discuss immediately shown 
discovery strong element discovery expressed interviews 
world explorer visualization allowed participants discover locations elements previously unknown 
aspect pronounced explored unknown places occur places participants familiar 
participant music journalist surprised find new music browsing chicago task heard music festival points tag music festival points intonation music festival 
interface prompted users explore known map areas serendipitous discoveries 
example looking locations new york city participant attracted tags nearby locations heard lots stories island distracted 
needle haystack number issues deficiencies world explorer pointed users tasks discussed 
prominently address needle vs haystack question information seeking behavior seen raised participants 
participants usually perform tasks world explorer expressed need explicit search interface look specific tags landmarks 
participants thought see interface missed ability search 
need commonly expressed participants looking specific locations landmarks city familiar tasks 
example browsing barcelona task participant said guess looking bull fighting pictures 
way search 
participant vacation los angeles task said easy navigate san francisco know place los angeles just flat city 
needle issue occurred participant knew exactly map area browse find photos wanted show world explorer available detail area 
case participants seen photos anyway looking photos specific street corner point interest important represented tag 
participant disappointed able show french street san francisco task photographed french part town think people pleasantly surprised 
contrast haystack style interaction world explorer needle oriented service conducted additional interviews participants interacted flickr map system 
interviews done similar conditions similar tasks 
mentioned flickr system displays photos markers map map area user navigates 
markers enlarged show actual photos 
flickr map system supports search feature allows user search photos current map view keyword 
participants search keyword feature primary method finding photos interest navigated map interface location interest 
search functionality proved effective method locations user familiar recall relevant keywords points interest location 
geographic locations unfamiliar user search keyword feature proved ineffective 
participant said went city knew looking didn know name don think find 
probably wouldn system participant said useful re familiar area know names specific locations 
need know looking participant said sense attractions order search participant stuck edinburgh wouldn know start summarize support world explorer gave users navigating unknown areas substantially effective regular map interface 
considerations participants pointed possibility world explorer share location experience remote friends family 
participant example interested sharing vibe neighborhood done google image searches try show neighborhood live friends 
participant wanted share browsing experience telephone thing pick phone call new york tell tap miami florida see pictures 
great way share information people 
interaction maps exploration received users comfortable maps users comfort level high 
participant personally am map person liked integration planning decide visit plot don need help 
hand despite claiming really sense direction participant able find locations recall names tags went record stores cant remember name 
points easy street records 
specific issue raised lack tags 
users felt tags specific locations 
expressed tasks rarely mentioned browsing san francisco 
believe due relative sparseness photographs locations remedied data added system 
participants appeared difficulties visible tags match mental model location 
instance certain zoom levels san francisco area tag visible available users complained important displayed 
possibly remedied giving users personalized view tags tags tailored interests 
participant requested filter help plan trip tags really interesting pick kind person am kind trip new york really different dad filter really help visit new york way half participants wanted information tags especially unknown locations 
participant summarized think just looking pictures doesn really help need text go 
example opera see buildings look buildings doesn really give feel 
text helpful don know see opera building 
non technical participants discover zooming functionality map 
quite happy drag pan map consider possibility zooming map get information 
possible better visual design application zoom slider fix issue problem scope 
conclude participants independently communicated benefits world explorer 
participant definitely going new city 
useful detailed lot time sent go ll go straight hotel 
system see general vicinity getting talking hotel find local information participant liked familiar idea looking 
mean pretty places highlighted pretty popular people lot pictures probably pretty important place visit 
participant super trip planning
