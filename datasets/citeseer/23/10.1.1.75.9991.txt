previous research focused allowing grown children check status schedules aging parents research demonstrates symmetric sharing information desirable 
second technology peoples homes needs stable consistent easy trouble shoot generations reality may possible 
controlled lab situation accommodate existing computers families homes deal unreliable commercial internet providers constraints university network rules 
result issues doing research families requires lot time lot patience part researchers families 
families busy lives accommodate visits researchers install malfunctioning technologies don understand 
researchers travel families homes outside regular hours technology glitches result working uncontrolled environment inexperienced users 
despite challenges feel project success 
identified new scenario shared family calendaring demonstrated feasibility usability layered calendaring solution digital pens developed new techniques working families partners design new technologies 
interviews highlighted closely knit families stay touch regular visits phone conversations difficulties remembering dates activities 
field study suggests users maintain home calendars glean valuable information calendar heightened sense awareness current planned activities increase amount communication
