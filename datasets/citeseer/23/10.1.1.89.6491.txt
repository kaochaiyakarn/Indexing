sunny consolvo peter brett shelton type display behavior useful way grab user attention significant happened normal circumstances avoided 
solution come incorporating motion detector display detect display 
providing sufficient information complicating display carenet display main screen contained icons represent types information number events example meal icons represent breakfast lunch dinner 
icon conveyed event state time display updated effort provide user complete information portray false sense okay may 
example icon representations states event occurred planned unexpected occurred event occurred isn time lunch event occur passed elder eat elder chosen share event system report event red icons unexpected state 
participants understood subtle visual differences icon representation elder chosen share states distinguished icon color 
participants just looked see icons red 
icon representations confuse participants may gotten false sense okay notice difference example system able update event gray icon event occurred planned black icon 
deployment interviews event occurred important distinction care network members know time lunch passed 
find states important 
research conducted investigate effectively communicate distinctions overly complicating display compromising ambient quality 
providing human touch sensor data deployment interviews care network members elders talked vision sensors collecting data evaluators collected deployments 
mixed reactions sensors elder home consistent reaction significant contributors peripherally involved members type data provided 
expressed importance data having human touch afraid sensors provide impersonal data 
cases wanted know qualitative details events example just elder carenet display elder feeling bad merely feeling bad 
popular suggestion incorporate daily narrative provided drastic life elder doing day 
discussed idea adding human touch drastic life posing narrative idea expressed concern immediately suspected responsibility fall 
alternative may able satisfy display users drastic life interactive system prompts elder provide verbal narrative added display 
interesting challenge area convey human quality data largely provided sensors adding responsibilities members 
privacy considerations carenet display provides ways elder control information decides see type information choose share update event permission type event granted 
elder study took advantage controls important elders care network members controls available 
elders gave enhanced sense control increased trust technology 
care network members thought controls important elder maintain independence possible thought important signify problem 
participant words mom didn want share eating probably reason designs explore levels disclosure alerting certain network members unexpected occurs member normally see medication information receive elder misses medication 
discussed idea carenet display members elder care network deployments households network displays 
prior deployment earlier research elders claimed comfortable sharing information local members care networks 
exceptions mentioned members lived distance elders saw reason share details events medications meals members immediately come assistance bad happened
