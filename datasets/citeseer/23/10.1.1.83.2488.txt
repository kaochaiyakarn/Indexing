chapter expand settings allow sharing information different users 
dis explores additional benefits harvested type sharing 
provide details various parts thesis 
chapter note chapter contribution photo collection inherent semantic gap 
chapter describe set algorithms execute personal collection photos 
system utilizes time loca tion information embedded digital photographs automatically organize personal photo collection 
generates meaningful grouping photos location event hierarchies seemingly flat collection photos 
hierarchies created algorithms industry standard header supports time location coordinate fields 
interleave time location produce organization mimics way people think photo collections 
addition algorithm annotates generated hierarchy meaningful geographical names 
chapter test approach case studies real world geo referenced photo collections 
verify results meaningful useful collection owners 
chapter perform task evaluation com pare performance map application 
constructed browser employs graphical user interface elements photos 
users interact system textual menus created automated organization respec tive photo collection clustered locations events 
application compare features rich visual interface includes map timeline 
third party implementation 
con extensive user study subjects performed tasks geo referenced photo collections 
participants enjoyed visual richness map browser surprisingly performed text richer visual alternative 
result argues hybrid approach encourages textual user interface designs maps choice 
example maps limited feasibility hand held devices candidates replacing traditional photo wallet 
chapter introduces way help alleviate semantic gap adding additional context information photo 
idea context photo taken suggest content photo provide clues finding photos collection 
fortunately time location information digital photographs automatically generate abundance related contextual metadata shelf web data sources 
metadata local daylight status weather conditions time place photo taken 
con text metadata potential serving memory cues filters browsing photo collections especially collections grow tens thousands span dozens years 
example user may remember certain photo taken 
rain may part content photo say picture taken indoors context may help user retrieve relevant photograph 
describe contextual metadata automatically assemble photograph time location browser interface extension interface chapter utilizes metadata 
results user study survey expose categories contextual metadata useful recalling finding photographs 
identify unavailable metadata categories promising develop 
chapter shows identity people appear photos important category personal photo collections collection owners remember photos identity people want retrieve photos identity queries 
chapter tackles exactly problem 
chapter aim determining identity people photos personal photo collection 
recognizing people faces images famous example computer struggle bridge gap visual semantic 
face detection recognition algorithms major focus research years support reliable retrieval photo collection high recall precision 
limited circumstances personal photo collection number interesting people exceed dozens modern face recognition techniques perform 
complicating factor personal collections faces aligned 
photos faces shown profile slanted tilted partially wholly obscured fact detection recognition difficult task 
system describe chapter suggests identities ap pear photos personal photo collection 
face recognition techniques system leverages automatically available context time location photos taken utilizes notions compu tation event location groupings photos shown chapter 
user annotates identities people subset photos collection patterns re occurrence occurrence different people different locations events emerge 
system uses patterns generate label suggestions identities annotated 
suggestions greatly accelerate process manual annotation 
alterna tively suggestions serve prior candidate set face recognition algorithm 
face recognition accuracy may improve considering fewer assigning confidence partially context 
incorporate recognition algorithms thesis leave 
obtained ground truth identity annotation different personal photo collections annotation test system 
system proved effective making accurate label suggestions number suggestions photo limited names small subset photos annotated 
chapter introduce user input specifically annotation identities photographs 
chapter leverage type user input free text captions users may enter photos collection 
introduce concept implicitly sharing information photographs tween users 
sharing allow build system translate 
semantic gap visual representa tion object photo building geographical landmark geographical feature example alleviated 
specifically chapter describes locale system allows users implicitly share labels photographs 
photograph label locale shared information assign label labels photographs taken area 
locale allows text search unlabeled set photos ii automated label suggestions unlabeled photos 
implemented locale prototype supports tasks 
chapter describes system experiment ran test system stanford university campus 
results show locale performs search tasks surprising accuracy searching specific landmarks
