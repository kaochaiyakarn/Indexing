begins overview existing research short text message classification section 
section describes case approach 
section discusses evaluation case approach short test messages describing datasets evaluation methodology appropriate configuration classifier short text 
section compare performance case classifier machine learning approaches na bayes nb support vector machines svm popular text classification 
concludes section directions 
review existing short text classification approaches machine learning approach text classification studied analysed years little previous short text classification domain 
techniques text classification datasets large documents scientific papers suffer documents training corpus short 
performance loss attributed weak signature concept modeled due short length text 
previous research short text classification focused including additional information training data aid classification process 
approach short text classification uses latent semantic indexing lsi 
lsi unsupervised learner creates reduced vector space singular value decomposition svd 
combines training data unlabeled test examples creating reduced vector space 
concludes expanded feature space includes semantic associations help classify short text documents 
unlabeled background information related way training data

healy datasets assessment types datasets contain short text messages corpus customer comments corpus short message service sms messages 
customer comments corpus consists comments guests visiting hotels part large hotel chain
