idea gained thinking thinking 
traditionally cognitive science artificial intelligence thinking reasoning cast decision cycle loop similar shown 
intelligent agent perceives stimuli environment behaves rationally achieve goals selecting action set competencies

metareasoning process reasoning reasoning cycle 
consists meta level control computational activities introspective monitoring reasoning see 
cyclical arrangement represents higher level reflection standard action perception cycle represents perception reasoning control 
ground level action selection perception object level doing reasoning 
action perception cycle manifesto draft goal meta level control improve quality decisions spending effort decide reasoning opposed actions 
balances resources object level actions computations ground level actions behaviors 
meta level control allows agents dynamically adapt object level computation interfere ground level performance 
identifying decision points require meta level control importance performance agents operating resource bounded environments 
ground level action selection control object level perception monitoring 
duality reasoning acting meta level doing reasoning metareasoning introspective monitoring necessary gather sufficient information effective meta level control decisions 
monitoring may involve gathering computational performance data build profile various decision algorithms 
involve generating explanations object level choices effect ground level performance 
reasoning fails task may involve explanation causal contributions failure diagnosis object level reasoning process 
banner distributed metareasoning significant research questions exist concerning extent meta level control monitoring affects multi agent activity 
multi agent systems quality joint decisions affects individual outcomes value obtained agent exploring portion decision space dependent degree agents exploring complementary parts spaces 
problem coordinated meta level control refers question agents coordinate strategies maximize value joint actions 
complete cognitive system reasons actions world necessarily combine aspects metareasoning 
truly intelligent agent conception self controls reasoning choices represents products monitoring coordinates self social contexts

introspective monitoring reasoning performance requires agent maintain kind internal feedback addition perception perform effectively evaluate results metareasoning
