change detection line differencing compares text files 
algorithm finds sequences lines common files interspersed groups differing lines 
xml diff consider xml text file hierarchical structured data tree 
considering xml documents structured data tree trees compared equal nodes equal subtrees xml trees matched 
nodes subtrees aren matched different xml trees 
lot say context differences changes xml tree newer version 
example id name example name description example description example example id name example number name description example description example difference example versions xml tree describes versions xml tree 
second version contains extra word number 
line difference algorithms consider changed line 
file doesn contain line brakes change line file considered changed 
parsing file xml tree algorithm finds name node changed 
file contains example nodes having name node algorithm sort path specification identifying name node location 
changes gathered delta script delta file 
delta script contains representation changes 
purpose delta script patch file words apply changes recreate changed file 
useful original version location needs updated transferring changed file 
party recreate changed file original file delta script 
changes called operations common operation types insert delete 
algorithms specify updates specified combination delete insert 
common move update specified combination delete insert 
advantage update move lower size delta script delete insert potentially lead large resulting delta script 
operation type copy lead smaller delta script 
match certain node algorithm remove comparing 
copy supported algorithm needs node comparing trying detect copies node
