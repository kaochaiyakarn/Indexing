tabulator provides views map view table view calendar view different tabs 
underlying views query result management system

views easily extensible view object knows draw remove query information 
views dynamically load query results returned 
map view view offers user advantage displaying multiple queries single view order compare geographical locations 
map view accomplishes implementing google maps api plot rdf latitudes come specific query 
additionally map view handle addresses newly introduced feature google maps api 
may able simply location address table view users sense highly accurate set coordinates 
map view user overcome barrier get meaningful information simple coordinates
