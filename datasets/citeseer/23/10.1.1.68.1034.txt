word sentiment classifier word classification models word sentiment classification developed models 
basic approach assemble small amount seed words hand sorted polarity lists positive negative grow adding words obtained wordnet miller fellbaum 
assume synonyms positive words positive antonyms negative positive word synonyms antonyms evil 
antonyms negative words added positive list synonyms negative 
start seed lists selected verbs positive negative adjectives positive negative adding nouns 
adjectives verbs structured differently wordnet obtained synonyms antonyms adjectives synonyms verbs 
seed word extracted wordnet expansions added back appropriate seed lists 
expanded lists extracted additional cycle words wordnet obtain positive adjectives negative adjectives positive verbs negative verbs 
synonyms antonyms opposite sentiment neutral 
addition common words great strong take get occurred times positive negative categories 
indicated need develop measure strength sentiment polarity alternative simply discard ambiguous words determine strongly word positive strongly negative 
enable discard sentiment ambiguous words retain strengths threshold 
armed measure assign strength sentiment polarity unseen words 
new word wordnet obtain synonym set unseen word determine interacts sentiment seed lists 
compute arg max arg max syn syn syn sentiment category positive negative unseen word wordnet synonyms compute equation tried different models arg max arg max arg max syn syn syn arg max count fk synset fk th feature list word sentiment class member synonym set count fk synset total number occurrences fk synonym set number words class divided total number words considered 
model derives document classification 
synonym antonym lists obtained wordnet learning word sets corpus simpler doesn require manually annotated data training 
equation shows second model word sentiment classifier 
arg max arg max count arg max count compute probability word sentiment class count occurrence synonyms list intuition synonyms occuring word belongs 
computed positive negative sentiment strengths word compared relative magnitudes 
table shows examples system output computed equation represents positive category strength negative 
word amusing example classified carrying primarily positive sentiment blame primarily negative 
absolute value category represents strength sentiment polarity 
instance afraid strength represents strong strength represents weaker negativity 
negative adequate positive afraid negative negative amusing positive answerable positive positive averse negative blame negative table sample output word sentiment classifier

system best model performed accuracy manually provided holder accuracy automatic holder detection 
problems word sentiment classification mentioned words strong positive negative sentiment 
words difficult pick sentiment category considering context 
second unigram model sufficient common words sentiment combine produce reliable sentiment 
example term limits really hit democracy says prof common multi meaning word hit express negative point view term limits 
combinations occur bigrams trigrams seed word list 
occur distance difficult identify sentiment correctly especially words falls outside sentiment region 
sentence sentiment classification single sentence holder express different opinions 
system detects closest 
difficult problem models infer sentiments facts sentence 
thinks term limits give women opportunities politics expresses positive opinion term limits absence adjective verb noun sentiment words prevents classification 
relatively easy task people detecting opinion holder simple 
result system picks adjective test adjectives verb test verbs lenient agreement lenient agreement recall recall basic method wrong holder multiple plausible opinion holder candidates 
employing parser delimit opinion regions accurately associate potential holders help 
discussion combination models best 
best performance provided model 
apparently mere presence negative words important sentiment strength 
manually tagged holder topic model highest single performance model averages best 
better sentence region 
manually identified topic holder region window holder sentence performs better regions 
scores differ manual automatic holder identification 
table compares average results automatic holder identification manually annotated holders different models 
sentences misclassified automatic detection method 
positive negative total human human table average difference manual automatic holder detection 
adding neutral sentiment separate category affect score 
confusing humans distinguish neutral opinion bearing sentences 
previous research built sentence subjectivity classifier 
unfortunately cases classifies neutral weak sentiment sentences non opinion bearing sentences 
sentiment recognition challenging difficult part understanding opinions 
plan extend difficult cases sentences weak opinion bearing words sentences multiple opinions topic 
improve identification holder plan parser associate regions reliably holders 
plan explore learning techniques decision lists svms 
experiments show encouraging results obtained relatively simple models small amount manual seeding effort
