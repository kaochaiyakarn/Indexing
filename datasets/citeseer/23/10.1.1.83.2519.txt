discuss difficulties encountered trying generalize formulations complex dls settle probability information theory principled 
motivation goals idea measuring concept similarity received considerable attention domains including psychology cognitive science computational linguistics information retrieval 
applied extended field information integration relies ontologies concepts described dls 
past concentrated similarity atomic concepts word senses composite defined concepts stock trade dls 
characterized difference considering nouns appearing dictionary wordnet general arbitrary noun phrases 
modest goal consider problem generalizing previous efforts define similarity primitive concepts composite ones 
review classes approaches current literature rephrase terms simple description logic try generalize complex dl 
extensions invite host new questions leave open research 
observations possible real valued function sim measure concept similarity general 
effort assess absolute numeric values ill advised small experiments human judgments shown correlate range 
target sim provide relative orderings concepts 
researchers studied complementary measure distance dist similarly ordering alternatives 
extent functions provide similar orderings consistently differing constant factor essentially indistinguishable purposes 
important general properties widely agreed desirable sim 
sim positively correlated amount commonality 
sim negatively correlated amount difference key question measure commonality turn related information concept captured 
approaches concept similarity clearly order compare concepts need consider information available 
follow rodriguez categorizing variety approaches give best known functions shall follow 
feature models approach concept characterized set features 
pioneering similarity psychologist amos tversky introduced families measures contrast model similarity linear function set difference non negative constants 
taken count features set written 
tversky proposed normalized ratio model similarity fraction involving sets def cases asymmetry similarity desired normalize things assume 
assumption distributive disjoint sets commonly written def properties sim metric contested explicitly considered 
semantic network models approach background information provided form semantic network involving concepts edges 
complex relationships considered wordnet 
similarity measures setting usually involve measuring path lengths network 
particular earliest best known proposal rada locates specific ancestor node msa defines similarity length path plus length path proposals take account depth msa order apply principle density edges nodes possibly edge weights 
information content models case available semantic network information pr probability individual described specific concept word 
probability usually estimated task specific corpus 
resnick focused msa representative similarity suggested pr better basic measure depth concept hierarchy affected changes hierarchy

consider simple case semantic net tree unique 
specifying similarity descriptions propose take simple dl involving conjunction show measures applied 
important point consider take extend approach dl generalized complex 
dl allows conjunction concepts atomic defined acyclic box expressions form 
atomic concepts possibly complex expressions named defined concepts

positive side notions lcs available arbitrary dls focus applying various measures simple atomic names 
feature models key issues counts feature valid decompositions features 
propositional dl take minimal disjunctive normal form count literals clear terms constructed roles 
example atleast atleast atleast count single feature account fact second judged similar second third 
nested role restrictions vs clearly information required concerning salience roles combine measures cases nesting produce legitimate measure feature set size similarly network measures key problem assigning useful size various concepts description 
elucidate difficulties note tried address similarity dl involving atoms conjunctions existential restrictions ae concepts converted graph metrics evaluating size lcs explored including sum length role paths number roles root number roles bearing value restrictions performed 
arbitrariness choosing size measure complex concepts appears substantial obstacle approach 
require mechanism size available pure structural form 
situations information content appears provide sensible basis size measure 
essentially wish allow ic complex concepts drive notions component salience allow laws probability domain govern combination weights proper measure size 
interestingly results exactly measures similarity certain simple cases 
order ic approach need able estimate probability pr object instance arbitrary concepts originally see atomic concepts probabilities estimated large text corpora 
complex dls obtain estimates databases semantics modeled concepts roles dl considering 
example define view database primitive role concept shows translate complex dl concept sql query qc returns tuples instances 
count tuples relative total number possible individuals yields desired statistic 
suggested alon halevy query optimizers maintain statistics database contents allow estimate query size including number tuples running query 
obtain appropriate probability estimates quite quickly 
accurate information probabilities come ontology provides kinds information 
bacchus proposed probability distribution domain interpretation semantics probability statements concerning fol formulas free variables 
classic instantiated scheme dls bayes nets provides algorithms computing pr arbitrary descriptions subset classic considers claims extensions easily complex dls 
empirical success ic similarity measures simple concepts existence theory classic indicates choices considered best solution original problem find similarity complex descriptions relies ic similarity measures backed classic ontology provides information probabilities objects satisfying properties described concepts 
applying simplifying estimates unfortunately developing full classic ontologies illustrated difficult task 
realistically existing ontologies wordnet probably annotated rough probabilistic estimates drastic assumptions independence order guide appropriate measures ic 
example suppose assume individual belongs atomic concept probability membership atomic concepts independent 

easy see pr ic log second factor treated constant

presence roles radically simplify classic consider semantics probability role having exactly fillers 
conceptually corresponds tossing coin probability heads order decide role fillers probabilities add needed 
assume individual properties role fillers independent consider description semantics individual exactly role fillers type probability pr pr sum geometric series reducing pr pr 
formula recursively compute probability ic nested descriptions estimate value pr concept pr estimated 
significant open problem research agenda information obtained available data 
model similarity approach necessarily decide questions differences concept structure impact concept similarity 
example consider series dist dist dist 
argue smaller deeply nested restrictions ought represent smaller differences 
thing varying series ic ic ic 
interestingly shown series decreases increases asymptotically depending fact single probability independent answer 
note classic valid compute pr atleast atmost product pr atleast pr atmost cases cover exclusive 
concepts need considered normal form information role single component sense structural normal form required computing similarity 
summary literally dozens proposals similarity measures tried carry program

trying find direction measuring similarity complex descriptions dls considered best known previous measures tried apply dls
