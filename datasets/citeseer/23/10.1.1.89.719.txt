background interactive environment museum visitors applied previously existing application mobile devices 
version digital museum guides developed pda platform freely available visitors museum marble located carrara italy 
provides visitors rich variety multimedia graphical video audio information regarding available artworks related items 
application location aware 
implemented number infrared beacons located entrance museum room 
composed infrared emitters generates identifier automatically detected application knows room user entering see immediately activates corresponding map vocal comments 
addition information regarding artworks sections museum application able support services showing itinerary get specific artwork current location 
information provided mainly order allow visitors freely look visual interface mainly show related videos maps different levels museum sections rooms specific pieces information 
extension developed new interaction paradigm called scan tilt 
concepts basis design came considerations derived previous experiences users visiting museum virtual digital guide 
fact virtual guide able directly interact available physical objects intrusive user experience leaving visual channel open enjoy artwork 
visitors museum interested spending time understanding electronic guide works probably visit museum 
important improve possible naturalness interaction supported guide 
addition degree freedom provided users move obtaining information want

looked exploiting rfid solutions 
composed main parts set tags radio transponders tag reader transceiver 
tags basically static identification number id store different type information sensed data environmental temperature 
reader scans available tags depending features may interrogate additional information stored embedded memory 
mobile guide small light possible opted totally handheld solution consisting compact flash cf rfid reader small sized antenna 
pda need additional expansion adapter reader plugs directly cf slot 
order fulfil requirements developed scan tilt paradigm combines multiple modalities gestures physical selection location graphical voice 
pda equipped rfid reader able read passive tags accelerometer able recognise small movements handheld device 
physical selection obtained scanning rfid tags associated artworks single handed tilt gestures control navigate user interface multimedia information 
pointing artwork interest controlling audio information small single hand gestures visual channel overloaded resulting intrusive interaction technique 
performed empirical evaluation prototype 
test showed acceptance users time highlighted limitations 
passive rfid tags prototype forced users stand close proximity artworks natural museum environments 
visitors tilting interaction technique easy especially trials 
new version overcome problem passive rfid tags active rfid tags reach larger range time provide localisation current position user forcing stand close proximity artwork 
addition planned investigate tilt modality better exploited digital museum guide accessible blind sight impaired users 
sections provide details different levels accessibility achieved exploiting features tilt modality combination vocal modality 

tilt modality gesture modality approach utilizes acceleration sensor hardware
