contextual association non interactive tables tabletop displays tendency cluttered 
multiple users contributing information displayed exacerbate problem

interaction technique support contextual association action operation effected objects operands 
readability users may interact user interface different angles sides interactive table conventional rectilinear text display necessarily readable users 
interaction technique support mechanism rotation improve readability 
concurrent interaction large direct touch surfaces user interacting applications documents objects simultaneously 
existing interaction techniques involving discrete action menus combo boxes modal dialogues consider concurrent interaction possible interference users 
user actions cause system alter display way interferes user 
interaction techniques multiuser tabletop displays minimize unpredictable scenes effects allow users control coordinated interaction
