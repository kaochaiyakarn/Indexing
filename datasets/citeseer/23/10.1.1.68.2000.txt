probabilistic relational models prm encode class level dependencies subsequently inferences particular instance class

prm learned directly relational database retaining leveraging rich structure contained 
base notation conventions prms getoor 
general prm pair defined relational schema qualitative dependency structure prm set associated parameters 
relational schema contains fundamental elements set classes 
xn set slots define relationships classes 
class composed set descriptive attributes turn take range values 
example consider schema describing domain describing votes movies 
schema classes vote person movie 
vote class single descriptive attribute score values 
person descriptive attributes age gender take values young middle aged old male female respectively single descriptive attribute rating takes values pg 
furthermore class associated set slots 

particular slot describes objects class related objects classes relational schema 
continuing example vote class associated slots vote describes objects vote describes link vote objects specific movie object 
sequence slots composed form slot chain attributes related objects denoted shorthand descriptive attribute related class 
example vote gender refers gender attribute associated 
dependency structure prm defines parents attribute parent attribute descriptive attribute class class reachable slot chain 
instance example vote score parent vote gender 
cases parent attribute take multiset values 
example discover dependency age rating movies genre 
directly model dependency user ratings movies multiset values say 
numeric attribute may choose database aggregate operator reduce multiset single value case 
reduce single value various types aggregation functions

experimental design main challenges designing experiment test predictive accuracy prm model avoiding resubstitution error 
prm learned entire eachmovie database subsequently predictions objects database data testing training 
standard learning paradigm typically splits data subsets trains data test remaining subset 
simple approach apply trivial divide data independent compartments movies people intertwined address issue applying modified crossvalidation procedure dataset 
traditional method dividing data cross validation folds applied directly relational database extend basic idea relational setting follows 
fold cross validation create new datasets 
dn eachmovie data schema 
iterate objects person table randomly allocate individual di 
dn 
add objects linked individual objects linked ote objects di 
procedure complete creates datasets 
example eachmovie dataset algorithm absolute deviation cr bc bn prm table 
absolute deviation scoring results eachmovie dataset non active votes breese roughly balanced properties terms number individuals number votes person experiments fold cross validation 

evaluation criteria adopt absolute deviation metric miller breese assess quality recommendation algorithms 
divide data training test set method described build prm resp training data 
iterate user test set allowing user active user 
active user iterate set votes pa allowing vote active vote remaining votes prm model 
pa denote predicted vote active user movie va denote actual vote 
average absolute deviation ma vote predictions sa pa va ma pa absolute deviation dataset average score users test set users 
algorithm absolute deviation cr bc bn table 
absolute deviation scoring results eachmovie dataset votes breese 
standard prms experiments able achieve absolute deviation error 
comparison table includes results breese correlation cr bayesian clustering bc bayesian network model bn vector similarity
