arp multihop wireless networks bsd implementation arp designed wired networks arp protocol run largely lan environments chances losing arp requests replies small 
arp table entries modified arp reply packets sent response arp query packets 
node arp buffer holds packet destination arp resolution progress 
packet arrives destination address resolved earlier packet dropped buffer 
arp completely stateless retransmit arp requests triggered fresh packet 
ns implements bsd arp 
wireless networks arp packets easily lost collisions arp resolution problems lead loss data packets 
manets problem particularly severe 
instance aodv routing protocol uses unicast route reply rrep packets destination source create route 
hop rrep involve arp resolution 
single arp request reply lost rrep reach source 
observed event quite common affects routing performance significantly 
address resolution required frequently manet mobility causes frequent changes node neighbors
