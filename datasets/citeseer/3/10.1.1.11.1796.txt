peer capable describing relevant features query capabilities export scheme classification peer id quality services metadata model

deriving dimensions subsequently metadata model describes peer usually done semiautomatically presents approaches obtaining information peer quality automatically 
aim socs clustering community relevant documents 
documents usually classified taxonomies community 
rely classification peers domain specific taxonomies classification documents stored peer 
taxonomies classification established agreed respective community 
examples taxonomies acm computer science classification acm ccs software engineering book knowledge classification 
order capture classifications define attributes 
attribute contains url recognized taxonomy user defined taxonomy 
attribute represents entry classification path general specific entry classification 
attributes determine peers right content particular query 
determine peers right interface answer specific query introduce second dimension query capabilities peer set queries supported peer 
elements query matched schema information attributes particular information provider peer order determine respective peer able answer query 
positive match context states peer understands able answer specific query guarantee non empty answer set 
note generally schema networks query capabilities described schemas rdf schema xml schema different granularities :10.1.1.11.4740
