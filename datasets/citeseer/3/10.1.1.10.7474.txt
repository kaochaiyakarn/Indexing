interval processing bilvideo query model intervals categorized types non atomic atomic intervals 
condition holds frame part video clip interval representing answer condition considered nonatomic interval 
non atomicity implies frame interval question condition hold 
condition holds subinterval non atomic interval 
implication correct atomic intervals
