identifying boundaries portuguese web web designed break geographical barriers information available world wide independently physical location pages find subsets pages related country common country code top level domain language spoken country isn definition country web hard come precise definition sites constitute country web 
define portuguese web set documents contain information related portugal major interested portuguese people 
practice consider documents satisfy conditions hosted site pt domain hosted site com net org tv domains written portuguese incoming link originated web page hosted pt domain 
definition aims easily set crawling policy guarantee crawler downloads documents belong high probability portuguese web 
objective condition collect documents hosted correspondent portugal 
second condition motivated increasing number portuguese sites registered outside pt domain 
approach establishing boundary portuguese web harvest documents written portuguese language outside pt domain 
require downloading large number pages specially brazil information highly related portugal 
definition adopted mitigates problem remains brazilian sites hosted allowed domains com 
alternative approach find sites related country outside include sites physically hosted country whois database 
companies provide hosting services support distinct sites machine whois registries keep information ip address sub networks web sites hosted
