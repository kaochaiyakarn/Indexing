eliminates need generating subsequences stored se quence subsequence matching 
improve search efficiency selects subset features greatest discriminating capability features largest filtering effect perform matching correlating 
small fraction sequences ex pected pass test 
discriminating set features matching 
process iterated features exhausted 
compared method proposed performs hierar scan tree structure indexing 
different transformations considered 
approach introduced determine similar sequences set sequences 
applicable find subsequences similar target sequence 
similarity measure considered euclidean distance sequences matching performed time domain 
tree type index maintained subsequences length say 
matching similar sequences consists steps 
step matching pairs subsequences length identified tree type index 
second step pair sequences matching pairs step stitched long subsequence matches 
third step linearly long subsequence matches second step determine longest match length 
approach allows amplitude se quences scaled offset adjusted properly 
permits gaps matching subsequences 
mining path traversal patterns distributed information providing environment docu ments objects usually linked facilitate interactive access 
examples information providing environments include world wide web www line services prodigy amer ica online users seeking information interest travel object corre sponding facilities hyperlinks url addresses provided 
clearly understanding user access patterns environments help improving system design providing efficient access highly cor related objects better authoring design pages able lead better marketing decisions put ting advertisements proper places better customer user classification behavior analysis 
capturing user access patterns environments referred min ing path traversal patterns 
note efforts elaborated analyzing user behavior mining path traversal patterns infancy 
part explained reason information providing services great potential infancy customer analysis may remain coarser level fre quency page visited user occupation age study 
note pointed users traveling information providing services search desired information objects visited 
locations content showing difference traversal pattern problem oth ers mainly customer transactions 
unique feature traversal pattern problem bly increases difficulty extracting meaningful infor mation sequence traversal data explains reason current web usage analysis products able provide statistical information traveling points traveling paths 
informa tion providing services increasingly popular nowadays growing demand capturing user ieee transactions knowledge data engineering vol 
december traveling services 
behavior improving quality response demand problem mining traversal patterns explored proposed solution procedure consists steps 
algorithm devised convert original sequence log data set traversal subsequences 
traversal subsequence represents maximal forward starting point user access 
noted step converting original log sequence set maximal forward filter effect backward mainly ease traveling enable concentrate mining meaningful user access sequences 
second algorithms determine frequent traversal patterns termed large sequences maximal forward obtained developed large sequence sequence appeared sufficient number times database 
example suppose traversal log contains traversal path user vi shown fig 

set maximal forward refer ences user abcd 
maximal forward users obtained problem finding frequent traversal patterns mapped finding frequent occurring con subsequences maximal forward refer ences 
large sequences determined maximal sequences obtained straightforward manner 
maximal sequence large sequence contained maximal sequence 
suppose ab ad cg gh bg set large abe cgh set large 
resulting maximal sequences ad bg abe cgh 
maximal sequence corresponds frequently accessed pattern information providing service 
noted problem finding large se quences similar finding large itemsets asso ciation rules large itemset set items ap sufficient number transactions :10.1.1.40.6984
different se quence mining traversal patterns consecutive maximal forward large itemset mining association rules just combination items transaction 
consequence differ ence problems calls differ ent algorithms mining knowledge required 
popularity internet explodes nowadays expected effectively discover knowledge web important data mining issues years come
