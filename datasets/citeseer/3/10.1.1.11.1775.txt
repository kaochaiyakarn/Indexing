location normalization different general wsd selection restriction wsd cases sufficient distinguish correct sense candidates 
example sentence white house located washington selection restriction collocation located determine washington location name sufficient decide actual sense location

example pattern city determine sense tags cases new york city pattern candidate city name comma candidate state name disambiguate cases albany new york shanghai illinois 
absence patterns occurring location nes discourse provide evidence predicting probable sense location name 
specifically location normalization depends occurrence constraints geographically related location entities mentioned document
