prime concern tcp congestion 
congestion occurs routers overloaded traffic causes queues build eventually overflow leading high delays packet losses 
internet traffic carried extremely reliable wired links tcp assumes losses indicate congestion 
losses detected retransmitting lost packet tcp reduces transmission rate allowing router queues drain 
subsequently gradually increases transmission rate gently probe network capacity 
tcp maintains congestion window estimate number packets transit causing congestion

congestion window starts packet new acknowledgments causing incremented doubling rtt 
slow start phase exponential increase 
slow start stops rtts loss detected timeout 
slow start threshold set half value congestion window congestion window reset packet lost packet retransmitted 
slow start repeated threshold reached rtts allowing routers drain queues 
subsequently congestion window incremented packet rtt 
congestion avoidance phase linear increase 
losses detected duplicate acknowledgments indicating subsequent packets received tcp retransmits lost packet halves congestion window restarts congestion avoidance phase

tcp performance enhancements transport layer solutions degraded performance tcp wireless links due wireless losses congestion 
numerous proposals appropriate tcp modifications exist

sender freezes pending timers starts periodically probing receiver window 
shrinking advertised window violates tcp guidelines 
handoffs congestion avoidance helps probe capacity new link

snoop tracks tcp data acknowledgments maintaining state tcp connection traversing pivot point 
snoop caches unacknowledged tcp packets uses loss indications conveyed duplicate acknowledgments plus local timers transparently retransmit lost data 
hides duplicate acknowledgments indicating wireless losses tcp sender preventing redundant tcp recovery 
snoop exploits information tcp packets avoid link layer control overhead 
outperforms split tcp schemes violating tcp semantics 
avoids conflicting local tcp retransmissions suppressing duplicate tcp acknowledgments 
snoop requires tcp receiver located right pivot point

situation explicit loss notification eln needed tcp distinguish congestion wireless losses 
snoop agent detects non congestion related loss sets eln bit tcp headers propagates receiver echoes back sender 
snoop queue length information heuristically distinguish congestion wireless errors
