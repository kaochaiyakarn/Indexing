jonathan guido governatori giovanni sartor empowerment autonomous agents corresponds needs society possible establish advance normative relations agents left agents decide normative relations required fulfillment tasks 
law normative self organization typically happens contracts contract declarative act jointly performed parties status going changed declaration performing 
example italian civil code art establishes contract agreement parties create regulate extinguish legal relationship 
means parties create legal positions duties powers rights extinguish transfer property rights party 
note law establish changes contract legal positions parties establish changes law principle recognise producing results parties state contractual terms law integrate modify results 
explains contracts usually exhaustively classified types acts theories institutional acts usually distinguish commands single contract usually establishes new normative positions 
fact contracts put focus new dimension autonomy private contractual autonomy means possibility realizing legal effects parties wish just stating effects 
agent empowered type statements just described may condition directly exercising power 
need impose regulation autonomous agent able delegate agents exercise powers 
autonomy enhanced instrument representation basically concerns situation principal held declarations especially contracts behalf 
essential aspect representation authority power representative declarations directly bind principal count principal declarations 
cases subject confers representation accompanying mandate obligation exercising certain way power representation 
idea mandate concerns situation agent commands agent account 
usually mandate presupposes authority contract signed execution specific business 
requests generate duty act way requested order achieve goals 
connections declarative power representation mandate notion declarative power basic 
representation usually created exercise power mandate 
additionally uncommon representation mandate go principal confers agent power represent usually principal binds agent acts certain ways legal relation providing background exercise representation 
possible representation mandate agent power act name principal obligation 
american restatement law affirms essential existence authority contract principal agent agent promise undertake act agent 
consider situation person confers relative power representing sale house 
relative may obliged principal exercise power assume tells time go declarative power representation mandate 
formal analysis sell house name undertake obligation doing 
may just permitted relies accomplishing task 
usually accompanies representation power representative duty exercise power decides satisfy interest principal see italian civil code art 

representation exists representative acts interest principal 
abuse representation contract concluded representative binds principal contract knew known representative acting duty assigned principal 
representative may obliged compensate principal losses incurred abuse 
situation representative acts duties may principal act power distinguished situation representative lacks power representation acts power 
case contract generally effective regard person name representative acting 
important aspect representation representative limit contribution transmission declaration prepared principal advance 
usually contrary principal elects representative know best handle business representative circumstance business take place 
representative decides perform transaction name principal representative decision contractual declaration expresses intention determined goals beliefs 
words specific conditions predetermined principal transaction decided representative

institution provides effectiveness say subject declarative power ow corresponds accepting true 
agent declarative power producing means produces empowering autonomous agents fundamental aspect norm governed society consists permissions obligations members 
autonomous society agents able creating permissions obligations 
decisive aspect autonomous social organization consists empowerment agents establishing agents may create normative relations 
model agents empowered attributing declarative powers 
enables agents create normative relations ordinate behaviours 
failure provide viable allocation powers may threaten survival society 
example self interested agents unlimited power unilaterally create obligation head agents society soon collapse everybody soon covered workload obligations longer fulfilled conflicts explode trust fade away 
sketch features viable allocation powers gives agent maximum power consistent attribution power agents 
multi lateral contracts declarative power may jointly exercised party 
action performed set agents 
general terms may call action contract 
example making contract takes obligation provide piece music undertakes obligation pay price represented proc oke deliver pay joint usually performed acts called offer second acceptance 
combination considered joint declaration notice reading different proposed krogh 
view contract relation follows 
conjunct ought statement expressing obligation second corresponds ought statement saying requires perform think approach intuitively unsatisfactory lacks explicit strong logical relation conjuncts 
solve problem saying conjunction directed obligations jointly parties

words empower agents effective promises consent 
empowerment obligations give permissions reasonable assign agent power freeing agent obligations consent 
example longer interested performance allowed free performance 
fact able look obligation originally created promote interest empowered choose cancel obligation ow ow oj jonathan guido governatori giovanni sartor accordingly formula enables agent give permission

approach appropriate autonomous agents commercial domain 
empowerment command unreasonable give agents power commanding action agent 
power commanding needs restricted specific cases agent hierarchically superior 
power commanding held superiors conferred rule superior ow note types societies restriction opportune boss total dictator subordinates 
total power commanding may right empowerment human user agents 
empowerment power may reasonable give agents power powers 
general terms expressed general empowerment ow ow empowerment empower give agents chance develop societal relationships give power conferring power

mandate puts obligation principles sketched effective mandate presupposes power commanding expressed contract concluded
