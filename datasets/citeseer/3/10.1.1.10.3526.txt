grid project developing high level service middleware support construction www mygrid org uk management sharing data intensive silico experiments biology 
generation production provenance data seen central requirement grid project 
generating provenance grid grid want generate exploit provenance intended machine consumption 
large amount provenance data required allow scientists verify experiments means collection possible automatically systematically generated 
considerable potential programs process collections provenance records provide users higher level views happened virtual organisation 
major forms provenance derivation path records process results generated input data 
include database query program parameters workflow number services 
knowledge derivation path essential effective change management knowing experiment needs re run light new information 
second annotations attached objects collections objects 
standard annotations object created updated owns format 
addition annotations describe object concepts related scientific domain 
example database entry protein sequence fasta format describes enzyme glucose substrate kinase function 
annotations add context information essential interpretation raw scientific data 
workflows represent silico experiments grid describe orchestration bioinformatics data analysis services derive outputs
