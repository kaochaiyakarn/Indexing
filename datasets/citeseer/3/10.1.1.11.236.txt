starting cspray cspray may started standalone collaborative mode 
standalone mode cspray behaves single user application spray 
collaborative mode cspray passes relevant information participants maintains dynamic list active participants 
spray cans permissions spray cans contain associated data streams 
participants may allowed indirect access local data avos generated spray cans 
accommodate participants wish limit access local data differentiate private public spray cans 
private default 
creator decides public avos visible participants 
participants take turn grab manipulate spray 
deletion public cans allowed creator owner data stream tied spray 
user shelf spray cans consists private collection common public collection 
public spray translated requests host machine owns generate send appropriate avos 
possible spray multiple data streams different hosts 
case implies requests remote hosts access different data streams 
cspray additional public type remote cursor 
pointer indicates interesting features person shared workspace 
pointer cans resemble spray cans input stream 
floor control objects public may potentially grabbed participant 
floor control means regulating control public object necessary avoid contention 
cspray public spray cans pointer cans examples public objects

changing views simply matter changing stream connections 
public window commonly briefing mode 
group attention focused single presenter view actions

presenter may wish select name views menu allowing observe viewing public view 
view useful presenter visually confirms objects public visible private invisible 
participants know want show public window available audio tools vat limiting network traffic visual clutter permission allows prevents members window

default private cans send orientation movements avos participants private public windows public cans send information windows 
currently cspray allows local user toggle viewing private public avos 
provides quick way reduce clutter workspace 
networked environment different levels service participant may particularly slow node 
users may toggle avos users improve interaction time 
built flow control varying rendering update rates match participants capacities 
sharing cspray allows participants create visualization products data sharing 
happens data level avo level image level 
permissions allow optimizations may take place transparent application 
data streams access remote file database access 
stream connections clients sufficient network bandwidth 
data replication different sites provides higher interactive performance initial data transfer 
data private constantly changing raw data distributed avos shared 
number avos quite large newly created avos broadcasted 
addition different levels rendering network capabilities require applications adjust interactive performance switching sending avos sending rendered images 
users grab cans simply getting rendered images opposed list avos replicated data streams 
joining leaving session participants join session time 
joins occur current state avos users viewpoints public spray cans stream attachments transferred new participant 
information new participant announced session members 
cspray supports functions bringing late date occured 
participants may join session fully active contributing member passive observer 
just users may join time may leave time 
leaving session requires coordination cspray clients data sets cans controlled users giving floor control objects 
design implementation cspray session management floor control functions implemented application making 
architecture cspray cspray uses symmetrical client server collaboration model 
collaborative host runs local copy cspray 
bsd berkeley software distribution unix sockets network communication 
sockets opened collaborator 
reliable tcp ip transmission control protocol internet protocol socket control information socket transmission data positional update events 
comparably equipped collaborators cspray transmits geometric data avo participants 
method machine power process data display images strict client server model 
sending avos collaborators able keep individual data private 
allows scientists share results visualizations granting full access raw data 
data need exist collaborating host concern tracking updates multiple copies data files 
framebuffer data transmission method benefit model allows participant view data independently perspective requesting additional information host data stored 
possible view independent avos resides host 
transmitting participant view matrix views shared participants 
framebuffer method require compressing transmitting entire framebuffer floating point value view matrix 
course frame clients workstations stations insufficient rendering speed 
session management cspray provides limited session management supports late maintains session list explicitly 
done linked list data structure called collab list maintains list users session 
record collab list contains collaborator name process identifier host name viewing location viewing orientation 
information allow cspray uniquely identify participant session 
identification contained packet transmitted necessary events received determine sent event 
viewing information determine locations participant wishes track participant view 
floor control cspray floor management locally static ownership example spray resides machine created 
alternatively participants grab floor spray move manipulate distributed 
floor manager knows broadcast messages participants permission receive data 
distinguish floor manager floor controller 
manager creates shared objects holds data 
control temporarily granted connected collaborator requests public data 
default controller manager 
shared object point time manager controller requests floor controller maintains floor requested timer elapsed 
having host manages cans version cspray manage set cans 
distributed floor management scheme avoids consulting central host floor control transaction 
believe distributed control provides greater scalability fault tolerance distributes network traffic floor control responsibilities 
shows flow diagram floor manager scheme cspray 
streams events events cspray handled message passing paradigm messages distributed various modules local host sent received collaborating remote versions 
treat sequence events streams handles cspray controls redirects requirement classification event 
events may local non collaborative may collaborative 
type may may require floor control 
collaborative events requiring floor control include public resources public spray cans pointers 
changes eye point location generates collaborative event require floor control force move 
collaborative new location broadcast participants locations updated

cspray provides support collaborations avos supports new collaborative interactive objects shareable spray cans name labels intuitive floor control protocol exchanging packets describing objects movement 
summary design issues identified components integrated collaborative scientific visualization software application 
participants cspray collaborate interactively create visualization products 
cspray new visualization collaboration features allowing scientists indirectly share data maintain exclusivity recording session activities playback review providing clear handles spray cans aware interacting remote users independent audio video tools 
cspray collaboration aware implementation permissions enforced different levels sharing 
additional enhancements currently development include matching service levels client resources compression visualization streams porting avo handling routines opengl non sgi platforms supporting clients hardware rendering
