controlled fuzzy cognitive maps directed graphs nodes represent fuzzy concepts arcs represent fuzzy rules causal flow concepts 
node fcm activation levels input arcs summed give activation 
simulate entire worlds control behaviour intelligent agents 
implementation created fcm system uses range different fuzzy node types concepts motivations rules actions 
sample shown 
node shapes indicate types arc labelled indicate arc results causal increase decrease 
role simply collection fcm objects adopting role involves adding objects character fcm 
simulation proceeds repeatedly perform action highest activation 
performing action result reducing activation action node allows actions take place 
main advantage role passing offers simple efficient technique control agents move situations 
allow believable agent behaviour assuming discarding roles required making decisions issues unrelated agent current situation taken account reducing processing load 
role passing populating virtual world agents straightforward process 
placing agents novel situations involves simply defining new roles easing complications involved attempting design general agents 
furthermore designing role involves simply drawing fcm possible amenable game designers writing script plans
