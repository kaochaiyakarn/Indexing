lsd matches learn models elements mediated schema 
single learning algorithm captures cues domain multi strategy approach combined predictions learners 
asked lsd predict matches mediated schema set test schemas 
experiments showed possible achieve high accuracy multi strategy learning additional accuracy obtained considering domain constraints simple form domain knowledge 
lsd achieved matching accuracy small medium sized schemas data sources web 
extended lsd consider simple taxonomies concepts doan

cost constructing knowledge bases wide domain coverage prohibitive 
creating querying structured knowledge greatest impediments database knowledge base technology conceptual difficulty dealing structured data versus unstructured text called structure chasm halevy 
known creating domain models database schema knowledge bases conceptual effort 
querying requires different kind effort understanding domain model 
significant challenge kr database communities create tools facilitate creation querying structured data 
halevy argues corpus schemas enables building tools purpose 
tool schema design advisor assists authoring structured data spirit auto complete feature 
user tool creates schema fragment data particular domain tool proposes extensions schema corpus 
user may choose schema list modify fit local context 
note time savings tool advantages possibly resulting better designs helping users conform factual queries web query answering similarity queries statistics corpus schema authoring applications interfaces corpus representation system contains large collection disparate domain models instance data validated mappings domain models meta data 
applications access corpus statistics computed set interfaces 
interfaces support different types factual queries similarity queries 
certain standards applicable 
imagine corpus representation phase verifying correctness knowledge base 
corpus representation aid creating traditional knowledge systems 
querying side corpus representation facilitate querying unfamiliar data 
specifically consider tool enables pose query terminology database 
tool corpus propose reformulations query formed schemas database hand 
tool may propose queries possibly example answers choose refine 
general properties candidate applications exact characterization applications lend corpus representation subject research

fact include data sets schema certain file formats 
note case elements schema model may instance data model 
distinction schema instance data clean cut 

validated mappings mappings directly pairs domain models go intermediate domain model madhavan 

queries queries posed users applications provide important information certain data 
example database query performs join attributes different tables indicates columns modeling domain evident schema specifies data type 

meta data forms meta data accompany domain models 
range text descriptions meaning different fields statistics table cardinalities histograms set possible values column 
important emphasize corpus logically coherent universal database 
collection disparate structures relatively little control logical design elements corpus 
expect domain model information corpus stored accessed tools model management bernstein attempt provide set operators manipulating models data opposed data 
statistics corpus plethora possible analyses performed corpus finding effective ones long term research challenge 
describe certain kinds statistics computed corpus 
classify apply individual words terms partial structures elements particular schemas 
word term statistics statistics associated individual words language noun verb phrases 
statistics indicate word different roles structured data 
statistics maintain different versions depending take consideration word stemming synonym tables inter language dictionaries combination 
statistics include 
term usage frequently term relation name attribute name data percent uses percent structures corpus 

occurring schema elements different uses term relation names attributes tend appear 
tend names related tables attribute names 
tend join predicates pairs tables 
clusters attribute names appear conjunction 
mutually exclusive uses attribute names 

similar names uses term words tend similar statistical characteristics 
composite statistics statistics applied partial structures 
examples partial structures sets data instances relations associated attribute names relation data possibly missing values 
clearly need significantly limit number partial structures keep statistics techniques discovering partial structures occur frequently 
statistics certain partial structures estimate statistics related structures 
statistics schema elements word different structures different meanings 
may want characterize specific usages terms structures relate usage terms structures 
example madhavan learn classifier relation attribute name corpus 
doan meta strategy learning 
training data learning gleaned schema element belongs training data elements mapped validated mapping corpus 
intuitively classifier meant recognize particular usage term appears differently structure 
application interfaces corpus applications built corpus able access directly statistics computed corpus perform obvious lookups queries corpus 
addition just knowledge systems provide set higher level interfaces spirit chaudhri done corpus representation systems 
examples functions interface support 
note implementation interfaces poses research challenges 
classify interfaces ask factual queries similarity queries 
cases expect answers returned ranked list answers 
addition traditional knowledge bases able obtain explanation answers 
notation variables 
factual information simplest case query nonground formula corpus return possible formula 
simple example ask values killed elvis 
different example higher order query find toyota honda 
complicated function take input set constants return formulas include constants 
goal find terms re lated specifying exactly role play formula 
example input may answers gpa value student gpa address 
note terms play different roles answers answers templates formulas schema description particular sets formulas 
cases complement query background knowledge 
knowledge may eliminate answers result different ranking answers 
similarity information key imports corpus contains different ways saying similar facts 
similarity queries try get different perspectives 
simplest case query ground fact corpus return similar ways saying thing 
example input class luxury output toyota car review 
complex case query consist terms answer sets facts terms tend play similar roles 
example input review referee answer reviewer accept referees round reviewer reject 
answer specify terms differently soccer game reviewing movie 
summary note fundamental challenges building interface corpus 
logical knowledge databases answers ranked defining boolean condition data 
second interested similarity querying looking different ways saying thing third answers returned summarize sets facts describe schema fragments
