section briefly discuss related 
concepts linguistic annotation process result manually adding new information existing language data 
existing data consist written texts newspaper corpus spoken language may multi modal contain pointing gestures

approach written text simply modelled sequence sentence elements spans number word elements 
spoken language dialogues sequences turn elements spans sequences word elements tokenization words segmentation sentences turns performed mere formal surface level believe elements sufficiently objective serve structure call annotation base data

relations markables attributes sufficient add information independent sequences base data elements relate expression structural information 
approach complemented means express relations markables 
currently attributes type member relation pointer relation supported 
attributes type member relation express undirected relations arbitrary markables 
relation interpreted set membership markables having value attribute type member relation constitute unordered set 
attributes type pointer relation hand express directed relations single source markables arbitrarily target markables 
name suggests relation interpreted source markable pointing target markable 
important note member relation pointer relation attributes 
types attributes nominal realized attributes arbitrary names 
means markable different attributes type member defined annotation scheme 
attribute type simply defines attributes interpreted 
concept markable relations defined formally semantic interpretation 
markables relations associated kind semantic interpretation depending annotation task hand coreference annotation natural member relation attribute coref class model classes expressions 
addition binary pointer relation attribute antecedent employed annotate direct antecedent expression 
example task annotating predicate argument structure verbs binary pointer relation attributes subject direct object indirect object link verb arguments 
xml level relations expressed normal attributes difference values lists markable element ids strings form set 
markable id markable span word coref class set antecedent markable 
annotation schemes linguistic level attribute relation applicable time kind markable 
coreference annotation markable explicitly annotated discourse initial allowed antecedent attribute 
lines predicate argument structure annotation called weather verb rain allowed pointer subject 
restricting availability attributes sense particular situation important means ensure annotation quality consistency 
dependencies kind best captured formulating constraints attributes occur mutually exclusive 
approach constraints various types modelled annotation scheme

annotation scheme defines attributes nominal member relation pointer relation valid linguistic level 
specifies possible values nominal attributes identifies default attribute values 
attributes branching non branching attribute branching current value influences attributes available 
branching nominal attribute possible values associated attributes 
branching member relation attribute hand attributes possible depending attribute value 
consider example see illustration dealing pronoun resolution spoken dialogue strube ller different types expressions noun phrases verb phrases utterances disfluencies annotated

section deals concepts lend simultaneous representation multiple levels linguistic description

similar lines prosody intonation level provide relevant information 
tempting merge markable files different levels serious disadvantages 
subsequent modification removal level cumbersome 
alternative versions level utterance segmentations performed different annotators easily compared having duplicate levels 
reasons approach favours separation different description levels different markables files 
markables define directly embedded base data base data elements means span attribute simultaneous application description levels straightforward annotation base data set sets markables pertaining different description levels simply applied allowed access base data elements adding level level annotation 
markables different levels related indirectly virtue shared base data elements issues overlap discontinuous elements arise
