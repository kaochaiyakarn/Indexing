example bilateral bargaining model bosch bosch considers bargaining model buyers sellers bargain prices trade 
link necessary buyer seller transaction occur player links possibilities transact 
network structure essentially determines bargaining power various buyers sellers 
specifically seller single unit indivisible sell value seller 
buyers valuation single unit 
buyer seller exchange price buyer receives payoff seller payoff link network represents opportunity buyer seller bargain potentially exchange 
bosch models bargaining variation rubinstein bargaining protocol 
period sellers simultaneously call price 
buyer select fromthe prices heard called sellers linked 
buyers simultaneously respond choosing accept single price offer received reject price offers received 
sellers called price buyers accepted price discretion network connections trades occur careful protocol determining trades occur essentially designed maximize number eventual transactions 
period trades buyers sellers traded cleared fromthe market 
period situation reverses buyers call prices 
accepted rejected sellers connected way described 
period role proposer responder switches process repeats indefinitely remaining buyers sellers linked 
buyers sellers impatient discount common discount factor 
transaction price period worth seller buyer 
note bosch framework links form buyers sellers 
fits setting considering links form players simply having value function allocation rule ignore links buyers sellers 
specification specification costs links calculate expected payoff buyer seller allocation rule function network structure 
example model buyer seller networks model buyer seller networks similar bosch model described valuations buyers random determination prices auction alternating offers bargaining 
model described follows 
seller indivisible object sale 
buyers independently identically distributed utilities object denoted ui 
buyer knows valuation distribution buyers valuations similarly sellers know distribution buyers valuations 
link patterns represent potential transactions transactions prices determined auction bargaining 
particular prices rise simultaneously sellers 
buyers drop price exceeds valuation english ascending oral auction 
buyers drop emerge sets sellers remaining buyers linked sellers larger set sellers 
sellers transact buyers linked 
exact matching trades link pattern done carefully maximize number transactions 
sellers buyers cleared market prices continue rise remaining sellers process repeats 
link pattern player defined expected payoff fromthe described process ex ante perspective buyers know ui 
expected payoff deducted costs maintaining links buyers sellers obtain prediction net payoffs function network structure words allocation rule 
example buyer seller networks quality differentiated products wang watts wang watts model buyer seller networks enriches bargaining models ways 
sellers choice selling goods high low quality observable buyer 
addition having links buyers sellers buyers sellers may link form buyers associations sellers associations 
advantage forming associations influence bargaining power eventual prices emerge

proposition satisfies component balance equal bargaining power mv component additive dutta mutuswami extend characterization allow weighted bargaining power show obtains version weighted shapley myerson value 
myerson value interesting allocation rule perspective takes problematic network formation perspective 
basic value possible networks properly accounted calculations 
especially situations network changed formed 
basic idea follows 
network changed alternative possible network structures taken account bargaining allocate value values alternative networks just sub networks important determining allocation 
see jackson detailed discussion 
network completely fixed changed clear value sub networks sub networks enter allocation calculations 
criticisms precise looking simple examples 
example criticism myerson value consider value function networks 
case network nonempty subnetworks generate value 
consider value function defined 
value non empty network 
note mv mv myerson value allocation rule provides allocation network regardless value function particular player gets bigger allocation network players 
reflects player status links network comes shapley value style calculations underlying myerson value think building network adding players time 
player position special network player status special value function player equally served central position 
fact non empty network provide 
extent network altered reason player enjoy special treatment argue players receive equal payments 
see issues detail look conditions characterize myerson value 
example criticism equal bargaining power andv networks 
single link network involves player generate value networks generate value 
allocation rule including myerson value satisfies equal bargaining power allocates players empty network 
networks real asymmetry players player critical player 
clear require allocation players network player viable outside option player 
criticisms including pointing problems component balance 
response criticisms jackson proposes allocation rule 
auxiliary definition needed 
value function cover defined max 
monotonic cover value function looks highest value achieved building network set links 
monotonic cover captures perspective network flexible reorganized produce highest possible value 
perspective leads natural adaptation shapley value network games results allocation rule jackson called player flexible network allocation rule 
instance brings core considerations fact full value player example 
jackson proposes allocation rules 
slight variation 
allocation rule looks value group players generate forming best possible network 
shapley style calculations looks marginal value generated adding player different groups allocation proportion marginal contributions 
superficial level rule bears similarities myerson value see shapley value style calculations 
quite different allocation rule 
fact violates equal bargaining power component balance characterized conditions violated myerson value 
instance looking back example provides allocations differ fact agrees myerson value contrast fully egalitarian example provides higher allocations player contrast myerson value 
generally takes perspective alternative network structures matter determining allocation variety cooperative game theoretic solutions concepts including example called addition shapley value 
simple idea monotonic cover define cooperative game basis allocating value 
concluding discussion directed networks survey focussed case non directed networks 
specifically important aspect treatment situations link players requires consent parties 
non directed mutual consent link
