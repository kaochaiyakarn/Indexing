mapping immunology computation natural immune systems consist different kinds cells molecules lymphocytes lymphocytes dendritic cells natural killer cells mast cells 
components identified studied experimentally understood role play immune response 
ais simplify introducing basic type detector cell combines useful properties different immune cells 
detector cell different possible states roughly corresponding immature lymphocytes undergoing negative selection thymus naive lymphocytes matched foreign material memory lymphocytes long lived easily stimulated 
natural immune system different types effector cells implement different immune responses mast cell response currently include model 
detector cell represented single bit string length bits small amount state see 
effect representing receptor region surface lymphocyte 
region binds foreign material process call recognition 
ways implementing detectors example detector production rule neural network agent 
chose implement detection binding string matching detector string detection string occurs match matching rule 
string matching simple efficient implement easy analyze understand 
obvious matching rules include hamming distance edit distance adopted plausible rule called contiguous bits 
strings match contiguous bits rule symbols contiguous bit positions 
value threshold determines specificity detector indication number strings covered single detector 
example matching completely specific detector detect single string recall length detector bit string 
consequence partial matching rule threshold contiguous bits trade number detectors specificity specificity detectors increases number detectors required achieve certain level coverage increases 
detectors grouped sets set machine host lan host loosely corresponds different location body broadcast assumption detector set constantly exposed current set connections lan uses dynamic definition self observed connections fixed time period analogous set proteins expressed thymus period time

system detectors remain location lifetime 
internal host broadcast lan external host ip port datapath triple ftp ip port detector set new detectors created randomly asynchronously continual schedule similar natural immune system 
new detectors remain immature period time opportunity match current network connections 
detector matches immature killed deleted 
process called negative selection closely resembles negative selection immature lymphocytes thymus 
potential problem scheme nonself packet arriving negative selection cause immature detectors erroneously eliminated 
assume nonself packets rare reasonable assumption mature detectors detect foreign packet 
small loss efficiency needlessly deleting valid detector appreciable loss function 
detectors survive initial testing phase promoted mature detectors analogous mature lymphocytes leaving thymus mature leaving bone marrow 
mature detector valid detector acts independently 
mature detector matches sufficient number packets see activation threshold alarm raised 
time naive lymphocyte thought learning phase 
learning phase activation threshold level permutation mask detector host architecture ais 
detector set immature memory activated matches failed match packet deleted matched sufficient number nonself packets memory detector greatly extended lifetime 
memory detectors lower threshold activation see implementing secondary response sensitive responds aggressively naive detectors previously seen strings 
memory detectors desirable large fraction naive detectors naive detectors necessary detection novel foreign packets essential anomaly detection 
incomplete self sets natural immune system ais face problem incomplete self sets lymphocytes undergo negative selection thymus exposed proteins body 
consequently negative selection process incomplete sense lymphocyte survive negative selection reactive legitimate self protein thymus potentially leading auto immune reaction 
ais reaction called false positive 
false positives arise train system incomplete description self encounter new legitimate patterns 
system tolerant minor mate new patterns detect abnormal activity implemented methods designed overcome problem activation thresholds adaptive thresholds 
activation thresholds similar function thresholds lymphocytes 
lymphocyte covered identical receptors activated sufficiently receptors bound pathogens threshold binding exceeded 
analogously detector ais match multiple times activated 
detector records number times matches raises alarm number matches exceeds activation threshold stored locally detector set 
detector raised alarm returns match count zero 
mechanism time horizon time count matches slowly returns zero 
repeated occurrences structurally similar temporally clumped strings trigger detection system 
attacks may launched different machines case method successful 
detect distributed coordinated attacks introduce second method called adaptive activation labeled level 
match count detector goes local activation threshold reduced 
different detector matches time detection system detectors machine easily activated 
mechanism time horizon time activation threshold gradually returns default value 
method detect diverse activity different sources provided activity happens certain period time 
mechanism roughly captures role cytokines molecules play increasing decreasing sensitivity individual immune system lymphocytes physically local region 
learning mechanisms negative selection maturation naive cells memory cells simple learning mechanisms immune system 
third form immune system learning resembles genetic algorithm crossover incorporated model affinity maturation 
simple form detectors compete foreign packets just lymphocytes compete bind foreign antigen 
case detectors simultaneously match packet closest match greatest fitness wins 
introduces pressure specific matching system causing system discriminate precisely self nonself 
propose implemented successful detectors bind foreign packets undergo proliferation making copies migrating computers somatic copying high mutation rate 
concept second signal known stimulation explain certain immunological responses 
example second signal helper lymphocyte 
lymphocyte possibly mutated descendant earlier lymphocyte survived negative selection binds foreign peptide signal requires helper lymphocyte censored self thymus order trigger immune response 
second signal system prevents mutating lines incorrectly reacting self 
system human second signal 
detector raises alarm chance false alarm auto immune reaction 
action ais waits fixed amount time say hours signal current implementation email message human 
signal received confirming anomaly detector enters competition memory detector loses competition remains naive match count reset 
second signal received ais assumes false alarm destroys detector natural immune system 
natural send messages ais case false alarms true anomalies ais adjust appropriately immediately deleting auto reactive detectors 
unfortunately create vulnerability malicious adversary send signals ais labeling true foreign packets false alarms ais certain forms attack 
form stimulation difficult subvert 
false alarms generally frequent true anomalies stimulation method additional advantage action human operator required frequent case 
summarizes lifecycle detector 
detector initially randomly created remains immature certain period time tolerization period 
detector matches string single time tolerization replaced new randomly generated detector string 
detector survives immaturity exist finite lifetime 
lifetime replaced new random detector string exceeded match threshold memory detector 
activation threshold exceeded mature detector activated 
activated detector receive costimulation dies implicit assumption activation false positive 
activated detector receives costimulation enters competition see randomly created immature match tolerization period mature naive match tolerization exceed activation threshold period don exceed activation activated threshold lifetime costimulation death memory detector indefinite lifespan 
memory detectors need match activated

individual population genetically capable making small set mhc types costimulation lifecycle detector 
memory match set mhc types varies different individuals 
consequently individuals population capable recognizing different profiles peptides providing important form population level diversity ais uses permutation masks achieve similar kind diversity 
permutation mask defines permutation bits string representation network packets 
detector set different randomly generated permutation mask 
limitation negative selection algorithm originally implemented result undetectable abnormal patterns called holes limit detection rates 
holes exist symmetric fixed probability matching rule permutation masks effectively change match rule host overcome hole limitation 
permutation mask controls network packet detection system analogous way different mhc types different sets peptides cell surface
