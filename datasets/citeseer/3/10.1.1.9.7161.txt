surface layer communicating agent part means communication 
traditionally primacy user needs system needs main motives human computer interface design today broad range methods techniques disposal help implement primacy individual computer system 
argue methods fall short intended purposes part aim surface layer communicating computer systems 
frequently communication difficulties caused incompatibilities underlying structures respective agents users perceive surface level 
cases obvious superficial modifications interface lead permanent solutions 
structural features surface different degrees constraints system imposes user actions 
consequence approach discussed structural aiming conceptual issues situated communication level 
structure proposed shows content information systems part computer system inner layer organized support different individual views domains expectation certain spatial concepts surfacing human agent communicating behavior 
support concerns essential lack support considered main reason failed interaction information systems 
individual views information systems hierarchical structures underlying visible part system 
exists gap user expectations structures organize information system 
mental external representations domain people interact domain external representation thereof form mental representations domain 
representations determined task hand tulving thompson may influenced existing mental representations 
vary significantly individuals assumed basic mechanisms formation mental representations may comparable humans actual mental representations domain differ significantly individual 
interaction domain constitutes concepts relevant entities grounded mental categories rosch 
concepts refinements categorization leads hierarchical mental representations 
mental representations differ individuals hierarchical categorization assumed differ 
externally representing concepts system accomplished providing information domain composed meaningful information bits form information set 
structure usually hierarchical hierarchies fixed time external representation created changed 
views mental representations largely hierarchically organized 
nature hierarchies conditions individual perception domain structure cf 
stevens coupe 
individual perception domain perspective determined task hand filter domain individual focus certain aspects deemed relevant ignore 
individuality aspects perception domain shaped hierarchical nature mental representations perspective domain determined current task leads individual view domain 
clearly views user task dependent 
information systems individuals confronted external representations domain differ significantly internal hierarchical representations 
greater difference higher individual cognitive burden relating internal external representations 
seen external representation domain system structure imposed information set 
current approaches structure information sets unsatisfactory resulting structures rigid correspond special view domain 
structures systems constructed cognitively adequate individual needs user 
argue structure needed allows support user task dependent views 
deficits existing structures common structure organizing elements information set tree 
tree imposes strict hierarchy information set tree sets subset disjoint cf 
alexander 
set information elements corresponds node tree structure node sequence nodes starting root tree lead node shown fig 
left 
predefined view supported hierarchical structure change system creation stated 
ordered trees cf 
hirtle allow overlapping structure cases allow sequence nodes leading element information set see right fig 

overlapping restricted just children node overlapping children different nodes allowed number views supported ordered trees small 
additionally ordered trees developed describe representational example tree left ordered tree right compare hirtle structure single subject domain recall experiments construction quite difficult generalize structuring information sets cf 
hirtle 
furnas promising glance 
formed imposing trees existing nodes existing tree adding new relationships 
properties resulting structure tree successors node form tree respectively see left fig 

single root node structure number different trees combined 
likewise sequences nodes leading node different trees 
number supported views equally restricted 
semi lattice structure allows multiple sequences nodes leading node 
alexander semi lattice collection sets overlapping sets intersection sets set collection 
elements underlying set contained information system may belong subset leading multiple sequences nodes element see fig 
right 
accordingly semi lattices support views 
support views relatively restricted 
elements example left semi lattice right set ordered single semi lattice necessarily structural relations elements arbitrary 
necessity certain elements set access expected users views

spatial behaviors trained accustomed external spatial representations spatial vocabulary purpose communicating spatial matters 
dealing affairs physical space come low cognitive costs humans 
reason readily focus certain quasi spatial properties domains essential properties largely non spatial compared physical space

increasing systems essentially non spatial trying apply spatial behaviors fails interacting information systems 
order user benefit application behaviors common approach lies imitation existing physical spaces cities shopping malls

case information hypertext systems unnecessary rebuild existing physical spaces order achieve adequate support transition spatial concepts 
introduce structure allows support navigational concepts mimicking spaces 
rebuilding physical spaces original purpose easing interaction poses additional cognitive burden user 
transfer spatial concepts behaviors extensively supported system promise emulation space impossible user forced learn novel spatial layout parts inherently related position property information items meant represent 
consequently focus hierarchical structures support user spatial behavior 
approach graduated semi lattices section semi lattices fall short mediation distances elements user 
navigating space distance important factor acquiring notion position distance starting point length path calculate estimate position 
semi lattices different sequences nodes certain node necessarily length see fig

call kind semi lattice graduated semi lattice see fig

multi dimensional graduated semi lattices shortcoming semi lattices number views supported small 
course true graduated semi lattices 
shortcoming understand term emulation way modelling emulated realize difference emulated real environment 
clearly sense emulation space relies just simple computer screen input devices impossible

interaction information systems mainly search information 
information searched corresponds elements information set characterized certain attributes search information systems seen process subsequently assigning specific values attributes 
preferred sequences assignment vary users individual views 
attributes easy specify user search irrelevant depend 
especially true underspecified search information 
initially vague notion target properties values assigned attributes needs interactively refined search continues 
consider example attribute size 
attribute undefined may specified assigning large value 
may assign size values large large quite large changing attribute current value large 
values clearly refinements large ordered 
results hierarchical structure possible values attribute 
course done attribute information elements leading hierarchical structures attributes 
structure elements information set 
value attribute information elements joined set described values equally specific value 
results hierarchical structure sets information elements corresponds hierarchy attribute values 
structure graduated semi lattice hierarchies attributes combined 
consequently results arbitrary set subset relations sets need structurally related conceptually related 
arbitrary relations 
just attributes common elements information set hierarchical structure split distinct hierarchies 
hierarchical structure attribute attribute common information elements necessarily elements part sets structure 
provided information searched contained information set 
attributes mutually independent attribute influence 
examples mutually independent attributes color size 
attributes mutually independent user concentrate specifying attribute simultaneously altering value blocking access 
constructive perspective mutually independent attributes correspond orthogonal dimensions structure 
dimension seen set values qualifying attribute orthogonality equivalent mutual independence attributes 
non orthogonality disadvantageous increases user cognitive burden navigating information structure 
changes dimension consequences dimension exists relation user action result directly observable 
interaction structure forces user explicitly keep track actions respective changes induced course user search information hard control 
focus orthogonal dimensions 
considering dimension graduated semi lattice imposed information elements 
arbitrary set subset relations resulting structure 
furthermore users specify attributes sequence 
call structure multi dimensional graduated semi lattice 
views transfer spatial behavior multi dimensional graduated semi lattices support multiple individual views 
possibility choosing specify attribute enormously increases number views supported compared supported just graduated semi lattices 
structure suited transition spatial concepts behaviors 
identifiable states possible combination specifications attribute distinguishable 
user change specification attribute assigning different value specific current 
leads combination specifications attributes consequently state user actively change states structure graduated semi lattices clearly hierarchical states changed specific states specific just attribute 
additionally structure easy navigate shown section 
navigating structure section take closer look exactly interaction structure works 
discuss structural support navigational concepts examine user perceives structure consider navigation user perspective 
visible interactions structure user interacts system multi dimensional graduated semilattices interact complex structure different aspects small part underlying structure visible children current node attribute second result selection determined corresponding subset information elements 
initially user assignment values 
consequence attribute assigned general value 
information set selected limited subset visible 
user assigns specific value attribute selection narrowed selected subset contains information elements conceptually match assigned value 
assignment general value attribute undoing specification results selection larger subset information elements 
structural support navigational concepts argued previously information systems partly perceived spatial terms 
correct spatial cues support presumptions follow application spatial behaviors 
section argued notion position determined graduated semi lattices distance root node measured consistently 
enables user establish notion position dimension combine estimate position 
navigation structure corresponds transitions states 
transitions comprehensible context may change gradually 
rapid changes context sense position may lost 
navigation structure necessarily stepwise step values levels adjacent current value level reached happen dimension 
just change attribute transition remains transparent user 
change takes place single dimension direction change specified context established 
values different degrees abstraction structured hierarchically dimension dimensions orthogonal attribute corresponds dimension specified different degree supports underspecified search 
establish context values define notion neighborhood follows conceptual neighborhood color red blue conveyed structural neighborhood small distances nodes structure 
explicitly define parent children siblings node direct neighbors 
formation values higher levels founded conceptual hierarchies ancestor node provides context siblings node node 
concepts represent subsumed general concept 
structure completely coherent 
ensures part structure remains reachable regardless node currently selected 
splitting hierarchies dimensions results comparatively flat hierarchy dimension turn leads easy fast navigation 
perceiving structure users normally maintain beliefs target domain interact information systems 
previously introduced concept user task dependent views beliefs 
interaction information system begins reciprocal process navigation perceived structure hand user notion system structure 
user notion determined initial beliefs domain incomplete may complemented changed due interaction system 
approach allows clearly defined view refinement construction view navigation 
users established beliefs domain clear possibly wrong notion system structure able employ beliefs navigating structure need realize actual structure provided system complex views 
possible user notion system structure individual view correspond view provided system 
user clearly defined view construct view beliefs influenced parts structure visited interaction 
complexity structure poses immediate problem user confronted structure needs normally build representation entire structure 
assuming user perspective far considered effects structural properties navigation

position determined retracing temporal sequence steps user taken 
form path spans multiple dimensions

interaction structure proposed offers range different clues nature possible selections different dimensions offer selections share common focus 
structural neighborhood introduced earlier allows maintainance gradually changing context selections narrowed decision possible selections level level abstraction concretion selections stepwise 
orthogonality dimensions assures clear comprehensible context dimension change time 
decisions taken decreased significantly selections share similar context need considered
