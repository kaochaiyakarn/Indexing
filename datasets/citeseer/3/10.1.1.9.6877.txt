overload 
potential consequence today media rich environment increases volume communication organization initiate receive 
substantial evidence demand communication elastic 
reduces monetary costs communication reducing tariff behavioral costs making easier accomplish amount communication typically increases mayer zipf 
purposes increased volume desirable potential negative outcome disrupt users lives 
general communication resource consuming process 
takes effort attention initiate receive communication 
result expect volume communication increases problems feeling rushed overloaded 
reason employees home office hard accomplish part volume communication office intense interrupting kraut 
analytically may distinguish disruptive impacts heavy communication information overload increase information received requests information communication intrusion increase interruption communications 
communications media may increase information overload communications media clearly intrusive 
synchronous media telephones face face meetings take place real time parties available time 
contrast asynchronous media fax electronic mail postal mail communication takes place staggered rounds scheduled sender recipient times convenient 
asynchronous communication result near disruptive synchronous medium phone doing answer 
new corporate communications media electronic mail asynchronous hypothesize add information adding commensurate intrusion 
total volume communication irrespective medium associated information overload 
second neglected issue concerning media disruption involves looking individuals separate roles senders receivers messages 
differences role implications degree communication media disruptive 
generally communication episode involves party initiated recipient 
roles different terms goals costs benefits 
initiator reason mind starting communication schedules time convenient 
recipient hand may thought willing victim initiator designs 
recipient perspective communication arrive random time interrupting ongoing 
communication request information aid benefit initiator recipient 
initiators recipients communications experience communication differently 
research examines perceived value costs communication role documents extent role differences vary medium 
hypothesize role differences reduced asynchronous media electronic mail fax voice mail enable receivers schedule receipt messages

peripheral organization partly matter geography sociological dimensions peripherality 
occupational status placement organizational networks gender may affect peripherality may influence communication organizational knowledge 
feldman hesse sproull kiesler walsh argue electronic mail particularly suited reducing peripherality disadvantages organizations 
electronic mail features distribution lists electronic bulletin boards increase number people receive particular communication 
mechanisms enable electronic mail users bump information organizational members just physical proximity functions

analysis variance shows accomplishing maintaining relationships initiators perceived communications valuable recipients dependent variables synchronous communication perceived valuable asynchronous media 
electronic mail judged especially useful keeping news personalities gossip 
purpose electronic mail rated positively face face communication significantly better fax 
recording communication 
communication episode data show people keep records asynchronous communication messages synchronous communication conversations presumably electronic mail fax recorded form 
respondents reported slightly keep records fax communication electronic mail difference statistically reliable 
field struck extent electronic mail fax absorbed normal bureaucratic 
employees printed filed copies electronic messages received 
archived messages selectively disk 
discussion research intended explore consequences rich multi media environment typical today corporations 
finding individuals choose media specific messages don specialize terms communication aggregate 
people jobs require substantial communication communicate heavily media available 
favor channel phone user electronic mail user 
firm heaviest communicators tended people temporary teams groups people involves persuasion sales 
theoretical terms multiple communications media organization appear synergistic additive relationship competitive 
electronic mail distinctive respects 
employees electronic mail extensively net media better informed committed management goals 
finding remained significant factoring potential confounding issues users status firm kind 
reason electronic mail users superior organizational knowledge may electronic mail promotes information spillover focal intended recipient parties directly involved message 
electronic mail compared media requires little effort add multiple recipients message send messages distribution lists capture electronic messages resending 
data suggest electronic mail medium ratio messages received messages sent large 
suggests spillover effect stronger electronic mail media 
spillover phenomenon dramatically illustrated episodes large corporations privileged information spread electronic mail 
findings suggest electronic mail doesn just broadcast organizational gossip informs large numbers employees important events informative function associated greater commitment understanding strategy 
tendencies large organization aspect electronic mail welcomed 
researchers reported electronic mail particularly advantageous peripheral members organization help workers feel involved increase effectiveness low status individuals 
peripheral employees knowledgeable electronic mail increases knowledge find evidence peripheral employees especially aided electronic mail communications media 
electronic mail benefits central peripheral employees equally 
unable support peripherality thesis 
studied disruptive effects communications media including information overload interruptions media 
respondents reports disruption associated heavier communications levels 
problem appears severe face face telephone communications newer asynchronous media
