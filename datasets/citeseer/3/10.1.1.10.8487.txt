flip zooming technique flip zooming belongs focus context group information visualizations 
visualizes information consists number distinct objects sequential order 
object rectangular area called tile tile designated focus 
focus placed center display area tiles placed giving focus significantly screen space available see page 
information visualized consists suitably distinct objects transformed discrete objects 
compared printing text 
text short printed single page text structured number distinct sections suitable print single page 
similarly flip zooming requires information split pieces suitable area tile 
case information consists number distinct objects clear sequential order exists superimposed information 
example collection unrelated image files sequential order ordering file names 
focus context technique provide way showing information presentation compact form focus order fit context area 
card defines ways reducing information filtering away significant information creating fewer case selective aggregation called micro macro readings larger coherent structures arise details highlighting important information distortion graphical presentation information 
flip zooming uses form distortion simple perspective scaling function presents context tiles focus tiles viewed distance
