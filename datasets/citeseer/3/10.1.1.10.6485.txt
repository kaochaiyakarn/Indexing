traditional notion utility motivation places value actions world states wide ranging concept utility 
traditional view agent examines options chooses highest utility 
whilst performing task motivation involved intimately agent decision making process 
motivated agent dynamically changing internal environment provided motivations influence decisions 
example presence food agent may may choose eat depending state internal environment specifically hunger motivation

follows 
motivation considered dynamic control process influence motivation agent decision making increase decrease response changes environment changes state motivations 
notion intensity capture dynamic property 
intensity represented real valued number range represents intensity represents maximum intensity 
intense motivation influence motivation exert decision making process 
time agent motivations characterised intensity provides indication motivation appropriateness current environment 
say motivation high intensity goals generated highly relevant agent current environment 
order achieve way assessing current environment terms relevance motivations 
simplest way achieve attaching set cues motivation determine motivation intensity updated 
cues similar invocation conditions plans bdi architectures 
way cue represents condition satisfied results motivation intensity updated amount 
amount fixed depend measurement environment 
update methods calls different type cue called respectively discrete continuous 
cases agent needs know world state order update motivations proposition world state true false 
discrete cues provide information agent 
example particular motivation may update associated intensity fixed amount 
discrete cues represent sets attributes define contain referent type attribute attribute case continuous cues agent alters intensity motivations proportion measurement takes environment 
example inventory agent may update motivation keep inventory amount proportional amount stock item depleted 
continuous cue return current amount remaining associated cue referent 
define continuous cues similarly discrete cues consider effects

view worth goals motivation detailed understanding model motivation return consideration goal parameters investigate related motivations 
concept worth ways 
propose mechanism worth goal dynamically set function intensity underlying motivation 
way worth goal provides way choosing competing goals 
second determine worth state relation goal metric measure proximity environmental state goal 
way possible judgements relative satisfaction environmental state offers satisfying goal 
example agent highly motivated eat hunger motivation high intensity assign high worth generated goals satisfied mitigate hunger 
goals assigned low worth hunger motivation agent low intensity 
value worth goal depends crucially underlying motivational intensity 
similarly world state approximates goal state having eaten receive higher worth value 
show signature function calculates goal worth omit details space considerations 
state rat example agent means discover eat 
refer goal parameter values determined underlying motivation 
specifically relation motivational intensity value placed goal parameter 
example agent hunger motivation high intensity parameter associated goal eat state agent eats quantity close agent eating capacity assume parameters pre defined range acceptable values 
suppose possible bring exact state defined goal approximation 
go evaluating state 
concept worth oriented domain allows development notion state state proximity represented various metrics depending scenario consideration 
example proximity current state goal state defined difference agent current measure level defined goal parameter 
measuring proximity current state goal state assign worth value states relation goal 
effect state underlying motivation mitigation function takes goal associated motivation current world state defined agents current view environment returns value mitigate intensity underlying motivation 
states completely match defined goal maximally satisfy mitigate associated motivation 
show signature mitigation function omit details due space considerations 
mitigate view motivation rat course achieve possible determine suitable metrics domain characteristics goal parameters state state proximity defined 
example describing inventory scenario need represent sets items stock inventory batteries transistors goals agent specify amount type item buy say batteries 
numerical value goal parameter represents ideal parameter value adjusted face currently active constraints 
constructing environments metrics suitable granularity possible calculate proximity state consequently calculate worth environmental state relation goal state terms proximity 
specifying goal collection attributes certain relations necessary define certain goal parameters represent ideal values particular attribute defined goal 
example ideal value simply refer quantity product transistors position object object location 
alternatively ideal value defined collection attributes amount paid batteries transistors 
worked example describe detail inventory example introduced 
agent keep track number items inventory purchase appropriate amounts consumed 
simplicity consider types stock items transistors batteries 
maximum quantity transistors batteries 
agent values transistor battery 
agent number constraints 
amount stock stored exceed maximum available space 
maximum monthly budget purchasing stock current budget exceed maximum 
time stock consumed inventory depleted 
suppose agent motivations economy constraint motivation represents concern money spent time mt constraint motivation related full inventory empty inventory urgent need ensure inventory kept re stock motivation 
motivation appropriate cues continuous cue referent state purchasing budget lower budget values bring higher intensity levels 
conversely intensity mt increased empty inventory increases proportion declining levels stock type remaining inventory 
specified time agent checks stock types inventory current level depletion changes intensity example depletion type stock simple additive effect easy imagine different types item different intensity effects depending relative need products 
example start month agent checks inventory sees transistors batteries dropped respective maximum amounts 
result agent updates motivation stock items 
motivations economy urgency updated 
quantity stock left inventory update intensity suppose effect stock depletion leaves intensity value bring stocks back quota agent buy transistors batteries values represent goal parameters 
available budget causes motivation intensity 
mt updated measuring space left inventory 
store room space left 
space available urgent need larger amounts take longer process install warehouse 
assume agent hours take delivery install required goods warehouse 
batteries take hour unit process transistors take hours 
imagine intensity mt calculating space remaining 
cues determine parameters agent goals values taken constraints 
exactly batteries transistors needed total amount time allocated delivery batteries transistors exceed hours total cost exceed 
may case ideal values attached goal parameters satisfied constraints 
agent re stock batteries transistors needed processing time reach hours total cost 
need discover feasible goal parameter values constraints 
need certain respect motivation relative importance 
way proceed order concerns terms intensity underlying motivations determines importance satisfy important concern satisfy successively important concerns whilst time degrading solution preceding step 
time motivation highest intensity constraint highest priority followed re motivation intensity economy motivation lowest intensity associated constraint lowest priority 
mathematically represent problem follows take values pass goal programming gp algorithm form mathematical programming see return best values concerns best refers values satisfy requirements highest priority concern lower priority concerns 
case gp algorithm gives values transistors batteries 
result satisfies constraints whilst minimally deviating goals 
gp returns values best satisfy ideal values concern worst minimally deviates values
