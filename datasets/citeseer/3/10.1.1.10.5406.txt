architectural principles routing section architectural principles reducing interdomain routing complexity 
routing architecture base routing assignments consistent view routing state 

interfaces routing protocols minimize unexpected unwanted interactions 

interdomain routing mechanisms directly support flexible expressive policies 
subsection section discusses principles 
principle high level rationale followed specific examples today interdomain routing architecture violates principle 
examples suggest adhering architectural principle helps solve problem 
compute routes consistent state routing state logic located system components assigning routes 
logical participants interdomain routing protocol ases individual routers 
interdomain routing architecture view single participant base routing decisions network wide view available routes configuration state routers hand forward data traffic concern routes computed 
current interdomain routing system violates architectural principle ways decomposing routing configuration state routers unnecessarily complicates policy expression 
distributing state achieve scalability reliability sense aspects configuration replicated decomposed routers 
configuration state logically centralized simplifies policy expression compromising scalability reliability 
problem network operators implement high level policies preventing routes learned advertised 
implementing policy currently requires modifying configurations multiple routers import policies tag ebgp learned routes appropriately export policies routers filter routes tag advertising ebgp neighbors 
solution defining routing policy network wide basis obviate need level indirection 
network wide configuration management entity know origin routes ebgp sessions advertised allow direct expression policies sessions 
distributed path selection causes routing decisions router depend configuration routers 
subtle configuration details affect route router selects router learns route 
computing routes basis consistent view routing state reduce interdomain routing dependencies subtle details 
problem omitting single ibgp session full mesh configuration leave router route certain destinations intradomain topology connected 
distributed path selection predicting effects configuration changes traffic flow difficult 
solution entity performs path assignment behalf routers control path assignment ensure router assigned route destination 
router unaware state routers lack information may result incorrect suboptimal routing 
implementing bgp features routers features difficult reason 
example replication functionality intended improve reliability cause forwarding loops feature intended prevent routing instability slow convergence 
routing architecture implement features module complete view network state routers partial view network state doing allow module ensure sensible consistent network wide route assignment override feature interactions cause incorrect routing 
problems router typically ibgp sessions multiple route reflectors improve reliability 
route reflector fails protocol oscillation forwarding loops arise second route reflector different view best routes 
placing route reflectors close reduces kinds inconsistencies introduces fate sharing risk shared failures 
example bgp route flap damping suppresses unstable routes change frequently 
unfortunately single failure trigger advertisements mistakenly activate route flap damping 
network operators backwards select configuration parameters prevent erroneous damping 
solution entity performs route computation consistent view available routes network topology replicated standard distributed systems algorithms 
route reflectors replica assign route router independently location network 
module knowledge routes assigned router detect route changes caused path exploration avoid unnecessarily suppressing route 
control routing protocol interaction dividing functionality distinct modules clear interfaces control complexity 
routing system igp computes paths routers ebgp computes paths ases ibgp propagates ebgp learned routes 
higher layer overlay networks route traffic host hops abstracting ip substrate entirely 
unfortunately modules today interdomain routing system interact undesirable ways hard wired interactions ebgp igp constrain operator control path selection 
internal topology influence bgp routing decisions allows nearest exit routing router choice egress point relatively insensitive small igp changes 
problem bgp decision process uses igp path cost break tie equally routes 
internal events link failures planned maintenance traffic engineering lead changes igp path costs 
igp changes cause router change best bgp route causing abrupt unwanted traffic shifts 
additionally operator may want redirect traffic egress link 
today requires complex manipulation bgp import policies egress points attractive 
solution better control interactions ebgp igp operator directly assign new routes routers changing bgp routing policies 
inconsistencies ibgp igp cause forwarding loops route oscillation 
operators test ibgp configuration satisfies sufficient conditions correctness approach robust operators commonly ibgp 
routing architecture explicitly enforce correctness constraints 
problem ibgp route reflector selects distributes best bgp route destination prefix 
result clients necessarily bgp routing decisions full mesh ibgp configuration 
particular route reflector clients may different igp path costs egress routers leading different bgp routing decisions shown previously 
inconsistencies lead protocol oscillations persistent forwarding loops router forwards packet egress point router selected bgp route different egress point 
cause level forwarding path differ bgp path complicate debugging 
solution agnostic igp forwarding paths routing architecture available knowledge explicitly enforce consistency router level forwarding paths 
interactions overlay networks underlying network degrade performance 
overlay networks measure path performance tune routing edge network typically lack detailed measurements traffic routing help better decisions direct control ip layer protocols mechanisms 
routing architecture provide information control overlays need defined interface 
problem route control products help isps select upstream routes destination host overlays ron circumvent failures congestion directing traffic intermediate host 
lack complete information routing traffic engineering optimizations overlays increase congestion decrease effectiveness traffic engineering underlay network degrade user performance 
solution direct control overlays operate efficiently sending traffic congested links network edge 
information routing dynamics overlays pre avoid outages 
support flexible expressive policies interdomain routing architecture support flexible expressive policy 
need greater flexibility selecting exporting routes driven extensions bgp past fifteen years believe trend continue 
bgp highly configurable operation controlled indirect mechanisms expose details abstracting 
architectural simplifications better abstractions simplify configuration languages policy specification simpler expressive 
points illustrate today routing architecture satisfy goals bgp mechanisms preclude expression certain policies difficult express 
network operators influence outcome bgp decision process configuring policies modify attributes bgp routes 
better configuration languages helpful architecture provide flexible support assigning paths routers 
problem moving traffic inter link requires identifying subset prefixes carries desired amount traffic determining express subset common path regular expression modifying import policies routers assign smaller local preference routes matching expressions observing resulting traffic flow iterating necessary 
solution tools help predict effects policy changes routing architecture allow operator move traffic explicitly assigning paths 
bgp mechanisms impede multiple ases cooperating selecting routes satisfy goals 
ases cooperate ensure reachability today routing architecture directly support type cooperation 
interdomain routing policies space balance dependence neighbors connectivity rest internet competition neighbors customers revenue 
operators currently resolve conflicts outside infrastructure architecture directly support route selection negotiated preferences financial incentives 
problem suppose wants advertise backup route neighbor 
ases negotiate backup signal band 
advertising route modify export policies attach signal backup route neighbor modify import policies routers lower local preference value routes community 
solution route negotiation fundamental inter cooperation interdomain routing support directly

describe rcp single logically centralized entity domain 
centralized function implemented reliable physically distributed fashion avoid introducing single point failure ensuring robust route distribution 
believe existing distributed systems techniques may applicable address issue detail briefly discuss section 
describe rcp terms phases controlling routing protocol interactions replacing ibgp route reflection rcp gaining flexibility route selection making rcp endpoint ebgp sessions neighboring ases enabling changes interdomain routing routers exchange routes ases ebgp new protocol 
describing rcp terms stages demonstrate rcp incrementally deployable importantly provides significant benefits individual ases deployed rcp 
addition steps incremental deployment phase provides new functionality remaining backwards compatible bgp 
control protocol interactions phase rcp deployment shown involves minor changes ibgp configuration inside 
rcp ebgp ibgp pe ng phase replaces pairwise ibgp sessions routers ibgp sessions rcp 
rcp uses knowledge igp topology best routes border router routing decisions behalf router 
rcp distributes path assignment routers ibgp 
rcp monitors igp maintain accurate date view igp topology previous explains monitor igp disrupting operation network 
having routers propagate ebgp learned routes ibgp hierarchy router sends best route ebgp learned destination rcp ibgp session 
rcp computes route router conveys route ibgp session 
rcp require changes routers aside configuration ibgp sessions rcp configuration routers ases 
isps deploy monitoring infrastructure keep track network state routing protocol behavior 
stage rcp essentially igp bgp monitoring infrastructure controls route selection 
stage rcp closely resembles architecture route reflection route reflectors rcp return different best route router 
example rcp compute route router selected full mesh ibgp topology 
rcp offers flexibility route reflection limited emulating full mesh ibgp scenario rcp intentionally select routes control interactions ibgp igp 
rcp may appear similar previous route servers forward routes clients forwards route client rcp remains backwards compatible bgp enables customized path selection 
rest subsection examples show stage rcp deployment simplifies important network management tasks 
enforceable correctness constraints invariants 
complete knowledge ibgp igp topologies rcp enforce clean separation routing layers 
example rcp ensure router forwarding path selects best bgp route destination prefix prevents forwarding loops protocol oscillations arise conventional ibgp configurations 
rcp useful detecting persistent oscillations caused med attribute occurs routers total ordering set candidate routes 
complete view best routes border router rcp recognize router single consistent ordering force system stable path assignment 
avoiding unintentional hot potato routing changes 
small changes igp topology due traffic engineering failures planned maintenance trigger large unnecessary shifts ebgp routes bgp hot potato routing behav rcp ebgp ibgp second deployment phase rcp operates similar manner phase rcp ebgp sessions routers ases relying border routers learn routes ases apply local policies 
ior 
rcp allow network operator add remove internal links modify igp costs worrying side effects bgp path selection 
controlling path selection router rcp force routers continue egress point link failure small igp cost change egress point slightly closer 
rcp take care ensure router forwarding path egress point router continues pick egress point 
addition avoiding unnecessary traffic shifts preventing abrupt routing changes improves global routing stability reducing number ebgp routing changes propagated downstream neighbors 
flexible traffic engineering 
rcp intentionally change egress point router move traffic edge link congested downstream path 
approach allows balance traffic load changes import policies ebgp sessions igp link costs 
addition controlling egress point rcp dictate entire forwarding path relying igp 
example rcp send router bgp route hop corresponds immediate neighbor igp topology cause router create forwarding table entry maps destination prefix outgoing link connecting directly neighboring router 
kind fine grained control useful planned routing changes 
rcp routing changes incrementally router time avoid creating transient forwarding loops convergence 
network wide path selection policy deployment phase border routers continue exchange routes neighboring domains 
border routers apply local import export policies forward single best route prefix rcp 
second stage rcp exchanges routes directly border routers ases shown 
neighboring ases modify configuration ebgp sessions peer rcp individual routers 
change involves changes router configuration underlying hardware software offers significant benefits rcp access routes learned ebgp ases routing policies applied directly rcp border routers need bgp configuration ibgp session rcp 
phase rcp significantly simplifies network management 
simpler routing configuration 
ebgp learned routes place configuration routing policies re router path rcp routers routes endpoints 
routes established injecting routes endpoints routing protocol configuring static routes 
side entirely rcp 
bgp communities tag routes router ensure correct handling router rcp classify select routes 
example suppose ebgp routes learned peer advertised 
rcp maintain local registry peer customer numbers ensure routes neighboring peer advertised ebgp sessions peer ases 
today routing infrastructure auxiliary information peer customer ases expressed indirectly import policies tag routes learned certain ebgp sessions export policies filter routes tags 
rcp performing routing decisions type decomposition unnecessary 
network wide traffic engineering 
second phase rcp access ebgp learned routes just best paths selected border routers 
complete control selection paths rcp disregard unwieldy bgp decision process 
rcp influence routing decisions various routers directly local preference settings individual routers 
generating complex import policy rules manipulate local preference attribute rcp explicitly decide path router select destination prefix 
addition comparing ebgp learned routes rcp base routing decisions auxiliary information measured traffic volumes performance statistics observed packet loss commercial relationships neighboring domains pricing model 
intelligent route flap damping 
bgp update sequences caused routers performing path exploration learning route withdrawal neighboring router second best path receives corresponding withdrawal path 
rcp prevent damping discarding stable route 
having routers implement route flap damping independently rcp damp routes behalf routers network wide view ebgp learned routes 
additionally rcp determine advertisements appear stem path exploration information delay preventing routers neighboring ases receiving flurry transient advertisements path exploration 
coalescing routing table entries customized aggregation 
networks advertise multiple subnets address block balance flow traffic incoming links lead large routing tables larger number bgp update messages 
individual router typically safely aggregate subnets hop router may need treat subnets differently 
operators conservative aggregating routes prevent unintentional forwarding loops 
giving rcp control bgp routes sent router permits aggressive aggregation 
example rcp discovers bgp routes router outgoing interface send single route router substantially reduce memory requirements routing forwarding tables 
note rcp send aggregated route router initial routes different paths individual routers longer act information 
technique reduce number bgp updates individual router coalesce subnets constructing local forwarding table approach reduce size bgp routing table number bgp update messages 
bgp routing changes affect attributes path community med affect forwarding 
redefinition inter routing third phase multiple ases exchange interdomain routing information directly previously shown 
phases rcp routing decisions behalf routers 
rcp simply ebgp exchange routing information exchanging routes ebgp strictly necessary 
rcp enable ases better coordinate diagnosing routing problems selecting paths 
better network diagnostics troubleshooting 
rcp provide diagnostic information neighboring remote ases request 
network operators regularly send email mailing lists ask operators possible reachability problems diagnose problems arise 
deployed ases collection treated distributed database routing information maintains portion provides query interface information 
allow ases query routes learned ases debugging rcp query interface sort master looking glass server entire verification verifying path asking ases path learned corresponding route 
course diagnostic information need limited bgp data 
example rcp maintain information intra topology changes link congestion performance statistics help explain disruptions performance 
new interdomain routing protocols 
rcp enables variety proposals fundamental changes interdomain routing 
proposals advocated modifying way interdomain routing protocol selects propagates routes 
example new routing protocol attach prices advertised routes explicitly support inter negotiation select routes 
base routing decisions measured endto performance proposed overlay networks performance information available host overlays appropriate interfaces 
proposals suggested ways improve security performing path authentication origin authentication 
proposals feasible deployment path require fundamental protocol changes backwards compatible installed base routers 
rcp allows deployment new routing protocol changes modifying replacing existing infrastructure

transient inconsistencies occur routers receive updates rcp certain order 
example router path destination includes routers rcp assigned new path transient forwarding loops result 
pathology worse transient loops occur ibgp convergence today deserves attention 
routers modified support commit operation allow routers path execute update time
