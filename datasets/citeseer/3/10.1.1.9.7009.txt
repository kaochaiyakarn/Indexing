application ongoing project methods reputation analysis 
email client looks mail sender reputation network provides inline rating email message 
configured show trust levels mail sender general level respect certain topic 
spam filters indicate messages ignore reputation ratings tell users messages important read 
consider case research groups working project 
professors head group know professor knows students group 
familiar students group 
part project student sends email group professor professor know message worth paying attention 
name unfamiliar message distinguishable mail inbox 
scenario exactly type situation improves 
professors need rate students professor 
reputation algorithm looks paths graph just direct edges path professor research group students direct professor professor link 
student professor met exchanged correspondence student gets high rating intermediate relationship 
turns students sending junk type messages network producing high rating professor simply add direct rating sender downgrading reputation 
override direct ratings factored ratings professor intermediate step path 
ratings alongside messages useful value basically replicate way trust relationships reputations social settings 
example today sensible polite student professor met start email indication relationships student professors advisor collaborated topic past suggested contact receiving note professor check colleague student claims correct just take claims face value extending trust attention student basis presumed relationship 
effort needed verify student phone email walking hall weighed possible harm student seriously tends extending trust blindly worthwhile 
context mail lowers cost sharing trust judgments widely dispersed rarely interacting groups people 
gathering machine encoded assertions people trustworthiness reasoning assertions presenting augmented assertions user friendly way
