jini mobile service discovery jini built top java object rmi system 
illustrated service proxy object registered service registry called lookup service constitutes announcement process 
client downloads service proxy discovery process invokes method access service 
srv proxy attrs lookup service discovery announcement service srv proxy attrs invocation service client service provider jini service discovery protocol lookup service thought directory service services discovered resolved 
services client java interface including methods invoke associated descriptive attributes 
lookup service maps interface exposed client set service proxy objects 
specifically performing lookup service interface results service proxy object downloaded client rmi stubs may communicate back services 
jini requirement jvm rmi appears obstacle wide acceptance small mobile devices problem alleviated jini surrogate architecture 
context aware service discovery means provide appropriate service mobile users exploiting meaningful contextual information 
jini chosen base system build demonstrate context aware service discovery system 
service discovery protocols jini context awareness support
