major paradigms surveyed included kalman filter techniques approaches dempster expectation maximization algorithm occupancy grid techniques techniques learning object models 
emphasis placed relating techniques point relative strengths weaknesses 
believe algorithms described article representative examples state art robotic mapping specifically area indoor navigation 
quite remarkable virtually state art algorithms robotic mapping share mathematical foundation probabilistic 
versions bayes filters underlying generative probabilistic description robot motion perception 
development parallels broader trend mobile robotics probabilistic techniques commonly method choice ad hoc approaches behavior techniques 
situation robot mapping encouraging 
approximately decades research field matured point detailed maps complex environments built real time specifically indoors 
existing techniques robust noise cope large range environments 
exists large number challenging open problems worth decades research 
particular published methods assume world change mapping 
real environments dynamic 
despite initial successes discussed section far away practical algorithms mapping dynamic environments theoretical framework accompanying methods 
clearly issue addressed robots shall operate environments long periods time long envisioned personal service robots 
viable research goal develop lifelong mapping robot capable continually updating map object models lifetime 
need technologies understanding environment dynamics just adapting changes anticipate 
second shortcoming current technology arises vast amount knowledge people possess environments presently brought bear mapping problem 
object mapping algorithm exploited basic piece information frequent occurrence large flat surfaces corridor type environments 
clearly tremendous knowledge objects surround typical indoor environment vegetation objects outdoor environment objects sea bed 
cases additional information specific environment satellite imagery architectural blueprints 
methods needed information mapping 
statistical point view holy grail mapping calculate full posteriors maps robot poses object models hard problems unknown correspondences 
problem hard effectively unsolved static environments challenging dynamic environments 
unclear calculating posteriors feasible reasonably complex problems resort solutions em algorithm maximize likelihood subjects local maxima 
article placed considerably little emphasis multi robot collaboration mapping 
clearly envisioned operational scenarios involved teams robots multiple collaborative robot building maps clearly worthwhile research goal 
existing techniques relative starting positions robots known existence multiple robots simply adds dimension statistical mapping problem 
building reasonable maps relative initial position robots unknown largely open problem 
complicating factor multi robot mapping overlap maps acquired locally robots may unknown 
challenging estimate relative location robots acquire local map information 
robots detect complex correspondence problems may arise related identification individual robots 
dimension worth exploring topic unstructured environments 
examples survey focused indoor environments possess lot structure 
outdoor underwater planetary environments possess structure come larger variety 
extreme environment may entirely unstructured piles robot want explore natural disaster terrorist attack 
techniques described inapplicable 
extending existing mapping techniques environments important goal ongoing research 
approaches reviewed article addresses issue robot control 
ultimate goal robotics robots right thing 
map acquisition mean control exploration robot acquiring data 
broader context issue involves question elements environment modeled successfully enabling robot perform task 
issues addressed decades ad hoc ways little known general interplay mapping control uncertainty 
summary difficult imagine truly autonomous robot able acquire model environment 
list provides sample important open problems 
hope article documents believe robot mapping continue highly active viable research area significant relevance goal building truly autonomous robots
