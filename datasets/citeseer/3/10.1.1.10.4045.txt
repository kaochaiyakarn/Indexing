evaluating retrieval performance clickthrough data thorsten joachims cornell university department computer science ithaca ny usa tj cs cornell edu explores method evaluating quality retrieval functions clickthrough data 
manual relevance assessments clickthrough data collected low cost overhead user 
observed clicking behavior typically biased difficult analyze 
overcome problem explores experiment setup generates unbiased feedback relative quality search results 
theoretical analysis shows method gives results evaluation traditional relevance judgments mild assumptions 
empirical analysis gives verification assumptions 
presentation bias clickthrough data search engine provides better results google 
evaluating hypotheses cast problem statistical inference 
unfortunately regular clickthrough data suited answer question principled way 
consider setup gathering implicit feedback data experiment setup regular clickthrough data user types query unified interface query sent search engines returned rankings selected random user 
ranks links user clicked recorded 
example observation experiment user types query support vector machine receives ranking search engine clicks links ranked 
data collected boyan shows setup leads strong presentation bias making results difficult interpret 
consider average rank clicks evaluation presentation hand tuned hand tuned table average retrieval functions hand tuned strategy uses different weights html tags implemented laser :10.1.1.41.9172
rows correspond retrieval method laser query time columns hold values subsequent evaluation methods 
figures reported means standard errors 
table taken performance measure example :10.1.1.41.9172
conclude type clickthrough data 
table shows average retrieval strategies averaged queries 
rows correspond retrieval method user columns show average subsequent evaluation retrieval functions 
looking diagonal table average equal methods 
subjective judgments retrieval functions substantially different ranking quality 
lack difference observed average explained follows 
users typically scan links ranking clicking link interpreted relevance judgment absolute scale 
document ranked lower list relevant user saw 
appears users click relatively promising links top independent absolute relevance 
hypothesis supported diagonal entries table 
difficult derive formal interpretation type data 
statistics number links user clicked difficult interpret 
clear clicks indicate better ranking user relevant documents worse ranking user look documents fulfill information need 
problems lead experiment setup leads clickthrough data difficult analyze principled way 
unbiased clickthrough data comparing search engines previous experimental setup leads biased data free design forms presentation exhibit property 
suitable setup deciding clickthrough data retrieval strategy better 
mild assumptions generates unbiased google results

data hypothesis test paired observations 
experiment setup unbiased clickthrough data user types query unified interface 
query sent search engines returned rankings mixed point top links combined ranking contain top ka kb links rankings ka kb 
combined ranking user ranks links user clicked recorded 
combined ranking exists 
example 
results search engines combined ranking user 
note abstracts aspects presentation unified user tell retrieval strategy proposed particular page 
example user clicks links 
inference draw clicks 
assumes user scans combined ranking top bottom skipping links setup ensures point scan user observed links top ranking ranking way combined ranking gives equal presentation bias search engines 
assumes user click relevant link provides information judge relevance better random clicks convey information relative quality top ka kb links retrieval strategies 
user clicks links retrieval strategy reasonable conclude top ka kb links relevant example user seen top links individual rankings clicked link combined ranking 
decided click links top returned google link 
reasonable conclude probability larger random top links google judged better query 
averaging multiple relative comparisons allows applying statistical tests 
evaluate retrieval strategy wins frequently pairwise comparisons 
resulting decision relative retrieval quality retrieval functions distribution queries users
