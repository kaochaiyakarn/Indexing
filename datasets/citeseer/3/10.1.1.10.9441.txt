unsupervised text mining ontology extraction evaluation statistical measures marie walter daelemans university antwerp belgium ua ac walter daelemans report comparative evaluation carried field unsupervised text mining 
worked parsed medical corpus different statistical measures 
measures rate verb object dependencies select reliable ones measure 
apply pattern matching clustering algorithms classes dependencies order build sets semantically related words establish semantic links 
evaluate impact statistical measures initial selection dependencies quality results 

today powerful robust language processing tools allows parse large text collections provide potentially relevant information extracting semantic knowledge 
statistics help selecting relevant information modeling semantic representations choosing right statistical tool crucial point 
context experiment project purpose project development linguistic tools unsupervised ontology extraction 
general approach consists working domain specific corpora apply syntactic parsing 
select specific syntactic structures perform clustering pattern matching order extract semantic relations nominal expressions 
study reporting focuses selection syntactic structures precisely comparison various statistical methods allow rate goodness structures detected corpus unsupervised way 
opted extraction techniques unsupervised learning methods require specific external domain knowledge thesauri tagged corpora 
rely principle selectional restrictions states syntactic structures provide relevant information semantic content case heads object phrases occurring verb share semantic feature

applied corpus memory shallow parser detects subject verb object structures buchholz buchholz daelemans shallow parser gives possibility exploit verb object dependencies 
selectional restrictions associated structure imply nps occurring head object common set verbs share semantic information

corpus provides huge number syntactic structures associating verb nominal string ns deal fact parser produces mistakes score objects verb object structures statistically relevant 
need find way select reliable dependencies applying automatic techniques extraction ontological relations

hindle measure gets second best score 
step process increased clusters established links information extracted pattern ns preposition ns situation changes 
experiment ns occurring verb object structures counted results globally worse 
reason prepositional pattern selecting ns highly rated verb object structures 
consider part experiment occurrences ns verb object structures considered appears baseline measure performs elaborated measures 
consider part experiment occurrences ns considered notice hindle measure performance increased classes classes jaccard measure decreased classes classes 
due initial selection verb object dependencies hindle selection allowed prepositional patterns added clusters 
hand jaccard measure tends select dependencies containing elements appear frequently prepositional pattern 
consequence clusters produced hindle measure combine better patterns clusters jaccard measures improvement decrease performance 
cases baseline measure frequency measure gets worst results 
resnik measure performs poorly just baseline shows selectional preference strength verbs constitute relevant information task 
study concerning automatic acquisition taxonomies cimiano results different statistical measures concept classification task compared considering measure threshold 
consider induce bias threshold measures select different number terms reason carried comparison considering initial number verb object classes selected 

study shown depending data perform clustering different measures produce different results 
consider occurrences ns induces important discrepancy measures
