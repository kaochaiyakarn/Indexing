information retrieval web critical goal successful information retrieval web identify pages high quality relevance user query 
aspects web ir differentiate somewhat challenging traditional problems exemplified trec competition 
foremost pages web contain links pages analyzing web graph structure possible determine global notion page quality 
notable early successes area include pagerank algorithm globally analyzes entire web graph provided original basis ranking google search engine kleinberg hits algorithm analyzes local neighborhood web graph containing initial set web pages matching user query 
time linked methods ranking web pages proposed including variants pagerank hits remains active research area fertile research ground explored 
just looking link structure web pages possible exploit anchor text contained links indication content web page pointed 
especially anchor text tends short gives concise human generated description content web page 
harnessing anchor text possible index terms web page page contains images seen example visually impressive home pages contain actual text 
determining terms anchors surrounding text indexing page presents interesting research venues 
adversarial classification dealing spam web particularly intriguing problem web ir arises attempt commercial interests unduly ranking web pages engaging various forms spamming 
common method spamming involves placing additional keywords entire dictionaries invisible text web page page potentially matches user queries page really irrelevant queries 
methods effective traditional ir ranking schemes link structure limited utility context global link analysis 
realizing spammers utilize link spam create large numbers web pages contain links pages rankings wish raise 
identifying spam text linked analyses web open problems ai techniques natural language processing nlp machine learning ml direct impact 
example statistical nlp happy searcher methods determine likelihood text web page represents natural writing 
similarly classification methods applied problem identifying spam versus non spam pages textual non textual link information classifier 
especially interesting classification schemes adversarial context spammers continually seek ways automatic filters 
adversarial classification area precious little done effective methods provide large gains web search adversarial text classification tasks spam filtering email 
evaluating search results advances ranking search results proper evaluation improvements non trivial task 
contrast traditional ir evaluation methods manually classified corpora trec collections evaluating efficacy web search engines remains open problem subject various workshops 
efforts area examined interleaving results different ranking schemes statistical tests results users clicked determine ranking scheme better 
lines decision theoretic analysis maximizing users utility searching considering relevance results time taken find results means determining goodness ranking scheme 
commercial search engines various manual statistical evaluation criteria evaluating ranking functions 
principled automated means large scale evaluation ranking results wanting development help improve commercial search engines create better methodologies evaluate ir research broader contexts 
web create kernels meaning challenge web search determining relatedness fragments text fragments may contain terms common 
experience english web queries average terms long 
simple measure similarity computing cosine terms queries coarse lead zero values 
example consider fragments captain kirk star trek 
clearly fragments semantically similar captain kirk fried chicken simple term cosine score give zero value cases 
generalizing problem define real valued kernel function arbitrary text fragments 
importantly note utilize external resources search engine order determine similarity score perform query expansion results define represents search engine 
generally remains constant define respect just parameters mehran sahami search engine compute cosine expanded queries 
formally qe denote query expansion text example define qe centroid tfidf vector representations top documents returned search engine response query define cosine qe qe 
obtain results kernel function anecdotally showing efficacy captain kirk spock captain kirk star trek captain kirk fried chicken web contextual kernel function obvious utility determining semantic relatedness text fragments harnessing vast quantities text web open research issues remain 
example research help identify effective text expansion algorithms particularly suited certain tasks 
various methods statistical dispersion measures clustering identify poor expansions cases text fragment may expansion encompasses multiple meanings expansion michael jordan including terms researcher basketball star 
retrieval usenet articles visible document collections context general purpose search engines usenet archive conservatively estimated documents 
usenet archive ignored traditional academic ir exception newsgroups data set text classification tasks extremely interesting 
usenet started loosely structured collection groups people post 
years evolved large hierarchy groups topics ranging sex 
ir context usenet articles raises interesting issues 
case web spam constant problem 
web clear concept home page usenet 
example canonical page queries ibm digital cameras 
previously explored possibility address retrieval usenet stage ir problem find relevant newsgroup find relevant document newsgroup 
may appear simple scheme consider fact newsgroups contain token ibm 
leads problem determining canonical newsgroup having ibm highest level comp ibm pc group subgroups underneath comp sys ibm simply group 
questions arise moderated newsgroups weight newsgroups big portion usenet hierarchy considered credible portions 
article posting level similarly rank just content relevance take account aspects articles normally associated web pages temporal information posting thread information happy searcher author article article quotes post proportion quoted content proportion original content recognizing certain postings may faqs flames aid determining appropriate ranking article 
lines previous research examined building models newsgroups communication patterns message threads language models indicative content 
questions remain go factors build effective ranking function display results effectively users 
furthermore attempt compute inherent quality credibility level author independent query pagerank web 
computation operate graph relatively modest size example filter authors posted twice year newsgroup left order authors 
manageable size web graph nodes 
computing community structures pure linear structures posting threads generate interesting insights various authors groups participate influence discussions 
comprehensive studies bulletin board postings similar usenet project 
examined characteristics authors posting patterns identifying characteristics people start discussions people flame people cross post multiple newsgroups people spam people terminate threads filtering technologies context information retrieval focused attention building better models content messages routing appropriate people bringing user modeling ir text analysis 
advantage working usenet archive fact alleviates infrastructural problems slow research web domain building html parsers properly handling different languages character sets managing exceptional volume available data small web require gigabytes store 
older usenet posting archive previously available cd roms making archive relatively easy store index process single machine 
researchers started looking smaller scale problem culling information bulletin board postings trying ascribe quality level information contained 
example zilberstein analyzed postings slashdot bulletin board discussion forum technology savvy readers attempting learn moderation system 
slashdot moderators assign genre label informative funny score indicating view relevant posting score label pairs challenging task rich structure domain author information posting content thread history predict label score new postings 
generally improving ranking methods usenet bulletin board postings open area research interesting similarities web significant differences fascinating subject study 
mehran sahami fig 
results obtained searching google images cars retrieval images sounds proliferation digital video cameras camera phones audio recording devices mp music rapidly increasing number non textual documents available users 
challenges faced quest organize useful world information process contents non textual objects indexed 
equally important line study focus user intuitive methods query access information 
difficulties addressing problem non textual object retrieval best illustrated example 
shows results obtained searching google image repository cars 
note diverse set content related cars 
results see different car poses pictures cars billboards cars barely visible snow cars hand drawn illustrations 
addressing sort diversity presently give basic approaches task retrieving images music 
happy searcher 
content detection images method means individual objects image detected possibly segmented recognized 
image labeled detected objects 
music method may include recognizing instruments played words said sung determining artists 
approaches furthest adequately realized involves signal processing 

content similarity assessment approach attempt recognize content images audio clips 
attempt find images audio tracks similar query items 
example user may provide image audio snippet types results interested finding low level similarity measures spatial color histograms audio frequency histograms similar objects returned 
systems find images sunsets blue skies applied task finding similar music genres 

surrounding textual information common method assigning labels non textual objects information surrounds objects documents 
example images web documents wealth information evidence image contents 
example site image appears example adult site site music groups tv shows image referred image filename surrounding text provide potentially relevant information image 
approaches course conjunction provides fairly diverse set benefits drawbacks 
example surrounding textual information easiest method susceptible misclassification image content due errors malicious web site designers 
content similarity assessment provide indication image content rarely able practice find particular objects particular people 
content detection method attempts recognize objects scene building detectors arbitrary objects time consuming task usually involves quite bit custom research object 
example studied object detection domain date finding faces images continued improving quality decade 
systems detect people just finding faces cars progressing extending arbitrary objects focus significant amount research 
assigning labels images variety topics addressed deciding images user 
example multiple copies image 
near duplicates 
eliminating near duplicates involves comparing images find identical copies developing automatic methods ignore insignificant variations due compression formats scanner calibration error small corruptions files 
topic addressed order mehran sahami images 
ordering better 
relevance page images play factor order assessment 
looking ideas extended video retrieval 
combining audio track videos images displayed may provide additional sources information index video provide tremendous amount noisy training data training object recognition algorithms en masse 
harnessing vast quantities data variety research topics discussed previously scratching surface myriad issues ai technologies address respect web search 
interesting aspects working web data insight appreciation get large data sets 
exemplified banko brill case word sense disambiguation practical example briefly discuss experiences different contexts google spelling correction query classification 
spelling correction 
contrast traditional approaches solely standard term lexicons spelling corrections google spelling corrector takes machine learning approach leverages enormous volume text build fine grained probabilistic context sensitive model spelling correction 
allows system recognize far terms standard spelling correction system especially proper names commonly appear web queries standard lexicons 
example standard spelling systems suggest text mehran sahami corrected completely ignorant proper name simply suggesting common terms small edit distance original text 
google spelling corrector attempt correct text mehran sahami term combination recognized highly granular model 
interesting fact employing context sensitive model system correct text mehran mehran sahami common english word edit distance sahami fine grained context sensitivity achieved analyzing large quantities text 
query classification open directory project 
open directory project odp dmoz org large open source topic hierarchy web pages manually classified 
hierarchy contains roughly classes topics 
useful source hand classified information sought build query classifier identify suggest categories odp relevant user query 
blush appear standard text classification task 
challenging consider documents classified user queries average length just words 
set classes odp larger previously studied classification task classes non mutually exclusive happy searcher create additional confusion topics 
despite challenges available roughly pre classified documents giving quite substantial training set 
tried variety different approaches explored different aspects classifier model space independence assumptions words modeling word order dependencies word queries generative discriminative models boosting 
complete list methods compared included portions study conducted iterative piecemeal fashion direct comparison methods applied data possible provide 
various algorithms performed expected relative previously published results text classification training data set sizes small 
interestingly steadily grew amount data available training reached critical point algorithms generally indistinguishable performance 
interesting fact moved substantially critical point adding training data na bayes minor modifications take account confidence associated classification separate model single word queries outperformed percentage points accuracy algorithm employed substantial effort placed making better 
furthermore probability smoothing techniques generally help limited data situations showed appreciably improvements decreased performance data rich case na bayes 
set alternative algorithms means exhaustive results somewhat anecdotal hypothesize case banko brill study abundance data usually weaker modeling techniques 
perspective unusually implies training data simpler obvious solutions better complex models attempt compensate lack sufficient data points 
web information retrieval presents rich varied set problems ai techniques critical advances 
number challenges giving admittedly brief overview approaches taken problems outlining directions 
result hope stimulate research area vast amount information web order better achieve goal organizing world information making universally accessible useful
