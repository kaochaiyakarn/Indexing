quest low latency nelson fabio kon department computer science university paulo kon ime usp br low latency processing usually goal real time audio applications clear little latency considered low 
discuss currently available experimental data human perception argue somewhat high latencies ms probably perfectly acceptable typical musical applications 
argue possible accept various levels latency system aware effects latency users system need experimental data latency perception able better assess effects latency musical applications 
experiment suggested 
interactive systems adequate latency jitter characteristics determined interaction user high latency jitter may impair user performance offer frustrating experience 
order assess quality interactive system regarding latency jitter characteristics need understand effects user perception define maximum acceptable values parameters system 
acceptable limits latency jitter interactive system may vary lot 
interactive multimedia applications usually require lowest latency jitter values usually involve continuous media may modified user interaction 
multimedia systems differences acceptable limits latency jitter human hearing higher time precision vision time precision involving different stimuli types visual auditory auditory tactile usually lower temporal precision stimuli kind 
higher timing precision hearing relevance music control latency jitter important part design systems computer music

latency jitter discussed lot known perceive lack experimental research enables understand better various tradeoffs latency jitter human performance perception

kind jitter directly related way interactive aspect system discussed 
timing may affect perception timbre comb filtering tight wessel wright 
comb filtering effects occur situations original sound mixed corresponding delayed sound sounds reasonably similar instance sound ordinary acoustical instrument sound processed order increase high frequencies 
cases ordinary latencies real world environments may produce comb filtering effects suggests effect may largely ignored situations timbre may altered timing differences low ms order capture need guarantee sufficiently high sampling rate jitter level 
see jitter values close relevant scenarios suggests trying achieve low levels jitter trading added latency usually strategy 
outside extreme examples problem latency jitter usually problem perceived synchronization may prevent perceiving events appear simultaneous 
turn may affect interaction system

fact strong indications performers introduce variations performances musical context bilmes 
experimentation suggests rhythmic perception comparison expected actual time sound attack schulze hypothesis reinforced fact precision tracking rhythmic variations significantly affected tap phase 
turn means perception rhythmic variations ms auditory cues related slight differences attack moments close sounds 
high precision regarding rhythm means able assess time intervals attack times ms precision subconscious level discrepancies magnitude may affect feel kinds music steady isochronous pulse forms pop music 
strong point case trying minimize jitter possible computer music system kinds music supported 
synchronization external events tempting conclude precision perception means need guarantee events perceived simultaneous happen ms asynchrony 
ms supposedly simultaneous notes uncommon ordinary music performance 
fact horn sections orchestra may farther audience violin section results ms public ordinary instruments 
chamber music ms common 
similar way dynamic differences voices pieces piano responsible called melody lead notes melody played ms supposedly simultaneous notes spite percussive characteristic piano sound results short attack times distinguishable attacks perceived performers audience 
subjects asked tap stimulus virtually tap ms ahead time typically ms debate effect reflection dynamic differences voices introduced performer order highlight melody line 
research leaves little doubt effect consequence dynamics perceptual effect melody lead effect appears minor parncutt 
noticing 
facts suggest latencies responsible external events ms may considered normal acceptable circumstances music performance traditional instruments impaired 
fact ear strong cues identification simultaneous tones 
may argued consciously perceptible may musical role partly control performer fact just mentioned responsible better tone discrimination 
apparently musical role exists minor perceptual experiments showed little impact variations artificially induced parncutt performers apparently high precision controlling note 
stems influence tactile kinesthetic usually called haptic sensations accompany action 
synchronization haptics brings interesting aspect latency jitter multimedia music applications perception latency user action corresponding reaction 
respect perception shows high degree precision shown variations feedback delay ms consciously noticed compensated manner adjust tapping slightly disturbed beat sequence wing 
reasonable expect similar mechanisms involved cases fact mechanism involved subjects create expectation moment time feedback detect feedback disturbance try compensate 
spite similarity situation elements stake matters complex user motor commands user corresponding haptic sensations relation external feedback 
elements important strong evidence suggesting moment recognize moment start external feedback widely influenced factors including haptic sensations form feedback 
means events happen simultaneously may perceived asynchronous subconscious level 
mentioned subjects typically tap stimulus ahead time 
amount anticipation dependent characteristics auditory haptic feedback 
auditory feedback produces perfect synchronization haptic feedback produces reasonably large anticipations forms feedback produce relatively small anticipations normal haptic feedback combined delayed audi tory feedback produce anticipations grow accordance amount delay prinz mates 
excluding special cases auditory feedback measured variations ms auditory feedback delays zero little ms subjects proved show little variability due previous training 
anticipations tend decrease contexts sound data beats 
variations give indication note onsets cues tone discrimination role musical expression probably limited 
important aspect fact adjust performance compensate different feedback conditions 
experiments delayed feedback subjects clearly altered behavior characteristics trial forcing researchers introduce control trials pair trials prinz mates 
piano performance time elapsed pressing key corresponding note onset ms piano notes ms forte notes jansson 
assume expects note onset happen middle course key latencies different different dynamic levels 
problem dealing different latencies voices pieces piano usually dynamics change continuously performer opportunity adjust corresponding changes latency 
abrupt changes dynamics usually related structural aspect music brings large interpretative timing variations 
modern music may dynamic changes fit interpretative timing variations music usually clear steady beat making effects sudden variations latency perceptible 
fact motor system react instantaneously issue motor commands ahead time order perform time hard believe various feedbacks actions calibrate ahead time commands issued 
tapping experiments latencies ms adjusted resulting final stimulus response variations ms mates previously stated believe irrelevant 
hope able argue convincingly somewhat large latencies ms pretty acceptable multimedia music applications 
jitter hand bigger problem generally possible trade jitter added latency 
mean lower latencies interest quite contrary latency different parts system accumulates 
instance mere positioning loudspeakers distance user adds ms total perceived latency system dsp algorithms add significant latency aiming lowest possible latency part system helps keep latency control 
tradeoffs acceptable 
currently available data insufficient determine clearer limits latency jitter confirm said musical context making difficult assess quality musical multimedia applications regarding temporal precision 
current research music timing perception non musical stimuli 
timing tightly tied aspects music feel part timing perception occurs outside consciousness need experiments performed actual music 
experiments face technical challenges new dealt bilmes 
example experiment small ensemble subject different feedback latencies assess effect 
repeated feedbacks provided loudspeakers artificial reverberation
