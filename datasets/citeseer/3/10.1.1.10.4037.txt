category induction tasks considered introduced osherson 

task specific inference task subjects asked rate strength arguments form horses get disease cows get disease dolphins get disease premises state specific mammals catch certain disease evaluated states specific species dolphins catch disease 
second task general inference task subjects asked consider generalization specific premises property mammals 
instance seals get disease dolphins get disease mammals get disease previous models similarity models 
osherson model expresses strength argument linear combination components term representing similarity premises term representing extent premises cover lowest level taxonomic category including premises 
formalizing ideas strength argument set premises category free parameter similarity metric lowest level taxonomic category including similarity metrics tried 
osherson propose maxsim consider maxsim maxi sim xi yj sim xi yj 
defined terms sim standard pairwise similarity metric assumed primitive 
similarity approach offer principled reason preferring metrics 
osherson suggest maxsim conforms better intuitions standard models inductive learning categorization memory 
show maxsim fits experimental data better offer possible explanation success 
bayesian models 
heit tenenbaum considered bayesian approaches category induction 
assume working finite domain 
tasks modeled domain set mammal kinds 
interested concept picks subset objects 
examples concept mammals get disease hypothesis space set possible concepts domain 
animal types distinct subsets animals logically possible concepts 
hypothesis assign prior probability probability concept interest 
osherson task may formalized follows 
observe set examples concept want compute probability object member summing hypotheses 
equals zero independent 
step follows bayes rule 
numerator equation depends likelihood prior 
assuming examples sampled independently random yields examples belong denotes size number instances extension 
denominator equation computed summing hypotheses 
osherson general inference task formulated similarly 
probability members category belong 
piece missing bayesian framework specification prior probabilities calculated 
heit address question tenenbaum prior distribution deeply motivated theory domain 
describe principled method generating prior distribution 
theory model prior distribution bayesian model motivated principles taxonomic principle distribution principle principles form theory distribution biological properties 
taxonomic principle holds animals naturally fall tree structured taxonomy collection hierarchical groups 
belief may universal 
substantial body documented cultures world organize living kinds folk taxonomies 
scientifically sound theory evolution implies living kinds conform tree structure 
step generating prior distribution build folk taxonomy mammals domain 
osherson collected similarity ratings pairs animals domain ratings define distance measure sim 
perform average link clustering assigns animal cluster proceeds repeatedly merging closest clusters 
tree produced shown 
distance measure defined terms similarity approach depend critically similarity primitive 
measures distance example represent animal set behavioral morphological features lives water tail set distance animals distance feature vectors 
structured domain knowledge obviate need bottom clustering 
building taxonomy similarity preferred approach osherson similarity data yields important payoff study allows performance model directly compared performance similarity models 
gorilla horse cow elephant rhino mouse squirrel dolphin seal taxonomy built similarity data simple prior distribution generated taxonomy 
nodes tree animal type internal nodes specifies concept includes animals falling beneath tree 
straightforward way set prior assign uniform probability concepts zero probability possible concepts 
call model uses prior taxonomic bayesian model taxonomic model simple corresponds roughly informal accounts taxonomically driven induction 
see adequate compare argument seals catch disease horses susceptible seals cows catch disease horses susceptible second stronger taxonomic model assigns rating set premises compatible hypothesis set mammals 
distribution principle second part theory states concept membership feature possession depends process random mutation operating taxonomy 
principle acknowledges convergent evolution occur animals may share property occurs common ancestors 
additional notation needed principle precise 
imagine membership concept learned depends single feature evolved point tree may evolved independently different branches tree 
arisen branch nodes falling branch members example appears points marked crosses include dolphins seals 
model evolution poisson arrival process free parameter called mutation rate 
poisson process assumes mutations arrive randomly potentially occurring point tree branch constrained respect rate 
probability feature develops branch length minus probability mutation arrives zero times branch develops 
branch marked develops branch 
obtain single estimate extension consider branches tree label marked unmarked equation collect external nodes fall beneath marked branch 
repeating times generates prior distribution possible concepts probability assigned concept proportion times chosen estimate prior distribution may computed analytically 
consider single branches tree 
branch calculate probability arises branch tree add probability prior corresponding concept 
continue considering pairs branches triples 
model evolution captures important intuitions 
develop longer branches tree 
second develops independently different branches probability arising branch small model favors simpler hypotheses hypotheses consisting fewer clusters 
alternative prior possible concepts considered tenenbaum 
compute disjunctions hypotheses represented folk taxonomy 
original hypotheses assigned highest prior probability disjunctions assigned somewhat smaller probability disjunctions hypotheses assigned smaller probability 
approach represents general strategy expanding hypothesis space applied hypothesis spaces taxonomies
