rapidly growing type communication internet instant messaging im internet relay chat irc 
primarily popular teenagers exploded adults quickly expected surpass electronic mail primary way people interact electronically year 
online chat provides mode talking keyboard mail real time human interaction telephone call 
fame im sparked ability stay connected associates friends family entertainment value meeting new people swapping files participation town hall style chat rooms discuss virtually imaginable topic 
unfortunately criminals migrated electronic chat homes lure children committing corporate homeland discussing terrorist plots 
instant messaging defined client peer peer chat discussion occurring small numbers participants 
client chat software revolves direct connections users central directory server broadcast availability client 
chat traffic broadcast centralized server central authority exists monitor enforce behavior 
popular im products include msn messenger yahoo messenger 
contrast im server chat takes place dedicated servers chat traffic transmitted server transmitted appropriate recipients 
irc server participants log client software 
server capable handling hundreds simultaneous users chat rooms

participants chat rooms engaged legitimate information exchanges chat rooms forum discussions dangerous activities 
detecting discussions associated terrorism illegal activities crime prevention abilities may enhanced 
example terrorist may looking recruit people cell child predators may attempting lure children 
automatically identify suspicious conversations individuals intelligence workers need archive online chat discussions sophisticated tools help filter process large quantity collected information 
human monitors actively watch decide chat concern law enforcement prohibitively expensive people participate chat system openly scrutinized human agents 
online chat provides new tool support criminal collaborations 
intelligence agencies need tools analyze archive suspicious subjects online chat obtained public chat rooms covert analysis february sampling chat networks indicates clients rooms clients rooms clients rooms 
people remain connected user base times larger 
chat data passing particular server packet sniffing 
chat sessions span days months agents need way recording tracking topics generated chat discussions analogous fbi analysis mail 
increased emphasis security issues september agencies benefit identifying suspicious electronic conversations automatically 
goal assist crime detection prevention automatically creating concept profiles summarizing chat session data 
created www ku edu system generate profile topics discussed particular chat room particular individual 
summary allows analysts focus attention people discussions profiles intersect domains national security interest 
example profile showing active participation topics bacteria cultures water reservoirs significant intelligence individual pursuing topic instruments disregarded investigating 
profiles created summaries individual privacy violated investigation session conducted requiring permissions 
discuss method profiling chat conversations search mechanism utilized depth analysis provide sample results data collected irc 
literature review topic identification text documents longstanding problem 
online chat structured differently written discourse poses new challenges classification systems 
chat sessions contain linear discussions single topics partially threaded interwoven topics oscillate short incomplete utterances topic detection difficult chat sessions 
studies started look current problems facing chat room topic detection monitoring 
chat room topics vary participants current interests impossible person know topics discussed chat room joining observe contents 
agent called butterfly aims resolve visiting rooms sample seconds data create simple term vector 
people searching chat topics request recommendations querying words interested represented term vector 
interest profile generated summing weights dot product vectors sum threshold chat room recommended 
limitation butterfly visits rooms see secret rooms considered useful interesting intelligence community 
mail messages typically threaded reply message grouped original message 
conversely chat turns taken participants 
response utterance may come minutes spoken opening potential confusion large number people 
looks automatic techniques discovering threading retrieving material streams data 
topic detection tracking aims discover tracking topics new events 
segmentation find boundaries topics followed logistic regression combine probabilities obtained language model built concatenated training events 
topics clustered determine new events pre existing ones 
news events test data reasonable suspect chat utterances may provide sufficient keywords 
additional studies techniques borrowed text classification may assist threading chat utterances 
comprehending interests interactions participants chat rooms create profile individual behavior 
uses metaphor creating individual visual data portraits represent interactions users 
data portrait combines attributes user activity utterances spoken rate responses relationships users groups users avoiding outsiders 
attributes timing utterances responses initial chat vs reply included portrait change time represent temporal view 
garden metaphor represents group groups visually compared indicate interactions differ dominating voice democratic group equal participation 
topic classification requires domain expertise concept 
ibm developed chat room archives web pages mail queried knowledge specific domain 
provide intelligence agents means assembling bodies knowledge concepts national security interest terrorist organization 
evaluated text classification techniques na bayes nearest neighbor support vector machine find suitable methods chat log classification assist automated crime detection 
training data limited categories limiting topic distinctions law enforcement analysis 
looks topic identification chat lines news sources complexity pursuit 
algorithm separates interesting components time series data identifying underlying hidden topics streaming data 
authors report results complement queries topic segmentation tracking methods text streams

exploration chat sessions interest facilitated providing search parameters keyword speaker listener date time 
combination automatic topic identification chat exploration provides intelligence agents tools need fight crime reducing efforts required manual review chat room conversations 
associated automating temporal analysis chat room topics 
sudden changes interests profiles indicate odd behavior brought attention investigator analysis 
example sudden change chat room profile discussions public water facilities flagged review 
profiling individual users benefit indicating interests analyzed sudden shifts topic 
due informal nature non english text chat messages right back loud preprocessing may help extract meaningful words seemingly meaningless chatter 
hope provide investigators ability retrieve replay chat sessions chat archive topics bomb making specific words pipe bomb 
chat topic classification applications outside intelligence community 
examples include parents wish restrict monitor types messages children send receive proactively block dangerous messages topic corporations review look unusual chat topics employees chat network providers identify rogue predators children forward chat data proper authorities 
questionable chat rooms identified administrators searching violations server policies 
consider factors metrical habits rhetorical devices words identify authors include user profiles chat nicknames change time 
example priority investigation chat logs collected utterances supposed child demonstrating vocabulary language model adult 
users adult language models sessions child language models may indicate child predator identified manner
