background common types auctions english auctions vickrey auctions 
people familiar english style auction bidder attempt 
typically winner bidder highest price pay amount equal value 
english auctions commonly real estate 
vickrey auction lesser known auction type allows bidder secretly submit bids 
winner bidder highest price pay amount equal second highest price highest losing bids 
vickrey auctions come online auction settings due simple communication computational complexity compared english auctions 
usually classify auctions sealed open bid single double 
sealed bid auction requires bidders seal bids submitting auctioneer 
able view values bids 
vickrey auction sealed bid auction 
open bid auctions allow parties view values bids 
english auction open bid auction parties need know current highest bid 
single auction auction buyers seller

security sealed open bid auctions share similar goals

briefly discussed security cdas 
anonymity security cdas limited coverage 
wl scheme specific conducting secure cdas preserving anonymity bidders 
achieved requiring bidder register entities share information bidder 
entities issue bidder auction certificate submit bids cda 
entities knows bidder real identity knows bidder 
allows parties learn information bidder 
time parties observing auction proceedings create profile particular bidder 
doesn reveal identity bidder provides information trading behaviour bidder 
entities observe auction proceedings create profiles manner entity knows bidder real identity immediately discover corresponding bidder submits bid 
furthermore scheme enforce payment address securities market aspects cdas 
believe problems resolved means 
allow bidders randomly choose number submit bids 
effect obscuring bidder trading behaviour bidders 
require bidders register auctioneers compute bidder threshold cryptography 
bidder remains anonymous long threshold auctioneers collude registration 
payment enforced digital cash protocols 
describe new scheme wl suggested properties 
threshold cryptography traditional scenario cryptography allows sender encrypt message send receiver eavesdropper observing message decipher 
order sender receiver require secret key 
threshold cryptography case sender receiver organisation individual 
case require organisation auctioneer sign individual bidder certificate 
ensures auctioneer learns signs bidder remains anonymous 
digital cash digital cash cfn previously auction schemes enforce payment fr vbd 
digital cash scheme main parties buyer bank merchant 
buyer obtains cash bank spend anonymously merchant 
merchant receives cash take bank obtain funds 
online cash scheme requires merchant interact bank sale offline scheme requires interaction 
scheme uses digital cash enforce payment prevent repudiation bids 
scheme propose anonymous non scheme threshold trust 
bidder issued multiple identities auctioneer submits bids independent market manager runs cda 
bidder free participate cda identities order prevent profiling 
main criteria striving achieve unforgeability forge bid order frame impersonate bidder 
non repudiation bidder having bid 
public verifiability validity bid publicly verified auction participants verified having followed protocol correctly 
robustness invalid bids failures protocol affect auction outcome 
anonymity cda identity bidder remains secret bidder associated bid submitted 
non party form profile bidder bidding strategy past bids 
preliminaries main parties involved bidders auctioneer market manager 
explain roles parties describe process cda scheme operates 
bidders belong set fb bidder public private key pair pu pr auctioneers belong set fa assume threshold auctioneers trustworthy collude bidder assured remain anonymous 
role auctioneer compute auction certificates bidders 
auctioneer jointly computes random pn public private key pair pr bidder 
addition auctioneer provides input group signature pra pn pu forms auction certificate 
bidder able request different public private key pairs auction certificates participating cda 
auctioneer public key denoted market manager mm responsible running cda 
includes accepting bids bidders determining auction outcome auction rules 
mm controls public bulletin viewed 
bids relevant statistics posted bulletin 
similar public bulletins previous auction schemes sm 
mm public key various differences cdas operate compared conventional auctions english vickrey 
major difference cda continuously running 
means need explicitly start auction proceedings 
bidder registers free participate auction 
addition conventional auctions usually allow bidder submit bid cda allows indefinite number bids submitted 
furthermore conventional auctions allow winners cdas allow multiple winners 
results complicated auction rules 
bids referred cleared price buy bid equals price sell bid 
example buy bid sell bid match clear bids 
matching strategies possible buy bid exceeds price sell bid
