problem description summary approach data web usually included html pages correspond pre established schema 
human user understand data page impossible machine 
extracting data web pages agents requires knowledge structure contents web pages 
mainly approaches deal problem data extraction web pages approach relies natural language processing nlp 
known current nlp accurate powerful recognize contents unrestricted web pages 
approach limited domains second approach tries associate web page semantic markers tags created 
example may personalized markers 
limitations approach known markers personalized hardly generalized 
original data structured different ways necessary restructure common model independent information sources 
approach idea 
particular focus data extraction semi structured web pages constantly changing data fixed structure stock exchange quotes 
approach ontology model data extracted 
data web page converted xml mapped data model 
definition data model mapping done manually 
automatic process carried perform real extraction task 
final result xml document contains standardized data set 

characteristics data sources exploitable information sources context may classified categories structured semistructured unstructured 
information source structured query information predefined query language 
database knowledge base typical examples structured information sources 
information source semi structured contains structure allows querying querying language databases 
considers source semi structured information retrieved formal grammar 
html pages web forms languages text description examples semi structured sources 
source unstructured form standard organization precise relations data 
difficult extract data unstructured sources 
extensive nlp required result uncertain 
aim extract information sources 
want extract information semistructured structured sources 
task easier growing number sites offering semi structured structured data 
successfully extract information sources great amount useful information exploited agents 
intend deal kinds data available web 
fact part sources submitted automatic data extraction provide dynamic data regular updating stable structure sites provide exchange rates 

related data extraction literature considers process data integration mediator user requesting information information source 
mediation process allows client obtain data caring data identity data storage data structure data access 
key data integration enables transparent access interface sources 
mediation included data integration 
necessary condition accessing source standard syntactic semantic description source 
information source refer system provide type data 
structured sources means transform conceptual schema source source accessed 
new structure provide explicit declarative description 
declarative description tries identify possible ways query source 
ways correspond different views relations constructed data source 
type description information brokers 
explicit description source contents described related 
systems kind description infosleuth sims usually domain model covers application area 
semi structured unstructured sources model created system

model understandable elements system 
creation model transformation necessary semi structured unstructured source 
ariadne graphic interface help users indicate data extracted web pages 
ariadne uses techniques machine learning generate extraction rules examples 
graphic interface help user identifying data extracted ontology extraction process 
approach different 
uses proper description language represent identify data inside html pages 
xml documents templates extracted data stored relational database

user specify metamodel ontology 
consider types objects entity attribute relation constraint

attribute attribute corresponds property characterizes entity 
relation describes links objects model entities attributes
