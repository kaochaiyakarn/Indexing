fast olsr protocol olsr optimization pure link state routing protocol concept multipoint relays mprs 
mprs reduces size control messages declaring links node declares set links neighbors mprs 
mprs minimizes flooding control traffic 
mprs sender forward control messages 
technique significantly reduces number retransmissions broadcast control messages 
olsr provides main functionalities neighbor discovery means hello messages second topology dissemination means topology control tc messages 
olsr ad hoc network node moving fast neighborhood changes quickly default hello frequency olsr sufficient track node motion 
routes node inactive messages sent node may lost 
higher hello frequency overcome problem cost additional control overhead 
proposed extension olsr address issues fast mobility 
fast olsr main objectives induced control traffic tuned node mobility way allows fast node motion tracked control traffic increases mobility 
second band width consumed control traffic remain reasonable 
basic idea fast olsr enable fast moving node quickly discover small number neighbors 
neighbors small number mprs selected maintain connectivity nodes network 
achieve fast moving node establishes small number symmetric links refreshed high frequency means fast 
links called fast links high frequency determined refreshing period fast hello interval default value hello interval 
node select maximum number mprs number called max default mpr 
fast link refreshed fast neighbor hold time considered broken 
neighbor discovery fast olsr operates main procedures switching fast moving default mode node detects moving fast high number changes neighborhood switches fast moving mode starts sending fast vice versa 
establishing fast links node fast moving mode sends fast hello messages high frequency 
fast hello smaller hello 
refreshing fast links detecting new broken links fast links refreshed sending periodic fast 
mpr received fast hello hold time fast hello interval considers link broken sends tc message inform nodes network longer mpr selection multipoint relays fast moving node partially knows hop neighborhood 
necessary simplified heuristic select set mprs denoted mpr 
set neighbors default mode reply fast selected mprs called candidate set denoted 
selection mprs computed follows initially mpr 
receives fast hello containing address node default mode mpr

heuristic enables broken fast link recovered quickly fast neighbor hold time 
avoids useless changes mprs cardinal mpr equal max default mpr detects new candidate node candidate selected mpr long mprs valid
