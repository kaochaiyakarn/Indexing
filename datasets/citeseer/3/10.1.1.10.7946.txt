hallmark modern managerial professional communication intensive 
managers professionals spontaneous communications multiple individuals course single day order scan environment exchange information influence request provide advice 
observers consider informal spontaneous communication exchanged managers professionals highly functional provides workers fresh rich information need jobs 
functional view workplace communication dominated research chi cscw 
early example research projects attempted extend benefits spontaneous communication distributed groups 
unfortunately informal spontaneous communication comes cost interruption 
modern communication technologies including electronic mail instant messaging pagers wireless email devices cell phones communication convenient increased sources interruption 
empirical research demonstrates costs associated interruptions workplace 
example fieldwork demonstrates software engineers exchange substantial help workers constant interruptions set back production schedules 
see frohlich 
interruptions managers think important issues extremely short blocks time 
generic problem disruption compounded target receive unequal benefits 
frohlich kraut demonstrate gains interruption incurs cost 
awareness displays designed encourage communication minimizing disruption associated interruption displaying target current state 
displays revealing information potential communication partner serve function 
example participants field trials media spaces full frame video images members workplace time drop available busy meeting phone 
minimalist availability displays away messages instant messaging systems serve function 
kraut demonstrated lab displays successfully coordinate communication minimize disruption associated interruptions 
designers assume mere presence awareness display cause potential regulate communication state potential target 
posit displays useful motivated concerned disruption may cause target interruption 
close friend refrain calling dinner 
empirical study described goal understand conditions awareness displays successfully coordinate communication 
experiment varies amount information display reveals target communication communicator motivation minimize disruptions 

controlling interruptions previous dominant technique control disruption provide target interruption filtering technologies control volume nature incoming communication

mcfarlane study interruption illustrates problem 
participants played jumpers game primary task 
video game goal save virtual people jumping burning building 
participants periodically interrupted jumpers game secondary matching task 
participants interrupted performed poorly primary task 
performance improved allowed control timing interruptions 
control interruptions failed respond large fraction 
interruptions come person messages judged important gotten delayed 
mechanisms synchronization deliver communication targets busy improve productivity help harming communication targets 
study software engineers described field experiment organization designated certain times day individual people couldn interrupt times interactive people interrupt 
synchronization mechanism positive effects productivity 
engineers managers appreciated regimen quiet times busy times able maintain 
eventually engineering firm reverted highly interactive highly crisis driven pattern communication 
may happened time synchronization attempt occurred temporally gross level 
required engineers unit postpone communications interactive period urgent question potential advisor free time 
researchers attempted build displays show potential attentional states targets 
displays allow individual communicators time interruptions targets idle states 
example hudson built visual indicators show talking revealing identity 
examples similar awareness displays include 
displays synchronize communication limited fashion encouraging communication regulating 
previous shows appropriate times task disruption interruption minimized 
example cutrell study experimenters interrupted participants sending instant messages various points searching list 
disruption caused interruption minimized interruption delivered search task 
mcfarlane experiment described participants best able handle incoming interruptions control timing suggesting individuals judge bad times allow interruptions 
implication research correct information worker properly time interruptions obtaining information need minimizing disruption cause
