mrml mrml originally developed separate retrieval engine user interface 
standardized access proved importance number applications 
detailed information mrml description applications mrml 
mrml xml standard freely available viper unige ch www gnu org software gift www mrml net parsers apache xerces 
mrml multi paradigm protocol offering features query example qbe choice databases features algorithms property sheets specifying algorithm specific parameters 
extensible private tags special features system easily specified sql embedded desired 
far number features supported mrml connection client server response server client capabilities configuration interface server needs query image example image browsing query text return query results urls relevance scores closing connection 
features practice shown utility client applications java php cgi 

example code mrml section meant replace mrml definition gives couple simplified code examples get idea mrml syntax 
helps group proposed changes mrml context existing definitions 

connection server connecting server simplest command ask certain properties server mrml get server properties mrml server informs client capabilities 
mrml server properties mrml connection user configure session transmit user name eventually password 
session opening reality user asks available collections server look mrml session id dummy session identifier open session user name test session name default session get collections mrml www com xml html xml apache org reply request collections look server database images collections available user mrml collection list collection collection id tsr collection name tsr cui algorithm id list id ail inverted file cui base dir databases tsr cui number images query paradigm list query paradigm type inverted file query paradigm list collection collection list mrml similar simple messages client request list collections available server descriptions ways queried query paradigms 
client open session server configure needs user interactive client needs 
benchmarking server 
client request algorithms collection mrml get algorithms collection id collection mrml request answered sending corresponding list algorithms available collection 
handshaking mechanism allows interactive clients programs meta query agents automatic obtain information describing server 

interface configuration client request property sheet descriptions server 
varying algorithms different relevant parameters user configurable 
feature sets speed vs quality 
viper example offers weighting functions variety methods pruning 
parameters irrelevant search engines 
mrml property sheets interface adapt specific parameters 
time mrml specifies way interface turn data xml send back server 
short example interface configuration property sheet property sheet id sheet type numeric numeric numeric numeric step features evaluated send type attribute send name cui percentage features specifies display element allow user enter attribute features evaluated 
values user able enter integers inclusive 
value sent attribute 
cui percentage features 
mechanism allows complex property sheets send xml text containing multiple elements 

query formulation query step dependent query paradigms offered interface search engine 
qbe taken essential example mrml browsing queries tests done region queries mrml 
basic qbe query consists list images corresponding relevance levels assigned user 
example user marked images image jpg positive user relevance image jpg negative user relevance 
query images referred urls 
mrml session id transaction id query step session id algorithm id algorithm default user relevance list user relevance element image location viper jpg user relevance user relevance element image location viper jpg user relevance user relevance list query step mrml server return retrieval result list image urls similarity scores 
thumbnail url transmitted show results screen faster way 
mrml session id acknowledge session op session id query result query result element list query result element calculated similarity image location viper jpg thumbnail location viper thumb jpg query result element calculated similarity image location viper jpg thumbnail location viper thumb jpg query result element list query result mrml queries grouped transactions 
allows formulation logging complex queries 
may applied systems process single query variety algorithms split screen version system described 
important cases preserve logs knowledge queries logically related 

version control mrml essential point mrml new elements added protocol affecting old programs know attributes 
unknown attributes simply ignored 
important add elements way old functionalities affected new elements known 
new versions mrml essential stay compatible older versions clients servers interact new features available applications 
especially big change structure done simple 
suggestion explicit version control certain session 
session completely done version defined 
version control allows client server stay compatible number eventually different versions just different dtd document type definition xml schema 
implement easy way think mrml server read generic dtds different versions control elements version chosen session definition 
possible automatically generate error messages missing elements badly formed queries requests 
element version number opening session mrml mrml version session id open session user name test session name default session get collections mrml version number needs transmitted communication phase 
version number linked session number 
system wishes change mrml versions new session needs opened 

proposed security features thinking adding database management functions mrml things apparent necessary identify user certain access rights login password 
important encrypt communication mrml moment completely open socket human readable xml 
care needs taken respect log files visible parts contain important information passwords users 
eventually steps secure architecture need taken 

user management access rights far possible send passwords mrml feature time 
data stream human readable currently extremely sense security standpoint communication completely safe environment 
user management contain global rights granted root user gift system configuration file 
users groups arranged superuser possible add certain rights users known system password match 
necessary grand simple query access database web demonstration example 
levels access seen 
respect creation deletion entire databases document collections second respect operations allowed particular database collection 

creating deleting databases right create database needs granted system administrator creating certain user 
creator decide wants give right delete database users wants keep right 
rights owner respect querying adding deleting images database detailed section 

operations existing databases operations created databases exist mrml querying database 
mrml server needs selection databases transmit user access right security settings databases 
actions need separated access rights database execute queries multimedia objects 
images form database submit new objects queries add objects database delete objects database start generation new index current objects 
submission new multimedia objects queries default disabled mrml interfaces gift query engine 
configuration depending user access rights intelligent 
simple element server right user client tries feature error message send server 

encryption big parts important encryption 
files contain important information log files communication password files user log user access rights needs protected read system super user 
need encrypt entire communication takes place mrml 
possible encrypt parts communication course better entire flow communication secure channel ssl 
server example serve encrypted encrypted clients depending operations needed 
help improve downwards compatibility 
projects datagrid able help security infrastructure middleware distributed data storage access 

database management database management function necessary queries distant clients addition deletion images done different computers 
case commercial applications content image retrieval systems applications hosted application service providers 
applications case integration gift document management system cern medical case database images 
applications need image server machine clients machines 
clients need able submit new images database regularly update feature file accordingly 

creating deleting database visual documents command create new database look example 
takes account information creation database extracted default values directories files example 
mrml session id create collection collection id collection name test cui algorithm id list id ail inverted file query paradigm list query paradigm type inverted file query paradigm list document list document location viper pics jpg document list create collection mrml sourceforge net www ch example document list optional 
case empty list database created empty structures set 
list images transmitted generation inverted file started message manually 
deletion database mrml syntax simpler mrml session id delete collection collection id collection name test mrml normally id database sufficient add collection name security feature avoid deleting accident 

adding removing images databases addition new images done mrml session id add document collection id document list document location viper pics jpg document list add document mrml addition documents necessarily generation index file consequence 
generations index files done step invoked command 
allows add images regularly generates index new images 
course started mrml message needed 
deleting images done similar way mrml session id delete document collection id document list document location viper pics jpg document list delete document mrml generation feature file automatic needs started corresponding mrml command 
take care delete images thumbnails generation inverted file 
invalid urls transmitted images thumbnails 

generation inverted file generation index file certain database invoked easy command 
system test new generation necessary case start scripts build inverted file 
mrml session id generate inverted file collection id mrml server side case simply executables gift exist generating inverted file 
care needs taken respect updating configuration file inconsistencies 

demand list images entire communication including database functionalities done mrml necessary couple commands useful 
example important able ask urls certain database 
request currently possible gift starting random query large number images sense transmit urls additional information thumbnails case format close adding deleting images 
asking list urls certain collection mrml session id demand document list collection id mrml response server respecting access rights similar mrml session id response document list collection id document list document location viper pics jpg document list response document list mrml commands necessary infrastructure 
possible command ask information specific database name owner access rights specific users
