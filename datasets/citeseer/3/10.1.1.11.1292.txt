argumentative approach assessing natural language usage web corpus 
spite significant evolution spelling grammar checkers word processing software problem judging appropriateness language usage different contexts remains large extent unsolved 
presents novel argumentative approach providing proactive assistance language usage assessment basis web linguistic corpus 
defeasible argumentation system determines expression ultimately acceptable analyzing defeasible logic program encodes user preferences 
expressions assessed unsuitable inspected automatically help user necessary repairs 
motivations spelling grammar checkers word processing software helped significantly reduce amount burden checking documents problem judging appropriateness language usage different contexts remains large extent unsolved 
effective solution problem provide user information frequencies natural language expressions different contexts 
systems called concordance programs particularly powerful evolution web huge collection text information available online 
linguistics called language usage patterns aim analyze natural language expressions means surveys different kinds classifying language patterns possible criteria 
surveys carried adequate samples sizes representative performing statistical inference assessing evaluating features language usage 
principle concordance programs provide frequency results obtained thousands web documents form called web language corpus just web corpus 
absolute frequencies natural language expressions source valuable information user performs measured analysis 
consider example journalist requires assessment particular expression news report 
fact high absolute frequency web documents imply acceptable regionalism belonging particular country
