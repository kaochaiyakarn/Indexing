research indicated misuse intelligent tutoring software correlated substantially lower learning 
students frequently engage behavior termed gaming system behavior aimed obtaining correct answers advancing tutoring curriculum systematically advantage regularities software feedback help learn similar students engage behaviors 
machine learned latent response model identify student gaming system way leads poor learning 
believe model useful re designing tutors respond appropriately gaming understanding phenomenon gaming better 
growing interest motivation students intelligent tutoring systems student motivation affects way interacts software 
tutoring systems highly effective assessing skills student possesses tailoring choice exercises student skills leading curricula impressively effective real world classroom settings 
intelligent tutors immune motivational problems plague traditional classrooms 
observed students intelligent tutoring classes motivated students traditional classes students misuse intelligent tutoring software way suggests ideal motivation 
study students frequently misused tutor software learned students tutor properly controlling prior knowledge general academic ability 
intelligent tutors respond differences student motivation differences student cognition proposed may effective current systems 
developing intelligent tutors adapt appropriately students depends creation effective tools assessing student motivation 
different visions motivation role intelligent tutors resulted distinct approaches assessing motivation 
approach increased student motivation seen goal create enjoyable motivating intelligent tutoring systems 
order desirable richest possible picture student current motivational state instance de vicente pain developed model classifies student motivational state axes 
alternate approach focuses motivation factor affects learning improving motivation viewed primarily means improving learning 
investigating motivation fashion hinges determining motivation related behaviors strongly affect learning understanding assessing specific behaviors motivations 
instance mostow colleagues identified students take advantage learner control features reading tutor spend majority time playing working repeatedly re read stories know heart 
motivation related behavior help abuse student quickly repeatedly asks help tutor gives student correct answer student attempts problem 
koedinger determined seeking help attempting problem negatively correlated learning worked develop model student help seeking give feedback students help effectively 
study category strategic behavior termed gaming system includes motivation related behaviors discussed 
gaming system behavior aimed performing educational task systematically advantage properties regularities system complete task thinking material 
students study engaged types gaming system help abuse systematic error 
investigated phenomena observing students class periods students tutor lesson scatterplot generation methods adapted past quantitative observational studies student task behavior traditional classrooms cf 

student behavior observed number times course class period 
students observed specific order determined class began order prevent bias interesting dramatic events 
observation student behavior coded categories working tutor talking task talking task silently task instance surfing web inactive instance asleep gaming system 
student frequency gaming strongly negatively correlated learning correlated frequency task behavior task behavior significantly correlated learning suggesting types low motivation equivalent effects student learning 
evidence study neutral gaming harmful hampering learning specific skills gamed merely symptomatic non learning goals cf 

understanding students game system essential deciding system respond 
ultimately remediation approach chosen costs benefits 
instance preventive approaches changing interface widgets difficult game delaying suc levels help prevent rapid fire usage may reduce gaming cost making tutor frustrating time efficient students 
students help effectively seldom game system costs approach indiscriminately may higher rewards 
whichever approach take gaming system success approach depend accurately automatically detecting students gaming system
