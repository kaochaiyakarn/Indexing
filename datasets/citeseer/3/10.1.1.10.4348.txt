called persona effect describes phenomenon life interface agent positive effect user perception computer interaction task 
previous empirical studies rely questionnaires evaluate persona effect utilize bio signals users order precisely associate occurrence interface events users autonomic nervous system ans activity 
report results experiment mathematical game suggesting interface character affective behavior may significantly decrease user stress 
describe character job interview scenario user affective state derived physiological data projected back mirrored user real time 
measuring effect interface agent focus employing character medium reflect user emotional state concept potential emotional intelligence training medical domain especially healthcare 
animated agents life characters start populating interfaces numerous computer applications impact human users largely unexplored general formulation 
context educational software lester identified persona effect refers credibility motivation enhancing effects character interfaces ii positive effect animated agents users perception learning experience

experiment positive effect animated interface agent subjective measures entertainment perceived difficulty supported technical information significant effect objective measures interaction comprehension recall shown 
mentioned studies rely questionnaires evaluation method allow precise temporal assessment particular behavior agents responsible perception 
propose take physiological data users interaction character interface evaluation method 
bio signals shown indicative affective state users may gain new insights concerning subjective measures persona effect 
recorded history users bio signals enable precisely relate ans activity user computer interaction state track impact agent behavior 
furthermore bio signals questionnaires evaluation methods may detect possible discrepancies interaction perceived user factual physiological state user 
promising results experiment sparked interest reflect effect interface persona user direct way allowing user inspect arousal real time 
emotion mirror web application depicting job interview scenario 
arousal level users inferred ans activity interview mirrored employing life character embodied mediator experienced stress relaxation states 
current demonstrator system fairly simple allows gather valuable experiences generation emotional intelligence training systems healthcare applications
