ontology integration describe integration ontologies problem merging ontologies single unified ontology 
addition representing information ontologies integrated ontology describe relationships 
practice merging ontologies complex multi layered difficult automate task 
possible problems include example terms name different ontologies representing different concepts 
ontology term president may mean president country may express president 
related problem different terms represent concept different ontologies ma mob represent large organized group criminals 
problems crucial ontology integration assume simplified setting different terms different ontologies represent different concepts terms single common meaning 
setting attempt integrate consistent ontologies expressed dl knowledge bases new ontology 
basic procedure assuming necessary pre processing taken place take union knowledge bases 
clearly new ontology may consistent 
typical action smart algorithm merging aligning ontologies indicates put conflict conflict list actions remedy inconsistency 
useful 
may reasons having inconsistency inconsistency arose fact certain axiom general preferred axiom applies general ontology exceptions specific ontology extreme case axiom ontology may just wrong defeated 
foregoing problems relatively easily solved placing preference order axioms ontologies 
ontology learning algorithm table encountering inconsistency suggest orders remedy inconsistency 
designer decide order choose modeling 
smart algorithm designer able adapt parameters partially automate behavior 
example integrating ontologies greater authority comes trusted source axioms preferred ontology preferred 
things explicit take look toy example 
consider little ontologies representing knowledge nixon quaker acknowledges fact nixon republican 
paci sts paci sts ontologies consistent right attempts unite knowledge new ontology paci sts paci sts ends inconsistent knowledge base 
specifically nixon shown pacifist non pacifist 
reason ontology preferred example released government unauthorized nixon website means incorporate preference simply defining preference order axiom claiming axioms authorized source preferred 
new ontology paci sts paci sts deduce preferred model semantics nixon pacifist 
directions research provided nonmonotonic extension shoq description logic imposing strict partial order axioms 
way able express knowledge caught rigid rules rules may valid general situation exceptions preferred rules override general case 
preferred model semantics provides natural way express situations 
discussed order learning algorithm inconsistent knowledge base suggest orders solve inconsistency
