opinion information filtering method trust provides new method filtering information 
main idea consists thinking agents personal entities rely 
reliability expressed trust value agent labels neighbors 
agent set friends uses filter information 
agent sure recommendation just discovers new item asks opinion reliable agents uses trust values conclude item interesting user 
call new process filtering information agents opinions opinion information filtering method 
differs typical collaborative filtering approach way agent ask recommendation agent ask opinion 
opinion interest agent thinks user item 
opinion directly recommendation agent includes reasoning combines agents opinions order decide recommending item
