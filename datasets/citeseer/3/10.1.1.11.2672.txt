user modern operating system linux experiences simple file system model 
particular file system provides access current versions files directories 
trouble model user progress monotonic user mistakes discarding important text document damaging carefully tuned source code misunderstanding accidentally deleting files directories 
mistakes helpful especially writing code papers look history changes file 
user go back time wayback machine file system named example better position recover mistakes understand file got current state 
course version control systems rcs rcs cvs cvs provide functionality 
user familiar systems explicitly manage files 
particular user tell systems new version files ready explicitly committing 
user determines granularity versions explicitly tend large 
tools emacs include drivers automate process 
applications mi wayback machine dr time machine classic cartoon series improbable history ted key 
word provide internal versioned file format 
versioning usually done automatically granularity editing session 
believe better way help user revert earlier versions file automatically provide versioning file system provide fine granularity

user view wayback fs wayback fs requires linux kernel gcc higher perl 
kernel versions early shipped red hat 
fuse user level file system module versions 
current wayback distribution shipped fuse source 
compilation involves typical gnu sequence

change logged reversible 
old versions copied

notice possible mount directory hierarchy path new versioned file system

versions tagged ways change number starting change time stamp 
user uses time stamp natural revert extract file directory existed particular point time 
implementation wayback fs implemented user space server called fuse kernel module 
essence fuse traps system calls upcalls wayback server 
server writes entry undo log file directory reflects revert effects call executes call underlying file system 
log structure files file versioning information exists shadow undo log file named default filename 

version 
log record consists time stamp offset data overwritten truncated size data lost file size increasing due writing file data lost 
logging file operations wayback traps calls write truncate files 
time write called file reads portion file write call overwrite records log 
offset recorded offset file data written size number bytes file number bytes written whichever smaller data size bytes offset currently file 
truncate called file offset recorded length file truncated size number bytes file point data data discarded due truncation 
log structure directories directory shadow undo log call directory catalog 
directory catalog logs entry directory created removed renamed attributes change 
directory catalog default name directory 

version 
log record consists time stamp operation performed size data recorded operation data needed undo operation 
interpretation data depends operation 
logging directory operations mkdir creat called link created open called creat flag directory catalog updated create mkdir operation number data consisting filename created 
unlink called regular file file truncated zero length preserve contents file deletion 
directory catalog updated data consisting attributes file mode owner times filename deleted 
links destination recorded 
calls rmdir wayback translate calls rename 
directories deleted contents lost 
identifier 

deleted added directory name 
subsequently user initiated rename calls directory catalog updated data consisting old name file directory new name file directory 
chmod chown utime called directory catalog updated data consisting attributes file filename attributes changed 
design issues encountered issues designing implementing wayback 
solutions decisions defined wayback 
kernel versus user level major decision file system implemented kernel file system user level module 
trade offs speed ease implementation features 
kernel module undoubtedly faster user level overhead avoided 
limit compatibility certain kernel versions preclude adding versioning existing file systems 
harder implement kernel module 
main factor decision user level file system features easily implement 
considered writing wayback extension ext 
probably faster limited ext file systems normal block devices 
implementing wayback user level file system slower file system versioning 
choice undo logging wayback logs changes undo records 
recover previous versions applying records reverse order appropriate version reached 
straightforward downside reverting newer versions fast reverting old versions take time 
alternative redo log modifications written log records 
recovering old version means applying records forward order appropriate version reached 
advantage allowing old versions recovered quickly newer versions slow 
third possibility undo redo log contains undo redo records allowing move backward forward easily 
logging technique combined periodic checkpointing providing snapshots file state move forward backward log 
chose simple undo logging wayback felt cases reverting mistakes editing programs documents typically move backward small number versions 
light applications support see reconsidering logging model 
fuse decided user level approach considered interact kernel 
time started development fuse early stages started fuse able avoid kernel development altogether tempting wanted concentrate versioning mechanisms 
fuse kernel module provided level access needed modern linux kernel 
fuse proved relatively stable easy 
early versions fuse provide upcall close system call 
lack impossible create new versions close vms 
fortunately determined write level versioning 
indirectly affected wayback design 
particular close calls managing file descriptors log files unnecessarily difficult 
path redirection deciding fuse quickly came issue 
fuse designed provide destination path file system source path mount 
examples fuse entire directory structure root directory provide root different source memory 
decided wanted redirection path just root directory implement 
wayback takes different command line arguments fuse file systems modifies arguments passing fuse 
information arguments modify path wayback fuse redirecting real path
