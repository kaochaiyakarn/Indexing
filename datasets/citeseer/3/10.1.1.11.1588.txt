current prototype enables focus issues 
describes results trials set users versed realms landscape architecture city regional planning urban design 
goal sessions observe skilled users employed constructive capabilities 
users actions comments influencing second version prototype developed 
findings users concerned issues representation scale 
person commented element symbols images available specifying illustrations elements street level scenes 
users wanted options greater detail specifications flexibility applying 
affordances users wanted construction manipulation stemmed experience drawing imaging tools 
keyboard functionality supplement mouse save undo functions object alignment layering facilities topographic mapping 
features panning zooming requested controlling view scale capability sizing elements merely selecting available sizes 
interestingly implicit notion layering initial version prototype user control 
implementation strategy keeping track elements specifications 
example landmark originally represented generic triangle specific tower staircase 
furthermore preferred sequence moves initial layer containing element symbols layer containing specifications placing viewing walkthrough 
users process complexity relatively crude stage implementation 
adopting object oriented strategy new version simplifying implementation constructive process 
users designate change element specifications time 
spite difficulties users managed create interesting designs improving representations construction process main goals new version prototype 
construction screen changed substantially version shown left currently developing shown right 
notably longer separate construct represented button left street level scenes generated paths 
change simplifies constructive process better reflects lynch conceptualization paths structural feature 
furthermore miniature copy user map reflects construction lower left screen 
miniature maintained street level scenes mark proceeds paths software displays corresponding series scenes 
map navigational aid providing conceptual link users constructions generated environment 
clear delete undo save get quit functions easily accessible elements appropriately sizable fuller range detail specifications images represent elements street scenes specification process consistent element element 
implications graphical virtual environments emerging potential broad learning entertainment 
interactions environments stem text virtual environments participants exchange messages create extensions domain constructing characters objects spaces 
constructive particularly important learning environments designed materials help learners focus thinking specific concepts affordances enable engaging working concepts 
text environments typically associated programming language enables interactions 
constructive component easily transferred graphical domains 
tools developing images tend complex requiring professional expertise order produce satisfying result 
need develop readily usable tools support constructive interactions graphical multiuser environments 
suggests basis designing structural features virtual environments 
meant complement facilities designing features architectural social aspects 
tool learning research 
prototypical form tool provides affordances learners investigations topological relationships 
tool include studies form spatial reasoning implementations multiuser platforms 
immediate goal complete aims pc prototypes including development sounds characterize flavors districts nodes
