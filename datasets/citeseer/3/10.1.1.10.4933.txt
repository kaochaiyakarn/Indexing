communication agents needs flexible encompass variety different aspects conformance society protocols private tactics individual agents strategies reflect different classes agent types personal attitudes adaptability particular external circumstances time communication takes place 
propose argument framework representing communication theories agents take account uniform way different aspects 
show approach realize existing types dialogue strategies society protocols way facilitates modular development extension flexible handling different special circumstances 
communication main features multiagent systems 
society protocols regulate communicative behaviour agents conform defining dialogue moves legal situation 
private strategies adopted individual agent specify dialogue move agent willing utter objectives personal characteristics 
ideally dialogue moves selected agent strategy fall legal moves defined protocol 
investigate represent communication patterns argumentation framework dynamic preferences 
behaviour agent participating dialogue conditioned theories framework expresses preference policy dialogue moves 
theory captures society protocol describing legal moves levels normal default exceptional preferred moves current set circumstances society agent belongs 
context dependent protocols afforded representation framework give high degree flexibility encompass uniform theory different aspects protocol different circumstances perceived different agents society share protocol 
second theory describes preference policy personal strategy agent 
influenced application domain tactics agent personal profile attitude characteristics 
society protocols theory context dependent order take account variety situations dialogue take place different roles interlocutors context dialogue dynamically changing circumstances dialogue 
decision move utter integration theories suitably exploiting sceptical credulous forms argumentation reasoning 
approach allows separation concerns professional tactics dialogue strategy personal attitudes strategy legality strategy decisions required societal protocols

examine turn different components 
basic component 
component contains object level rules language defining private dialogue steps agent form rj pj pi cij belong label set cij empty called enabling conditions dialogue step performative pi pj

rules names rj written logic programming style representing compactly propositional rules obtained ground herbrand universe theory

essentially simplifies attacking relation argumentation significant simplification purposes 
background knowledge base contains rules pj pi pi pi subject express general requirement different utterances incompatible 
means argument specific utterance potentially depending priority rules parts theory attack different 
admissible set arguments contain rules derive utterance 
fact basic component theory easily credulous utterance example illustrates 
example 
consider agent bob equipped basic component containing simplified rules

generally conditions rule specify normal conditions default preference applies

note component personal strategy theory change application application tactic agent may want apply different 
designer may hold different tactic components equip agent relevant depending application 
alternatively flexibility captured theory introducing suitable tactical conditions priority rules separate cases different applications

options obtained computing credulous skeptical strategy theory 
desirable theoretical property strategy theory dialogue move generated time 
framework guaranteed construction strategy includes rules making concurrent moves conflicting 
words admissible argument support different moves 
observe property called determinism similar frameworks semantics allow concurrent sets admissible arguments 
case non concurrency guarantee determinism usual sense 
instance credulous typically pick admissible argument random facing different alternatives may respond differently performative 
guarantee admissible argument exists need inspect conditions appear level strategy 
words need check strategy exhaustive sense conditions rules level satisfied 
coincide exactly existence reply move 
instance skeptical agent choose different candidate moves admissible arguments remain silent moves generated special utterance see indicating case dialogue terminate suspend information acquired agent 
way ensure notions coincide require complete strategy theory comprising components hierarchical form defined follows 
definition hierarchical policy 
agent argumentative policy theory hierarchical iff pair rules si sj incompatible exists priority rule assigns higher priority rules conditions si sj satisfiable background theory condition note definition rules si sj priority rules case rule priority rule higher level 
basically hierarchical structure prevents existence concurrent sets admissible arguments 
case course unique credulous skeptical coincide 
consequence non concurrency implies determinism implies existence 
leads result theorem uniqueness
