relevance feedback typically query expansion short term modeling user immediate information need user profiling long term modeling user persistent interests preferences 
traditional relevance feedback methods require users explicitly give feedback example specifying keywords selecting marking documents answering questions interests 
relevance feedback methods force users engage additional activities normal searching behavior

consider implicit feedback techniques query expansion user profiling information retrieval tasks 
techniques unobtrusively obtain information users watching natural interactions system 
user behaviors extensively investigated sources implicit feedback include reading time saving printing selecting
