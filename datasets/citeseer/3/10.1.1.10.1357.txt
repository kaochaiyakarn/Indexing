dynamic cache model describe content dynamic cache tables cache constraint definitions 
observing cache constraints guarantee result query obtained dynamic cache tables result query executed backend database modulo differences due cached data base date 
property correctness principle dbcache 
cache constraints help determine set dynamic cache tables query satisfy correctness principle 
tables called eligible cache tables query 
types cache constraints enforced dynamic cache tables cache key constraints defined columns cache table referential cache constraints involve multiple cache tables 
current prototype assume specify cache constraints 
plan automate task 
cache keys cache key cache table column values identify records cached cache table 
cache key unique values cache key column domain complete 
property guarantees value column cache table contains rows backend table contain value 
note unique columns primary key columns cache table domain complete definition 
cache key defined non unique column dbcache satisfies domain completeness property column fetching required records backend loading cache table details provided section 
single cache table domain completeness property guarantees correctness equality predicates form column 
case say eligible table 
cache keys explicitly defined system definitions clearly state intention trigger ondemand loading missing cache key values 
shows ddl template create cache key dynamic cache table 
alter table dynamic cache table name add cache key column name adding cache key dynamic cache table referential cache constraints developed type cache constraint guarantees correctness equi joins cache tables 
basically define new relationship type cache tables specific cache database 
domain completeness property determine set eligible cache tables answer queries involving single table equality predicates described previous section 
query includes cache tables participating equi join predicates determine eligibility 
need additional information tells cache table eligible equi join 
developed notion referential cache constraints address requirement 
perspective semantically different referential integrity constraints 
demand loading mechanisms described section enforce referential cache constraints populating cache tables 
cache system guarantees keep correlated values cache tables consistent 
referential cache constraint rcc defined columns cache tables depending join operation possible 
rcc creates cache parent cache child relationship cache tables 
rcc column cache table cache parent column cache table cache child indicates value includes rows having value column 
row associated row may may exist 
note parent child relationship completely cache specific sense defined join processing point view 
illustrate suppose equi join predicate backend tables cache tables respectively cache parent columns know eligible cache table local query plan short safe execute join cache database 
shows example ddl template create dbcache 
alter table dynamic cache table add cache column name dynamic cache table column name ddl adding referential cache constraint cache groups dbcache term cache group identify set related cache tables content directly transitively populated values cache keys single cache table called root table 
tables cache group reachable root table rcc constraints called member tables 
cache group notion helps organize cache tables way recognize application contexts easily explained section detect potential problems caused conflicting cache constraint definitions 
cache table contain cache key root table member cache group 
cache system populate cache table 
rare case cache table populated manually due unique primary key columns 
cache database cache group may completely covered root table member cache group 
cache groups may overlap sharing member tables 
note cache groups implicitly constructed cache constraints declaratively specified 
respect cache group concept different introduced 
represent cache group directed graph called cache group graph nodes denote cache tables edges denote 
direction edge rcc cache parent cache child table 
graph may contain bi directional edges indicating columns cache tables directions 
row cache table requires having corresponding rows table 
unidirectional path formed source table target table graph directions set 
participant table traversed path 
path start table 
path called cycle 
note bi directional edge corresponds cycle 
cache keys represented graph annotations node representing root cache table 
underlined cache keys denote non unique cache keys

example gold customer cached predicate system guarantees gold customers orders orderline rows cached benefiting join queries involving tables 
issues cache constraints uncontrolled cache constraints cause unexpected amount data loaded cache database 
causes severe performance problems population maintenance problems system cache invalidation 
unexpected cache load occurs recurring load operations cache table 
call phenomenon recursive cache load problem 
extreme case problem cause loading entire content backend table 
cache group called safe setting cache constraints cause recursive cache loads cache tables 
sections address unsafe conditions define set rules exclude cache group 
dangerous paths cache group graph easy see cache group graph contains cycle danger recursive cache load participant table 
safe condition prevents recursive cache load problem cycle single column participant table traversal 
cycle called homogeneous cycle 
note bi directional edge creates homogeneous cycle 
hand heterogeneous cycle formed path participant tables contains columns traversal 
shows different examples cycle type 
heterogeneous cycles pose potential recursive cache load problem precondition allowed 
set rule exclude cache group definitions rule cache group graph include heterogeneous cycles 
note example recursive cache load problem isn heterogeneous cycle 
table cache child column homogeneous cycle heterogeneous cycles cycle examples cache group graph rcc order location product manufacturing location 
allowed new row loaded table corresponding rows having loaded 
new row may load new row due new rcc 
may turn force load rows new row requires corresponding rows 
result may repeat operations extreme case may load entire tables 
implications domain completeness property domain completeness property provides key functionality correctness equality predicates complicated situations may arise semantics 
particular enforcing domain completeness property non unique columns cache table may lead recursive cache load problem 
dbcache cache table column explicitly defined domain complete 
implicitly domain complete conditions satisfied 
column unique primary key column cache key defined column column involved homogenous cycle column column cache table participating cache table contain cache key defined column 
address domain complete columns created direct consequence definition 
theorem shows domain complete columns result 
theorem columns involved homogeneous cycle domain complete 
proof suppose homogeneous cycle cache group graph including cache tables cache table populated set rows having set values 
column value table populated rows having column domain complete 
similarly populated rows containing values 
making domain complete 
eventually newly loaded values 
cause populated rows including values column making domain complete 
example column table involved homogeneous cycle domain complete 
note domain completeness property created different sense column coexist domain complete column 
words domain completeness property destroyed cache table contains new column 
example columns table domain complete 
absence column remaining rcc domain complete cache table limit number domain complete columns long unique 
non unique column domain complete 
explain restriction needed assume non unique columns domain complete cache table 
insert set rows cache table specific value cache key column satisfy domain completeness property second column may load sets rows backend new value second column 
new rows may force round loads satisfy domain completeness property column 
result satisfying domain completeness columns unmanageable extreme case may loading entire backend table 
result rule cache table rule cache table non unique domain complete column 
domain completeness properties caused irrelevant rule columns unique domain complete columns coexist explained 
order enforce rule domain complete columns may created allow situations model cache table having non unique cache key 
cache table having non unique cache key time having non unique columns involved homogeneous cycles 
cache table having non unique columns involved homogeneous cycles 
new cache constraint created system addition violate rule 
issues selectivity non unique cache keys important factor usability dynamic caching 
cache keys chosen low selectivity columns gender system forced load large amount data dynamically 
general better declarative cache tables cases 
planning develop cache advisor tool setup cache key constraints query workload
