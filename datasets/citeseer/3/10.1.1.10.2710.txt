provenance documents order realize annotation linking provenance documents needed things 
export provenance documents cohse environment extract xml documents mir 
prepare ontologies annotating documents related web pages 
annotate documents concepts drawn grid ontology 
acquiring ontology grid generic domain specific ontologies annotating provenance documents 
generic ontology mainly includes concepts organization users publishing providing general linking provenance documents links related users executed workflows relationships organizations research topics 
oiled man ac uk domain ontologies include concepts bioinformatics services grid workflows biological concepts coming grid ontologies 
acquiring annotations provenance logs produced associated explicit concepts 
enactment engine intended general purpose engine 
required post annotate documents corresponding concepts manual annotations deep annotation process 
manual annotation apply handcrafted annotations provenance documents 
scientist recognizes semantic concepts data services logs manually annotates data corresponding concepts 
authoring process quite time consuming 
automatic annotation need automatically automate provenance documents concepts 
semantic concepts services data provided ws info documents described section provide appropriate semantic mime type information workflow service inputs outputs workflow execution
