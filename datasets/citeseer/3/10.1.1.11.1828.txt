switchboard spontaneous speech produced native english speakers variety topics results shown table indicate clearly appropriate language model acoustic models important deriving best performance 
language model better match development data read english spontaneous english spontaneous accented error rate reduced 
accented data matches test language model wsj swb accent acoustic wsj model accent table word error rate models domain speaking style 
evaluations done non native speech acoustic models outperform evaluations wsj models 
re training acoustic models accented data results significantly accurate recognition performance gain 
appropriate language model effect gain

general trend suggests foreign accented speech acoustic models transferable language models benefit appropriate training data 
result differs transferring task domains native english recognition

reduced vowels foreign ac speech previous study prosodic features stress pitch accent may important factor performance asr system non native speech 
specifically showed heavily accented spanish speakers substitute full vowels speakers 
small study selected utterances showed heavily accented speakers errors word sentence stress lightly accented speakers 
previous experiments compare speakers native speakers 
experiment follow earlier finding looking difference spanish accented native speech deal full vowels 
order determine results generalized corpus avoiding having hand label stress patterns chose relatively simple dependent variable investigate vowel durations 
goal see spanish speakers full vowels stressed vowels places native speakers reduced vowels 
looked average duration hispanic english corpus compared average duration native speaker switchboard corpus 
determined average duration reduced vowels performing forced alignment phone boundaries 
subsequently normalized values average vowel duration accented native speech respectively 
ratio values calculated equation reduced vowel average vowel reduced vowel average vowel accented accented native native phoneme normalized accented native duration ratios ax axr ix table normalized ratios reduced vowels 
values greater indicate longer durations data switchboard data normalizing average vowel duration 
table shows vowels ax axr ix longer average spanish speakers native speakers normalizing length average vowel corpora 
results show speakers tend reduce vowels native american english speakers 
applied result recognizer hypothesis modifying lexicon acoustic models represent longer unreduced spanish speakers may play key role dealing accent 
fact longer unreduced fact spanish accented english fact accented speakers 
previous research suggests result applies spanish different languages different positions reduction scale 
example compares average word duration mandarin accented turkish accented speakers 
point mandarin accented speakers longer vowels average native english speakers turkish speakers average shorter vowels 
points korean accented speakers emphasize durational differences shorter ih longer iy presumably influenced fact korean distinction long short vowels 
subjects duration important aspect vowel identity 
previous studies directly address reduced vowels suggest non native speakers different language backgrounds apply different strategies pronouncing english vowels 
area clearly calls investigation 

discussion shown speech recognizer trained native english speech performs poorly spanish accented english training recognizer hispanic english drops error rate drastically 
accented data available training performed studies hope shed light native english recognizers eventually adapted accented english 
study showed acoustic models transferable native accented speech language models benefit appropriate training data 
suggests surprisingly possible acoustic training lm training key better performance accented speech 
second study confirmed earlier suggestions spanish speakers tended full vowels native english speakers 
current research hope apply ideas ways 
foreign accented acoustic data hard get hope try acoustic training data foreign language 
result points importance acoustic training data hope spanish training data help building acoustic models hispanic english 
second hope build modified hispanic english lexicon directly represents full non vowels hispanic english speakers
