confidence framework disambiguating geographic terms erik rauch michael kenneth baker massachusetts avenue th floor cambridge ma rauch com describe purely confidence geographic term disambiguation system crucially relies notion positive negative context methods combining confidence disambiguation measures relevance user query 
questions geographic term disambiguation standardly handled statistical framework example ask absence contextual information probability word madison refer person james madison organization madison guaranty savings loan place madison wisconsin disambiguation alternative exists expect numbers sum behave probabilities 
questions strictly probability framework appropriate 
particular information disambiguate spatial natural language text strongly non local character increase amount background information eventually reach point amount training data parameter low repeatable experiment base probabilities 
cases probabilities effectively stand really confidence judgment

clear decades artificial intelligence research automated general natural language understanding feasible 
able progress restricting effort defined domain geographic concepts statistical methods extremely large corpora

challenges finding geographic meaning natural language text natural language text geographic highly specified ambiguous 
take extreme example encountering task determine places world name referred place referred phrase means red arabic 
applies dozen towns named madison 
fact majority places ambiguous way 
human beings remarkable ability derive useful information ambiguous specified real world knowledge experience deriving fuzzy rules experience knowing apply 
imitates process combinations heuristics data mining 
example encountering mention human analyst may notice rest document focused region oman 
mention oman mention nearby place document oman referred 
place named iran towns oman close close iran 
people apply real world knowledge gained contexts know example place called madison absence state refer madison wisconsin smaller madison iowa know james madison madison family refer places 
similarly know refer place japanese town name government minister named mentioned 
information people disambiguate contained document form experience gained reading documents 
encountering name people various associations uses name seen rough idea referred places 
methods determining geographic meaning natural language able imitate aspects common sense process defined lowdimensional space geographic concepts 
gazetteer containing name point name region pairs enclosure relationship regions points 
name may refer points regions refer non geographic concept 
deal ambiguity potential name point estimate confidence really refers relevance document mentioned location determined order results best satisfy need correctness relevance query described section 
main phases processing involved extraction geographic information training large corpora real time processing document 
order index large volumes documents reasonable time documents processed rate documents second single workstation 
constraint affects choice heuristics 
methods determining geographic meaning real time processing described section 
training phase requires seed system capable extracting geographic information limiting case manually grounded documents 
quality training depends quality seed system real time processing documents improves iterate training process 
details training process described section 
real time processing documents identifying candidate places processing document identifying potentially geographic 
identify known candidates meaning 
example madison potentially mean points name 
main source geographic names high quality gazetteer 
see axelrod process building updating gazetteer 
procedure obtain realistic initial confidences associated gazetteer names described section 
mention alternative sources potentially geographic 
capabilities allowing match postal addresses pass third party geolocation software producing coordinate address 
coordinates matched 
match department army message traffic formats means 
matches assigned initial confidences disambiguated local non local information document 
geographic disambiguation local linguistic context similarly statistical nlp efforts local document context potentially geographic name occurs 
example words city mayor preceding words community college name madison strong positive indicators geographic nature name 
time words dr common name preceding words arrive potential city name strong negative indicators name question geographic 
mixture data mining procedures described section domain knowledge repositories containing context strings names form sets contexts determine strength positive negative indicators 
heuristics adjust confidence geo refers geographic location refers synonymous locations nature strength indicators 
local clues absence upper case letters name resemblance name acronym proven useful adjust values geo values geo modified non local information described 
geographic disambiguation spatial patterns geographic documents high degree spatial correlation geographic textual proximity 
applies points nearby madison milwaukee situation points enclosed regions madison wisconsin 
correlation geographic textual distance considered estimating confidence name refers point 
heuristics increase points enclosing regions mentioned document proximity 
characteristics nearby locations weight influence decreasing function geographic relationships textual relationships increased saturating function influences 
domain knowledge population heuristics addition population data gazetteer 
place high population mentioned place lower 
disambiguating multiple referents name population considered 
confidence place decreased amount proportional logarithm ratio population population places name relative discussed processing stand geographic 
process relative geographic miles northeast portland 
relative resolved correspondence disambiguation anchor portland 
decided portland refers portland oregon confidence assume miles northeast portland refers point miles northeast portland oregon confidence greater presence defined relative serves additional linguistic clue 
temporal information strictly geographic issue mention system extracts temporal information natural language documents

training determining geographic significance gazetteer names methods disambiguating geographic terms described exploited level corpus despite fact data training untagged noisy 
real time document processing system high throughput applied training corpus consisting documents 
name high confidence referring point refer absence evidence document 
name point pair initial confidence average confidence assigned instance training corpus

training process iterative 
data mining geographically significant local linguistic contexts currently data mining tagged corpora learn contexts geographic non geographic occur words phrases leading trailing name tagged corpora obtained alembic tagger day 
accumulated statistics allow determine specific context positive negative indicator term geographic strength particular indicator 
context adjustment applied confidence nonlinear function probability geographic occurring tagged corpus 
relevance addition geographic dimensions information retrieval means addition relevance documents textual query relevance places mentioned documents considered order rank documents 
kinds relevance traditional textual query relevance rw properly balanced return documents relevant user query 
traditional textual query relevance obtained standard techniques robertson jones 
geographic confidence place names place document map emphasis place name document 
emphasis affected position name document prominence function title header emphasized rendered large font clues related nature formatting document 
similar term relevance heuristics information retrieval robertson jones pattern emphasis geographic somewhat different 
function assigns emphasis component function document position somewhat different usually 
decreases maximum document low number near long document increases near bottom document account increased relevance information 
frequency name document considered similar way standard information retrieval techniques robertson jones 
emphasis function number geographic document 
assumption document unlimited amount relevance spend places 
place mentioned document relevant 
emphasis calculated multiplied obtain compute function location referenced document 
varies function character position document independent
