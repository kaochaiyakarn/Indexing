hits web cluster identification 
hits algorithm link algorithms proposed hits algorithm link analysis algorithms proposed identify authorities hubs web search results 
authorities defined web pages referred cited times hubs hubs web pages contain links authorities 
definitions authorities hubs imply sets web pages form structure similar bipartite graph directed links going hubs authorities 
denote graph representing hyperlink connectivity structure web site vertex set containing web pages site ele ments edge set containing ordered pairs vertices formed recording source destination hyperlinks 
denote authority score hub score vertex hits algorithm contains main steps step computing authority scores step computing hub scores note bipartite graph assumption sufficient necessary condition defining authorities hubs 
project description cluster dept overview cluster presentation slide cluster 
website dense bipartite subgraphs cluster candidates 
algorithm iterates step authority scores hub scores converge 
vertices high values computed authorities hubs respectively 
shown set converged values forms principle eigenvector adjacency related matrix 
resulting set web pages high authority hub scores corresponds bipartite subgraph cluster web site highest degree inter connectivity 

web cluster identification mentioned natural apply hits algorithm analyze summarize web sites applicability limited 
main reason hits algorithm assumes existence densely connected bipartite subgraph web site find information 
scenario seldom real web sites 
example common computer science department web site contain large numbers programming systems documentation archives java documentation unix commands glossary 
time relatively smaller important information staff projects exist 
direct application hits algorithm web site result computed authorities hubs biased densely connected information clusters document archives example mixture documents 
documentation archives identified 
obviously web site visitors expect types information order overview website 
see pictorial illustration 
issue multiple sets authorities hubs web search results pointed suggested causes mainly related nature query string polysemy multiple communities 
multiple clusters web site note due differences link semantics page context specific characteristics compared communities emerged web 
link semantics web sites web search results contain cross domain links 
main objective author create links crossing domain boundaries cite logically related web pages 
links web site intra domain objectives far diverse providing citations related topics tutorial page pointing important assisting web site navigation links pages previous pages home pages 
common web pages web site form large number densely connected subgraphs 
underlying clustering structure number clusters sizes degrees inter connectivity depends web site designers 
order words degree multiple cluster problem web cluster identification 
page context web sites due cross domain requirement expect application hits web search results sensitive existence polysemy resulting known topic drift problem 
contrary web pages web site context 
example university web site contain course information student information job mission statements press releases university context 
believe applying hits summarize web sites affected topic drift related techniques may relevant 
summarize main causes multiple clusters web sites include existence self referenced indexed hypertext document archives java sdk documentation presentation slides existence self referenced topics description project people home pages links showing inter relationship self contained archives topics navigation aids near root web site 
note causes result clusters deeper levels web sites normally higher degree inter connectivity 
form clusters higher level people reveal 
hints notion cluster hierarchy motivates recursive algorithm going propose 

recursive hits algorithm kleinberg studied possibility extracting principle eigenvector adjacency related matrix non principle ones logical clusters

consider iterative procedure approximation extraction non principle eigenvectors tractable 
currently studying theoretical link 
realize proposed idea number implementation issues needed carefully considered 
identified set authorities hubs just implicit representation clusters explicitly defining cluster boundaries 
need way infer boundaries hierarchical clustering possible 
second authorities hubs obtained round hits come mixture multiple clusters similiar degree inter connectivity 
essential separate different logical clusters 
lastly important extracted clusters properly organized subsequent visualization processing needs 

directory subtrees cluster boundaries obvious approach address aforementioned issues analyze local hyperlink structures extracted authorities hubs 
computationally expensive performance depends navigation hyperlinks designed 
rationale people tend put related materials far apart site directory propose utilize path information embed ded urls authorities hubs hope achieving goal 
scan authorities extract authority scores higher fraction maximum value 
extracted authorities grouped part paths overlaps
