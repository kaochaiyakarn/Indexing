previous considerable literature trees information visualization layout trees 
algorithms tree layout graph drawing point view summarized di battista 
forms trees information design information visualization point view surveyed bertin card herman 
simple static layouts tree layouts assume trees static concentrate methods layout trees meet aesthetic criteria minimal line crossings placing nodes tree depth level compactness 
simplest way lay trees lay uniformly see plate 
num ber nodes leaves subtrees computed multiplied amount space node plus spacing nodes subtrees 
method works small trees attempt portray tree moderate size say nodes start approximate appearance horizontal line width increases exponentially height increases linearly 
compressed static layouts sophisticated methods tree layouts developed spatially compact 
slide portions deeper subtrees underneath shallow subtrees 
example classic reingold layout refinements creates top reasonably compact tree satisfies various aesthetic criteria symmetry shape common subtrees 
tree space compressed recursive tree layout algorithms 
example trees lay branches branches forming 
ball trees layout branches spokes root branches spokes tips see herman 
containment trees tree layout algorithms discussed far node link diagrams represent trees 
trees represented containment example set nested circles 
class particularly interesting containment trees treemap 
treemap technique lower subtrees contained higher nodes tree 
space divided say vertically number sections equal number branches top level 
section divided horizontally number branches level tree 
division space continues vertically horizontally small divide 
algorithm allow room content non terminal nodes technique modified division extra space node contents 
advantage treemaps stay predetermined space bounds little room node content especially non terminal nodes aspect ratios nodes vary widely obscuring simple relationships attempts order visualizations mitigated effect 
interactive tree layouts techniques discussed far share problems components information visualization systems 
scale sufficiently 
tree plate nodes nearly unreadable 
compressed tree layouts adequately extend number nodes handled 
second literature tree layouts consider trees nodes contain significant information require significant amount layout space 
third techniques tree layout bounded space 
easily modular components information displays 
interactive trees handle problems displaying portion nodes time 
typical interactive technique apple hierarchical filing system 
level tree expanded individually clicking small triangle 
user expand portions tree compared screen keeping portions tree compressed eliding nodes compressed subtree root 
tradeoffs considerable manual manipulation performed user constantly adjust views guarantee tree fit leading manual manipulation scroll bars

user indicates interest node say selecting calculation performed display nodes threshold 
way display tree follows user changing interest 
limitation technique guarantee displayed trees fit display bounds 
technique especially problematic large number sibling nodes branch 
second class focus context techniques uses geometric distortion 
example hyperbolic tree 
visual transfer function defined distorts space area interest magnified expense nodes trees distance interest 
selecting node moves center side display 
nodes smaller closer 
display stays fixed boundaries 
limited number links focus node seen 
technique suited cases doi varies discontinuous ways tree limited number multiple foci 
variant geometrical distortion cone tree robertson 
cone trees arrange nodes tree 
selecting node rotates branch cone tree bringing related nodes foreground sending nodes background 
technique uses natural perspective occlusion achieve effect geometric distortion way user experience geometric compression distortion 
furnas fisheye view technique combined cone trees allowing display larger trees order nodes 
cone tree display nodes occlude 
class technique expanding focus context displays semantic zooming 
display zoomed nodes expanded past certain threshold content changes 
fox perlin technique pad system expand calendar seen sort containment tree 
mackinlay semantic zooming calendars spiral trees 
tree arranged spiral 
node tree expanded content semantically zoomed reveal additional structure 
higher level nodes center distant user perspective reduce size 
tree layout virtue stays confined fixed bounds user sees limited subset nodes tree essentially view looking upward tree root 
graham kennedy semantic zooming geometrical distortion display biological taxonomies 
final focus context technique cluster nodes far point focus 
nodes near point interest expanded constituent parts distant kept aggregate form
