ew exploited weakness deny service ddos attacks exploit different weaknesses deny service victim clients 
differentiate semantic brute force attacks called vulnerability flooding attacks literature 
ew semantic semantic attacks exploit specific feature implementation bug protocol application installed victim order consume excess amounts resources 
example tcp syn attack exploited feature allocation substantial space connection queue immediately receipt tcp syn request 
attacker initiates multiple connections completed filling connection queue 
cgi request attack attacker consumes cpu time victim issuing multiple cgi requests 
attack especially powerful attack tcp protocol 
initiates establishes numerous tcp connections consume connection queue victim 
bypasses tcp protocol stack agent machine keeping state connections originates 
participates connection inferring reply attributes received packets 
poorly provisioned agent machine easily resources better provisioned victim 
ew brute force brute force attacks performed initiating vast amount seemingly legitimate transactions 
intermediate network usually deliver higher traffic volume victim network handle high number attack packets exhausts victim resources 
thin line semantic brute force attacks 
semantic attacks overwhelm victim resources excess traffic badly designed protocol features remote hosts frequently perform reflector attacks dns request attack smurf attack 
difference victim usually substantially mitigate effect semantic attacks modifying misused protocols deploying filters 
brute force attacks due misuse legitimate services filtering attempts harm legitimate traffic due limited resources victim handle attack network bandwidth 
countering semantic attacks modifying deployed protocol application pushes corresponding attack mechanism brute force category 
example victim deploys tcp syn cookies combat tcp syn attacks vulnerable tcp syn attacks generate requests network accommodate 
classification specific attack needs take account attack mechanisms victim configuration deployed protocols 
noted brute force attacks need generate higher volume attack packets semantic attacks inflict damage victim 
modifying deployed protocols victim pushes vulnerability limit higher 
interesting note variability attack packet features header payload determined exploited weakness 
packets comprising semantic brute force attacks specify valid header fields possibly valid contents 
example tcp syn attack packets vary protocol flag field flood packets belong established tcp connection spoof source addresses 
hand attacks aiming simply consume victim network resources vary packet features greatly hinders defense 
sav source address validity ip spoofing plays important role ddos attacks

example reflector attack smurf attack 
sav ar non routable source address attackers spoof non routable source addresses belong reserved set addresses part assigned address space network 
attack packets carrying reserved addresses easily detected discarded packets carrying non addresses significantly harder detect 
spoofing non addresses enables researchers gain valuable insight ddos attacks backscatter technique :10.1.1.21.6570
sav st spoofing technique spoofing technique defines attacker chooses spoofed source address attack packets 
spoofing technique divide spoofing attacks random subnet en route fixed spoofed source address attacks 
sav st random spoofed source address attacks spoof random source addresses attack packets simply achieved generating random bit numbers stamping packets

ard constant rate majority known attacks deploy constant rate mechanism

ard variable rate variable rate attacks vary attack rate agent machine delay avoid detection response 
ard rcm rate change mechanism rate change mechanism differentiate increasing rate fluctuating rate attacks 
ard rcm increasing rate attacks gradually increasing rate lead slow exhaustion victim resources

pc characterizable characterizable attacks target specific protocols applications victim identified combination ip header transport protocol header values packet contents 
examples include tcp syn attack packets syn bit set tcp header potentially part attack icmp echo attack dns request attack pc relation attack victim services characterizable attacks divided relation attack victim services attacks 
pc attacks malformed packets packets non critical services victim operation 
filtered firewall 
examples attacks udp flood attack icmp echo flood attack web server 
web server needs tcp traffic dns traffic characterized permitting inbound udp packets dns replies previous outbound dns requests easily block inbound udp traffic icmp traffic operate correctly 
pc non non attacks formed packets request legitimate critical services victim 
filtering packets match attack characterization lead immediate denial specified service attackers legitimate clients 
examples requests flooding web server dns request flood targeting name server 
case non attacks contents attack packet indistinguishable contents packets originating legitimate client 
pc non characterizable non characterizable attacks attempt consume network bandwidth variety packets engage different applications protocols 
packets randomly generated reserved protocol numbers 
note classification attack characterizable depends strongly resources dedicated characterization level characterization
