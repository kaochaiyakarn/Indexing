getting increasingly popular consumers buy digital cameras take thousands photos daily life 
consumers simply dump photos directory analogous dumping developed prints shoebox 
typical user generates thousands photos year 
finding photo shoebox directory difficult

previous image browsing browsing interface simply shows thumbnails image shoebox directory 
user required click fetch desired image scanning thousands images impractical 
extreme deep tree search pichunter 
pichunter shows images step user scanning time insignificant 
number browsing steps large 
similarity pyramids prevent deep tree searches organizing entire database hierarchical quad tree structure 
similarity pyramids fast agglomerative clustering algorithm place similar images near level pyramid ensure image level similar images 
similarity measured image features 

autoalbum images albums image features cluster consumer photos may lead desirable results 
size shoebox directory gets large probability matching semantically dissimilar images high 
example image sunset image fire truck may placed cluster 
clustering algorithm may place semantically similar images different clusters making search longer difficult 
presents autoalbum combination clustering algorithm user interface helps consumer find specific photos 
autoalbum tradeoff generality performance

user interact results autoalbum way 
album representative thumbnail image displayed 
user step search albums 
representative image reminds user desired picture image similarity semantic similarity simply memory aid

clustering scenarios order improve clustering simply image features autoalbum uses metadata associated digital photography 
depending camera download method different types metadata digital photographs commonly preserved 
type metadata creation time date photo 
digital cameras save creation time photo 
circumstances creation time preserved data downloaded camera 
example directly reading flash card kodak dc preserves photo creation time 
clustering algorithm type metadata uses creation time ignores content image 
called time clustering 
clustering algorithm starts new album new photo taken certain amount time photo 
clustering creation time works extremely temporally related pictures semantically related 
second type metadata order photos taken 
metadata camera download method storage method preserve photo creation time 
example camera clock may get reset due dead batteries 
cameras pictures downloaded serial cable creation time file download time true photographic creation time 
creation time destroyed order photos preserved 
order deduced creation time file pc file name image sequentially generated 
difficult second case albums formed clustering content 
clustering obey order photos 
cluster contain contiguous set photos 
exploiting order photos significantly helps clustering 
agglomerative clustering distances image images considered 
set semantically related images fixed size database grows constant probability unrelated image closer image closest related image probability closest image semantically related decays exponentially database size 
ordered clustering distances images measured 
quality clustering independent database size 
time clustering content clustering albums images albums displayed order photos taken 
intuitive order corresponds order people normally store photographic prints 
time content clustering combined 
time clustering 
creation time preserved small semantic clusters produced 
large clusters produced 
large clusters broken contentbased clustering smaller clusters 

clustering best model merging autoalbum uses probabilistic clustering get best content clustering performance 
probabilistic clustering creates conditional density model image data probability generating image depends conditionally cluster membership image

baum welch algorithm fit hmm shoebox directory photos 
severe problem method 
applied autoalbum baum welch algorithm starts initial assignment photos albums improves assignment local maximum reached 
practice baum welch minor changes initial assignment produces unusable albums 
best model merging helps avoid problem local maxima stepwise merging adjacent clusters 
best model merging similar agglomerative clustering probabilistic works ordered data set 

best model merging applied autoalbum best model merging starts image having model 
merging pair adjacent models causes loss data likelihood combined model general fit data individual models

lz lx log likelihood album defined 
note change ajm due merge tiny compared change dja ignored 
best merging greedily merges adjacent models cause loss data likelihood 
merging repeated desired number clusters reached 
example average pictures album may desirable number clusters number pictures 
alternatively bayesian techniques may model merging 
high speed implementation omohundro suggests storing possible merges priority queue 
step best model merging priority queue requires log time current number clusters 
clustering images albums requires cpu seconds mhz pentium ii counting time compute image features 

autoalbum image generation model autoalbum assumes hmm state generates colors images corresponding album 
generated colors lower resolution original photo 
luminance images assumed come lighting conditions state variable 
model chosen empirically testing different models model gave content clustering closely matched time clustering data 
colors defined cie perceptually uniform color space 
generative model histogram space divided square bins bins side 
model bin chosen probability proportional stored histogram count color pixel color center chosen bin 
bins span 
bins span 
colors outside spans clipped nearest bin 
best model merging histogram statistics album kept increase speed clustering 
log likelihood pixels album histogram counts lx log histograms merged counts corresponding bin summed 
stage best merging image histogram model 
histogram initialized bins equal small value implies histogram estimate maximum posteriori estimate prior probability estimate uniform prior colors 
image downsampled lowest integer scale final width near pixels final height near pixels 
rgb pixel values converted histogram smoothed kernel 
pixel value downsampled image bilinear tent shaped kernel placed pixel value space 
kernel bin widths wide dimension 
histogram bins increased amount equal value kernel center bin 
example pixel value lies directly bin center bin increased bins changed 
pixel value lies exact center bin centers bin centers increased 
histogram counts interpolated 
interpolation histogram model insensitive small changes color slight changes pixel alters model slightly
