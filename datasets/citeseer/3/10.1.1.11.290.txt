society autopoietic systems open system needs input matter energy resources build components produce output matter energy form waste products heat 
spite open autopoietic system organizationally closed organization determined purely internally

autopoietic system contains knowledge organize network production processes 
closure means component system produced components system

requirement closure application autopoiesis social systems controversial 
closure distinguishes inside part system outside part environment

reduced friction effects control net result drive increasing efficiency matter energy information processed transported easily social organism

normally objects difficult move friction creates opposing force dissipates energy slows movement 
noise plays similar role information transmission noisy channels parts message get lost way

reach higher speeds sustain longer time running 
walking ice difficult potentially dangerous walking start slipping little movement getting control

applies unwanted movements 
easier distribute weapons drugs poisonous materials 
movement gets started develop quickly making difficult counteract time 
example infectious disease spread quickly world people travel frequently 
computer viruses modern variant principle easier faster exchange information computers quickly viruses spread 
reduction friction particularly dangerous self reinforcing processes 
typical example positive feedback process speculation stock exchange buying triggers buying causing boom selling triggers selling causing bust 
reason number processes low friction society intrinsically stable higher risk catastrophic outcomes 
led proposals artificially increase friction restrictions computerized trade imposition tax international movements capital 
hand reduced friction improves efficiency negative feedback cycles characterize regulation 
basically leads greater amplification control loop smaller error signals lead appropriate reactions quickly easily correcting deviation chance grow 
buying selling example may illustrate principle negative feedback supply demand normal market effective friction reduced prices come quickly supply increases demand decreases increase price readily trigger increase production fulfil unsatisfied demand

issues raised superorganism model noted view society organism elicited worries objections general questions need addressed 
discussion recurring issues allow argue global integration desirable fact inescapable 

control freedom 
common objection superorganism model people tend interpret disguised way promoting system 
especially words control collective evokes immediate associations individual liberties 
negative connotations may understandable wholly 
societal evolution sketched extrapolation existing trends show going increase freedom democracy decentralization decrease cf 
heylighen 
trends explained straightforwardly postulated mechanisms differentiation opens possibilities individual choose role education occupation reduced friction increases general freedom movement expression consumption increasing autonomy reduces need tightly control monitor individual activities 
complementary mechanism integration seen source new constraints limitations restrict freedom powerful individuals dictator baron organizations abuse system ends freedom ordinary people realize individual ambitions 
global integration means increasing mutual dependency various organizations increasing difficulty organization dominate 
understandably resented power lose welcomed powerful 
example anticipated loss global superorganism power may explain common distrust global institutions united nations presently powerful nation usa 
historically regimes germany soviet union iraq result individual select group desire gain maintain power privileges expense larger population suppressing freedom question privileges 
underlying mechanism simply individual selfishness augmented social power structures cf 
heylighen campbell 
particularly modern social systems apart sophisticated methods control type centralized organization period french american revolutions 
insofar societies ideological political system soviet system different self organizing cybernetic organism system proposes 
discussed soviet valentin turchin soviet system lacked crucial component cybernetic control feedback 
distributed feedback loop constantly adapting changing circumstances soviet economy rigid mechanical top command structure little regard effect commands real world 
led known calculation problem central planning agency find impossible determine exactly shoes need produced satisfy needs population 
resulting economic inefficiency contributed eventual collapse soviet system 
emphasis distributed control meant imply centralization necessarily bad concentrating control knowledge separate subsystem number benefits heylighen 
main advantage giving control system explicit physical form open scrutiny improvement 
example control cell centralized dna nucleus 
easy evolution try new forms organization making small changes dna 
cell control distributed participating molecules assumed autocatalytic cycle models origin life kauffman flexible appears evolve complex organization 
similarly role society form government market mechanism solve problems certain intrinsic shortcomings speculative bubbles disregard externalities pollution corrected replacing components producers consumers 
market reacts steered outside system government imposes constraints regulations taxes subsidies participating actors cf 
heylighen 
advantage separate system function replaced different unsuccessful government voted global market 
absence centralization base nightmare vision associated superorganism model true collective everybody thinks room individual initiative decisionmaking 
vision inspired insect societies ant nests existing political systems 
popular instantiation borg race imagined creators science fiction series star trek 
cybernetic point view borg organization inefficient 
noted earlier ashby laws imply global organism order maximize control environment chances survival maximize capacity autonomous decision making components 
maximize diversity variety strategies heylighen components 
achieved stimulating individuals develop freely cf 
heylighen possible choose path merely conform collective point view 
ants shown colony efficient finding food individual ants merely follow paths laid fellow ants regularly deviate create path heylighen 
people understandably dislike analogy human societies insect societies insect societies organized intrinsically manner insects simply dumb creatures compared humans 
isolated insect behavior governed simple rigid rules intrinsically free creative insect living colony 
choose social individually living cousin 
bee fly 
alternatives particularly attractive 

conflicts shared values recurring issue brought forth superorganism model individuals groups agree part global system 
principle individual nation group nations refuse integrated social system 
individual level phenomenon existed practice living outside society 
phenomenon marginal remain 
principle reason social organism tolerate existence individuals small groups isolated really contribute society follow rules 
condition outsiders harm endanger inside may case criminals people mental disturbances 
practice people choose option 
benefits belonging society security comfort companionship knowledge medical support great difficult resist lure 
benefits increase superorganism develops 
hand common idea lose comfort dropping gain freedom misunderstanding freedom means 
technology social support systems life basically struggle survival energy time directed finding necessary food shelter 
removing requirements society real freedom doing want want time want having worry able survive 
especially technology transport communication systems enormously expanded freedom movement communication 
superorganism increases differentiation integration options choose occupation go want want 
course belonging encompassing system impose certain constraints aimed maximizing synergy interacting components minimizing mutual obstruction 
constraints generally reduce freedom 
may illustrated traffic code 
able travel car want great freedom people previous ages hardly imagine 
people drive safely minimum interference roads traffic rules followed 
rules speed limits self evident ways avoid danger self may largely arbitrary 
example intrinsic reason cars red light green light drive right side road global superorganism left 
arbitrary conventions useful ways regulating traffic everybody follows 
restrictions freedom drive side road prefer driving difficult dangerous effectively limiting freedom movement 
freedom lost rules compensated freedom gained fluid safe flow vehicles 
problem rules everybody agree follow 
content rules part arbitrary different cultures traditions tend evolve different rules cf 
heylighen campbell 
example cars great britain drive left side road cars parts world 
changing established rule difficult costly stressful resisted groups traditionally follow especially real imagined reasons believe rules superior 
global integration entails eventual rules free exchange goods services people information fluid possible 
implies reduction freedom certain groups governments set rules differ rules rest 
provides strong motive groups resist integration 
example european union successful attempt integration experiences constant pressures block laws standards creation common currency 
possibility real groups countries effectively want remain outside emerging global society 
conceivable different federations countries formed set rules minimizing exchanges 
happened degree cold war countries politically separated communist block 
moment important divisions oppose developed countries developing nations countries christian tradition countries tradition 
deepening divisions principle lead creation separate competing 
reasons scenario appears 
reason similar reason individual drop outs rare 
country decide leave international community systems rules immediately lose great benefits resources products services information new technologies solidarity significantly slow reverse development compared countries 
illustrated fate states iraq north korea fall 
growing provide increasingly strong incentive regime change policies 
negative effects disconnecting rest world mitigated large number countries drop forming rival block 
cold war shown competing blocks roughly matched size resources military power remain level development 
economic technological progress accelerating exponential process small differences initial conditions speed development lead increasing gaps clear everybody block successful 
put increasing pressure successful block open successful order assimilate successes 
second reason splitting superorganism effect global communication preferences standards 
people choose competing similarly valuable alternatives tend choose encounter 
reinforces lead common positive feedback loop law increasing returns quickly drives alternatives lock see arthur 
situation heylighen communication groups limited may lead different standards different groups cf 
campbell heylighen campbell era fast global communication groups tend converge single standard short time 
third reason basic values underlying different political ethical systems effectively universal 
scenario assumes competing options equally valuable vhs vs standards video 
different cultures groups disagree fundamental values 
example nations consider capital punishment intrinsically believe certain crimes punished death 
differences led argue values intrinsically relative culture dependent rational mechanism reaching consensus 
forget irrational mechanism increasing returns discussed grounds consensus 
different may disagree certain concrete dos don ts eating respectively eating beef basic values shared 
ethical systems murder theft lying positive side people cultures basically agree value health wealth friendship knowledge honesty safety equality freedom fact universal values derived empirically examining socio economic factors correlate people happiness life satisfaction different groups heylighen supported theoretically examining conditions conducive evolutionary fitness individual social level 
resulting list remarkably similar universal declaration human rights showing universal standards rationally agreed practical implementation cases remains open discussion 
emerging global network intensify accelerate going discussion 
recurrent worry kind socio technological developments sketched may increase gap particularly access information creating people excluded benefits superorganism 
global brain technologies sketched adopted quickly best educated populations poorer regions joining little 
internet technologies relatively inexpensive install compared roads electricity running water expensive 
interface intelligent easier requiring lower education level entry 
speech technologies soon web available may teach read write process 
emerging global brain inexpensive efficient medium increase education level access information economic competitiveness regions world helping third world countries bridge gap countries 
stock suggests regions central africa suffer wars epidemics developed world superorganism nervous systems really implanted regions making vulnerable lack resources diseases perturbations tight control 
superorganism interest suppress perturbations core periphery going pressure extend systems remote regions 

global superorganism proposed sketch evolutionary cybernetic model society development seen emergence global superorganism 
reasoning underlying model summarized follows 
complex systems composed variety interacting subsystems chemical networks ecosystems societies tend evolve coherence interdependence subsystems mutually adapt 
system dependent environment increasingly closed 
sufficient degree organizational closure system seen autopoietic living sense 
living organismic systems combine organizational closure realized network internal feedback cycles thermodynamic openness entailing input low entropy resources output high entropy waste 
allows conceptually divide system functional components responsible different stages processing incoming matter energy metabolism processing information needed maintain cybernetic control mechanism nervous system 
system continues evolve going adaptation division labor lead increasingly diverse complex efficient organization consisting specialized components 
general model complex self organizing systems directly applied development society 
society organismic system consisting organisms individual people viewed superorganism 
conspicuous trends globalization automation rise computer networks understood aspects general evolution increasing efficiency superorganism robust 
particular increasing efficiency explains growing economic productivity decrease friction facilitates material informational exchanges 
accompanying differentiation integration explain seemingly opposite trends outsourcing mergers growing importance rules standards institutions 
increasing efficiency communication control explains increasing functional autonomy components individuals organizations concurrent flattening hierarchies rise 
effects trends positive individuals society heylighen side effects detrimental heylighen 
reduced friction particular increases risk positive feedback processes get control 
leads increasingly complex causal chains interconnected events augmenting need information gathering processing 
controlling dangers requires strengthening superorganism nervous system 
control system centralized distributed components 
centralization exemplified growing importance global institutions responsible formulation implementation international standards rules laws 
distributed control exemplified invisible hand mutually adjusts supply demand 
effectiveness boosted emerging global computer network 
increasing reach capacity intelligence network allow automate functions superorganism nervous system
