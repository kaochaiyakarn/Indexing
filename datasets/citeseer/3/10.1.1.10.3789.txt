node transmission queues contain data send new token generated sent ring 
able support different classes network traffic ieee option assigning priorities messages 
data frame token contains bits priority providing levels priority 
node may seize token data transmit priority level equal priority frame currently travelling network 
data transmitted capture token may equal higher priority priority token 
additionally data frame token field indicating highest pri node ring 
reservation bits inspected time frame passes node

way node requests token issued priority equal priority data waiting head queue 
token returns node highest priority may access network medium transmit data 
node issues token priority higher preceding token comes responsible making sure token lower priority ing token released network point time 
ieee token ring networks restrict fairness messages priority 
lower priority packets may experience starvation caused large amounts higher priority packets waiting transmit queues various nodes 
ieee token ring networks defined operating speeds mbit mbit higher speed feature early token release supported means node may release token soon transmitted bit 
wait frame completely traverse ring 
early token release increases available bandwidth improves data transmission efficiency frame shorter ring latency 
access delays higher priority traffic may increase high load short frames placed early token release enabled network 
proposed different method scheduling ieee token ring network guarantees deadlines synchronous traffic reduces response time asynchronous traffic 
apply scheduling approach algorithmic techniques schedulability decisions arbitrary message sets 
costly tuning network parameters longer needed

examined scheduling models early token release normal token release ieee 
max imum bandwidth utilization protocols packet size smaller time needed signal circulate ring early token release significantly improve bandwidth utilization 
early token release protocol larger blocking component hurt performance large number nodes relatively long deadlines nodes short deadlines 
large amount blocking incurred early token release mechanism probably cause deadline misses packets short deadline 
ng liu simulated token ring network high speed network split multiple low speed subnetworks increase effective network bandwidth decrease response time

timed token protocols guarantee token arrive node period 
choo kim proposed approach token arrives exactly requested period enabling reliable periodic communication

broadcast networks broadcast networks typically set shared bus network node talk directly node nodes 
best known example network ethernet widely world today 
current ethernet networks operate speed mbit mbit typically home office environments 
ethernet networks operate mbit data network centres 
people working creating deterministic ethernet networks enabling real time purposes 
ethernet uses csma cd beb resolve concurrent medium accesses proper real time guarantees network messages impossible 
nodes decide transmit message simultaneously slot time collision occurs network 
beb algorithm take slots time packet delivered returned non deliverable 
equals ms mbit ethernet network 
beb protocol operates follows 
node maintains collision counter set zero initially succesful transmission 
collision experienced increased maximum reached message marked non deliverable 
back time chosen uniformly distributed range 
min wait slots transmission packet attempted 
average message delay increases linearly amount traffic increases measurements boggs 
deterministically send messages worst case assumptions 
maximum waiting time unrealistically large occurs rarely feasible option

traffic smoothing approach uses statistical method bound medium access time limiting packet arrival rate mac layer 
non real time traffic bursts smoothed spread longer time period allow real time traffic network arrives 
virtual time window protocols discussed 
virtual time csma virtual time protocols implement packet release delay mechanism 
proposed molle kleinrock protocols follows 
node clocks gives real time gives virtual time 
channel idle virtual clock running stops running channel busy 
virtual clock runs runs higher rate real 
message sent arrival time equal time virtual clock 
zhao ramamritham describe virtual time csma carrier sense multiple access protocols virtual clocks differ 
original virtual time csma protocol uses arrival time determine transmit message 
zhao ramamritham proposed variant uses message laxity determine transmit 
proposed variants transmitting messages earliest deadline transmitting messages shortest length 
zhao ramamritham collision resolution algorithm simulations 
collision occurs sender node retransmits mes sage immediately probability pi modifies virtual time start trans mission message random number drawn range chosen specifically protocol variant message put back queue mes sages waiting transmitted 
simulations showed variants insensitive number nodes network protocols perform better straightforward collision resolution algorithm 
variants sensitive rate virtual clock load light 
cases extreme network overload large normalized transmission delay exists wide range virtual clock rates variant optimal close optimal performance 
light medium load variants perform similarly high load performance differs 
original virtual time csma protocol performs poorly message loss effective channel utilization ratio biased messages length causes collisions 
laxity variant performs best terms effective channel utilization performs poorly terms message loss 
shortest length variant performs terms message loss worst channel utilization worst collision strategy 
minimum deadline variant best performance comes message loss collisions biased short messages previous 
channel utilization laxity variant 
zhao ramamritham concluded variant outperforms laxity minimum deadline variants recommended hard real time communications 
improved minimum deadline variant support hard real time soft real time messages 
variant reserves time slots hard real time messages experiments carried simulation written showed hard real time messages transmitted load conditions 
soft real time messages sacrificed possible percentage soft real time messages dropped deteriorate compared minimum deadline variant 
el el proposed virtual time csma variant puts message priorities picture 
messages belong priority classes higher priority messages precedence sending 
node high priority messages sends reservation signal network 
signal cause collisions high priority messages transmits 
collide nodes high priority packets normal virtual time csma protocol transmit high priority messages 
vation signal low priority messages may transmitted 
protocol lower throughput original virtual time csma protocol behaves better high priority packets original 
molle improved original protocol allowing certain number pri classes 
uses virtual clock priority class 
messages highest priority class scheduled sent run virtual clock catches real time 
lower priority class messages sched normalized transmission delay defined maximum delay divided mean message length

nodes network wide knowledge packets waiting transmitted 
protocol operates roughly follows 
node message window message sent 
nodes message window window size reduced node message window remains 
nodes message window window shifted time axis 
management window responsibility access arbitration process 
traditional window protocol proposed gallager modified allow implementation minimum laxity mlf policies order suitable real time applications 
zhao window latest time send message meet deadline 
window protocol immediately considers newly arriving message transmission latest time send pending messages system 
protocol closely approximates optimal mlf policy
