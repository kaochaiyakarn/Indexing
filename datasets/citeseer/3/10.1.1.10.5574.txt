turn agent selects action agenda utility bring 
eating convenient choice agent 
begins turn may turns interrupted aggression 
eater strength changes eating completed eater strength changes discrete way 
food item consumed immediately restored randomly chosen location grid 
second best choice agent move unoccupied grid position food seen 
agents see food territory consists cells agent move step current location 
choice move position food agent see food item smell extended neighborhood consists steps direction agent current location 
aggression option available agent 
food available seeing agent may attack eating neighbor 
outcome attack determined agents respective strengths stronger agent wins 
competitors equally strong defender winner 
cost aggression equal cost attacked 
agents may attacked agent time case victim cost multiplied number

choices available agent move randomly food seen attack possible pause random move possible 
match time steps includes agents food items value units

main objective scenario comparison number attacks strength agents follow social norms act utilitarian rules 
types agents proposed blind aggression constrained personal utility strength 
blind agents attack time cost alternative action explained higher

strategic aggression constrained strategic reasoning 
strategic agents attack strength higher 
eater strength perceptible step away agent current location 
normative ones follow norm precedence regarding agents nd food owners
