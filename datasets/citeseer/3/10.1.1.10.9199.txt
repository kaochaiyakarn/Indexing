user assessment visual web genre classifier maya nicholas kushmerick joan jose institute control system research smart media institute computer vision center bulgarian academy sciences university college dublin autonomous university barcelona bulgaria ireland spain bas bg nick ucd cvc es users assess appropriateness web documents ways 
traditionally appropriateness solely matter relevance particular topic 
users concerned aspects document genre level expertise assumed author amount detail 
previous machine learning automatically classify documents variety genre dimensions developed graphical interface depicts documents visually orthogonal genre dimensions

factors influence appropriateness web documents complement topic relevance dimension degree expertise level details positive negative review

traditional search retrieval focuses mainly topic relevance 
novel graphical search interfaces emphasize relevance 
research goal twofold try automatically assess document position topic relevance dimensions visualize information perceptually meaningful way help users find needed document
