conversely mechanism paying perform task sense try keep total payment low 
consider setting mechanism accomplish task hire team agents 
agent performs fixed service incurs fixed cost performing service 
exist certain teams agents combine perform task team subset 
special case agents edges network wish send network nodes teams paths

vcg mechanism asks edges report costs chooses shortest path reported costs 
viewing type auction refer reported costs bids denote edge case payments negative agents buying mechanism

assume exist edge disjoint paths mechanism payments edge profit exactly value adds system amount presence decreases length shortest path 
mechanism pays zero edges chosen path 
edge chosen path pays cost cost 
cost denotes cost shortest path bid zero cost cost shortest path graph deleted 
viewed differently payment highest value bid part shortest path 
bids truthfully profit cost cost ce added value

vickrey auction nice property hope carry shortest path problem 
buying service lowest bidder know losing paying second lowest bid 
course lowest bid second lowest paying big premium enforce truthfulness 
truthful auction mechanisms hope find pays constant times lowest bid 
unfortunately elementary arguments show impossible 
vickrey pays second lowest bid tight competition market premium truthfulness probably high lowest bids close 
contrast vcg shortest path mechanism pay times cost chosen path disjoint alternate path similar cost 
consider graph consisting disjoint paths suppose length path bids length edges 
vcg mechanism chooses path edge payment highest bid shorter path 
total payment

problem removal edge forces take path presence edges marginal added value edge requires edges reap benefit 
entire path entity vcg mechanism pay profit composed entities induced bid truthfully mechanism pay total profit results 
show reasonable truthful mechanism avoids pitfall 
note roughly payment scheme entirely determined path selection rule payment edge chosen path equal threshold bid longer chosen path 
restrict selecting shortest path vcg truthful mechanism 
conceivable choosing shortest path yield better payment 
edge chosen path paid bid want choose fairly short path respect bids 
vcg mechanism paid lot pay profits different edges suggests give preference paths fewer edges 
natural class selection rules allows easily encode preferences call min function mechanisms
