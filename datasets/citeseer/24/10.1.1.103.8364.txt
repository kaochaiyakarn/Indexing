summary discussion studying vocabulary problems unfamiliar computer applications 
summarize findings major points 
single access term name chosen single designer provide poor access hit rates 
second single empirically optimized term better armchair aliases 
third achieve really performance aliases needed 
empirically frequency weighted unlimited aliases system produce hit rates guesses queries depending domain amount data collected 
limit barrier precision data show frequency data possible objects intended term usually provide ambiguity resolution 
brings reasonable access provided extensive table word usage behavior compiled 
solution technically simple potentially tedious 
note extent collection multiple aliases arise done iterative interface design 
provide example 
report alias collection accounted largest share dramatic interface performance improvements resulting careful iterative design process extensive user testing 
iterative design interfaces useful reasons analyses suggest vocabulary problem attacked separately 
done tedium cost 
fortunately appear attractive alternatives 
quick dirty approach get fair number say representative users supply fair number say terms apiece object 
experiment gomez lochbaum small interactive search system obtained predicted fold increase user ability find desired recipe approach 
technique cost effective databases moderate size expected remain stable long periods infrequently people 
familiar approach textual objects extract multiple access terms automatically content 
recipe texts contain roughly keywords selected users experiment reported gomez lochbaum landauer full text indexing roughly equivalent extensive alias harvesting experts recipe database 
third exciting possibility construct unlimited alias indices adaptively site 
adaptive indexing methods discussed idea simple partial precursors literature basically adaptive indexing system begins index obtained ordinary way example armchair naming 
users try words access desired objects tries usually fail 
eventually find want 
user concurrence initially unsuccessful words added system usage table 
time seeks object index knowledgeable 
adaptive indexes collect needed data relatively right users authentic conditions 
start pay rapidly automatically tend focus data collection sought objects 
trials systems show produce kind large performance improvements predicted systems massive alias lists 
augment earlier say drastic improvement needed possible practicable
