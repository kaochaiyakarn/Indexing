generating spatio temporal descriptions pollen forecasts ross turner sripada ehud reiter dept computing science university aberdeen uk csd ac uk describe initial investigations generating textual summaries spatiotemporal data help prototype natural language generation nlg system produces pollen forecasts scotland 
new monitoring devices remote sensing systems generating vast amounts spatio temporal data 
devices coupled wider accessibility data spurred large amounts research best analysed

corpus analysis able learn text structure pollen forecasts 
forecasts normally start trend message include number forecast messages 
messages normally occur forecast 
due fact input pollen text gen weather hours grass pollen count example forecast explanation message values low sensitive pollen may affected example message erator pollen data numerical form part second stage corpus analysis need map input data messages 
earlier numbers text nlg systems sumtime sripada trend boyd known data analysis techniques segmentation wavelet analysis employed task 
pollen data spatio temporal need employ spatio temporal data analysis techniques achieve mapping 
describe method section 
corpus analysis revealed forecast texts contain rich variety spatial descriptions location 
example region referred proper name relation known geographical landmark north great glen simply geographical location map far north northwest 
context pollen forecasts describe spatio temporal data studying semantics phrases words describing locations regions challenge 
currently analysing forecast texts underlying data understand spatial descriptions map underlying data methods applied sumtime project sripada

spatio temporal data analysis followed pipeline architecture text generation outlined reiter dale 
surface realisation modules sumtime project sripada largely reused 
developed new data analysis document planning modules system describe data analysis module rest section 
data analysis module performs segmentation trend detection data providing results input natural language generation sys message type data dependency corpus coverage forecast pollen data day forecast trend past pollen forecasts forecast explanation weather forecast day forecast pollen levels affect hay fever general general domain knowledge tem

data analysis steps 
segmentation geographic regions non spatial attributes pollen values 
segmentation segmented geographic regions spatial attributes geographic proximity 
detection trends generalised pollen level region time segmentation task segmentation consists major subtasks clustering classification miller han 
spatial clustering involves grouping objects similar subclasses spatial classification involves finding description subclasses differentiates clustered objects ester 
pollen values measured scale low high 
defined initial categories segmentation 

high 
moderate 
low categories proved rigid purposes 
due fact human forecasters take flexible approach classifying pollen values 
example corpus pollen value referred moderate level pollen low moderate level pollen 
lead define categories derived initial categories 


initial segmentation data carried system stage process 
firstly regions clustered initial categories pollen value 
table message categorisation pollen corpus second stage involves merging adjacent categories contain regions adjacent values 
example take input data table stage sets value value value value value value stage create union moderate high sets give value value value value value value initial segmentation accomplished step completing steps provided simple software engineering solution 
carry segmentation sets spatial attributes 
set regions pollen levels see fact spatial neighbours 
north north east north west regions described spatially northern part country 
say pollen levels moderate high northern central parts country similarly members set containing regions pollen levels spatial neighbours say pollen levels high level south country 
process yields sets value value sets created passed document planner encapsulated individual forecast messages 
trend detection trend detection system works generalising sets created segmentation 
sets say generally pollen levels high scotland 
looking previous days forecast detect trend comparing generalisations 
previous days forecast high say pollen levels remain high levels yesterday 
looking back previous days high say pollen levels remain high levels days 
previous days forecast low say pollen levels increased low levels 
data analysis module conveys information relation general pollen level today general pollen level timescale document planner encapsulates information trend message 
results data analysis input nlg pipeline output produced 
grass pollen levels monday remain moderate high levels days values parts country

spatio temporal weather prediction data road maintenance applications normally order megabyte initially studied pollen forecasts smaller spatio temporal data sets 
apply various techniques learnt study pollen forecasts spatio temporal data road maintenance application 
summary automatically generating spatio temporal descriptions involves main subtasks 
subtask focuses spatio temporal analysis input data extract information required different message types identified corpus analysis
