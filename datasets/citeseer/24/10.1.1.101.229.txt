versioning xml documents section choice storage strategy 
describe various alternatives motivate strategy chose 
discuss management xids identifiers nodes 
discuss details implementation aspects storage 
physical organization mentioned store version current repository xml document containing sequence forward completed deltas 
see 
store xid map current version provides means obtain xids current nodes 
suffices reconstruct sequence snapshots 
completed deltas information lost 
native xml repository stores xml data tree 
represent changes xml trees facilitates querying sending clients 
changes described xml may quite verbose storage wise see 
lot redundancy introduced tags insert delete repository represents tags integers repeated store 
crux technique check new version mainly consists adding new data store 
typically faster repository repositories updating data place 
important aspect choice storage policy 
compare alternative representations 
physical representations described 
storing st versions forward deltas 
computation slightly better storage completed deltas simple deltas space 
typically fewer disk pages loaded compute main issue storing versions document 
drawback getting version may costly start storing version backwards deltas 
computation efficient 
solution saves space compared previous complete version stored 
space consuming method chose simple deltas typically smaller completed ones 
main drawback computation simple deltas inverted see information missing delta may requires loading processing obtain storing history 
imagine storing history style 
spirit typical storage versioned object databases 
representation object contains entire history xml node 
clearly better approach temporal queries 
new version modify store objects modified 
update place typically costly terms processing 
mentioned decided store version sequence forward completed deltas 
believe compromise 
version available 
forward deltas pruning completed deltas backward deltas inversion pruning available 
perform updates store appends 
storage viewpoint certainly best completed deltas space consuming simple backward deltas 
see com pression allows reduce redundant storage reasonable level 
management xids section consider critical issue method management xyleme ids xids 
xids persistent identifiers nodes document 
xyleme uses node identification full text indexing 
requirements full text indexing differ versioning 
xids change management particular versioning module 
xid map provides mapping nodes tree integers identify nodes 
xid map specifies available integer avoid reassigning id node deleted new node 
example xid map tree applies shown 
xid map listing xids nodes postorder traversal tree 
listing ranges produces important space savings 
example available xid xid map specifies traverse tree postorder assign integers doing particular mapping obtained instance tree xid map nodes deleted node moved 
xid map assigns unique persistent integer node 
argue compact storage wise manner 
tree xid map method creating managing xid maps described initialization 
initialization xid map number nodes tree 
states tree visited postorder assigning integers available integer 
evolution 
note xids persistent names 
particular original node keep initial identification moved 
insertions assign new integers nodes inserted subtrees postorder traversal inserted subtrees 
matching old version assignment xids new nodes provide xids nodes new version 
xid map new version constructed traversing resulting tree postorder recording identifiers nodes traversed 
see example consider xid map suppose subtree deleted 
stage xids subtree consist consecutive integers say xid map suppose insert new subtree nodes just node post order traversal 
resulting xid map note xid map tree provides identifiers node tree 
observe identification stored separately tree data 
consider storing xids inside xml document add extra attribute element store xid 
main drawback method space 
add attribute node document may increase size document negligible way roughly depending nature storage specific document 
involves changing internally document leads extra accessing document processing queries 
xid map allows identify nodes particular version unique manner 
provides identification nodes 
stored current version stored separately document 
portions xid map deleted subtrees stored delta 
user requests current version interested changes snapshots user sent current version xid map 
changes refer xids assignment specified xid map 
observe document nodes length list xid map may grow worst case integers precisely order log bits 
observe general list smaller integers 
size list may grow linearly number changes large number nodes document 
practice operations may reduce length xid map insertions large subtrees tend reduce ratio size number nodes document 
may expect general xid map smaller log xids attributes play special role 
observe xml allow node attributes name say attribute node complete identification 
assign xids attributes element text nodes 
attributes ordered xml obvious extend notion xids essentially order attributes definition unordered xml 
conclude section mention techniques identifying nodes considering 
dtds 
elements handled attributes 
suppose instance dtd states product single sub element called description 
identity description node xid product tag 
semantic ids 
assign xyleme ids nodes independently document content 
cases data may contain meaningful identifiers 
observe user viewpoint identifiers carry meaning system generated ids 
particular xml world ids idrefs typically denote elements primary candidate serving semantic ids 
possible data xids 
note persistence identifiers guaranteed xml 
position 
ways specify compactly positions tree 
instance xyleme uses indexing purposes prefix postfix level coding allows identify node triplet ranking pre order traversal document postorder level 
drawback techniques identifications persistent 
structure tree changes identifier node 
currently working identification mechanism combine persistence xid scheme positional information needed query processing able determine node ancestor 
selective xids 
lastly may consider identifying xids certain kinds elements typically change 
catalog new products going added prices changed identification products extent characteristics change

completed delta stored xml document 
system decides install new version data steps occur 
new version obtained web previous version loaded disk 

diff run versions provides matching nodes versions 

xids attached nodes old version xid map old version

inserted nodes get new xids 
xid map new version constructed 

completed delta computed 

new version new xid map stored 
completed delta appended delta 
old version deleted 
main issue completed deltas storage redundant information 
example element detected updated versions new value update old value update 
repeated values may large strings 
similarly subtree inserted deleted appears twice completed deltas 
storage strategy possibly introduces redundancy 
possible reduce cost keeping track data recorded redundantly store 
query processing harder 
pointers values store installation new version quite costly 
decided redundant storage policy possibility apply periodically compression steps 
compression compression read history detect large objects stored redundantly 
data smaller size pointers simply efficient simply duplicate data 
note detection rely xids provide persistent identification objects 
pointers physical locations store 
process sequence deltas starting replacing repeated large objects pointers locations delta 
standard issues detailed 
compression step show storage comparable obtained standard versioned database 
conclude section briefly mention complementary techniques 
current implementation implement aggregation 
intermediate versions archiving supported 
aggregation typically granularity document varies time 
want versions month weekly previous monthly previous year yearly 
may necessary aggregate consecutive deltas 
typically result space saving cost loss information 
intermediate versions may useful store intermediate versions time time 
intermediate versions complicates change queries monitoring speed instance recomputation old states 
archiving approach archiving straightforward

surprisingly size grows linearly reasonably ratio changes 
small documents reaches faster size document
