areas itis equally acute 
issue certainly broader computer science legal ethical aspects 
question computer scientists especially theoretical computer scientists may want ask technical issues involved susan davidson chris fidel bioinformatics center penn providing information

areas computer science hard part formulate problem concise applicable fashion 
done happens interesting technical problems emerge 
reviews technical issues emerged initial exploration 
computing provenance query inversion area data provenance receive substantial attention provenance data obtained query operations input databases 
restricted setting formalization notion data provenance turns challenging problem 
speci cally tuple output database query applied source data wewant understand tuples contributed output tuple compact mechanism identifying input tuples 
natural approach isto generate new query determined query applied generates collection input tuples contributed output tuple words identify provenance inverting original query 
course ask mean contributed 
problem studied various names including data pedigree data lineage :10.1.1.6.1848:10.1.1.54.5459
way answer question say tuple input database contributes output tuple changing input tuple causes output tuple change disappear output 
de nition breaks simplest queries projection union 
better approach simple proof theoretic de nition 
dealing queries expressible positive relational algebra generally positive datalog say input tuple fact contributes output tuple minimal derivation tuple 
simple de nition works expected properties invariant query rewriting compositional expected way 
unfortunately desirable properties break presence negation form aggregation 
see consider simple sql query select name telephone employee salary select average salary employee modifying tuple employee relation ect presence output tuple 
query de nition contributes employee relation contribute tuple output 
perfectly reasonable de nition properties invariance query rewriting compositionality break indicating sophisticated de nition may needed 
going worth remarking characterization provenance related topics truth maintenance view maintenance 
problem view maintenance follows 
suppose database view generated expensive query database 
source database changes recompute view recomputing query 
truth maintenance problem terminology deductive systems 
may query inversion simpler interested database interested updates add tuples database 
notion provenance introduced 
consider sql query suppose see tuple john doe output 
previous discussion tells tuple output 
ask apparently simpler question tuple appears output telephone number come 
answer easy john doe tuple input 
imply long means identifying tuples employee relation compute provenance tracing variable emits query 
intuition fragile general characterization obvious discussed 
provenance related view update problem john doe decides change telephone number view data modi ed employee relation 
provenance simpler interested view 
issue query inversion capture query languages data models 
example describe problem objectoriented semistructured data models xml 
models interesting longer operating xed level tuples relational model 
ask provenance deeply nested component structure 
studies issue data provenance deterministic model semistructured data element canonical path identi er 
view model studied 
leads topics citing archiving data 
data citation digital library typically large heterogeneous collection line documents databases sophisticated software exploring collection 
digital libraries organized serve scholarly resources 
case dowe cite component digital library 
surprisingly topic received little attention 
appear generally useful standards citations 
organized databases constructed keys allow uniquely identify tuple relation 
giving attribute name identify component tuple usually canonical path component database 
cite portions documents especially xml documents clear 
url provides universal locator document proceed inside document 
page numbers line numbers exist xml document represent database linear document structure irrelevant 
initial notions keys xml standard xml schema proposals 
xml document type descriptor dtd declare id attribute 
values attribute unique document locate elements document 
id attribute structure document simply user de ned identi er 
xml schema de nition key relies xpath path description language xml 
roughly speaking key consists paths data 
rst path example department employee describes set nodes key constraint imposed 
called target set 
second path example number uniquely identi es nodes target set 
second part called key path rule distinct nodes target set di erent values key paths 
apart details fact xpath probably complex language key speci cation de nition quite take account hierarchical structure keys common organized databases documents 
give example needed consider problem citing part bible organized chapter book verse 
start idea books bible keyed name pair paths bible book name assuming bible unique root 
may want indicate chapters speci ed number incorrect write bible book chapter number says chapter numbers unique bible 
need specify relative key consists triple bible book chapter number 
means chapter number key hold node speci ed path bible book 
detailed description relative keys 
basic inference results known open questions surrounding appropriate path languages various components key 
inference results established languages 
specify foreign keys results hold 
interactions keys dtds 
practical questions need answered databases keys basis indexing query optimization 
archiving problems associated provenance suppose formulation standard data citation document cites component document responsibility maintain integrity 
owner may wish update invalidating citation serious problem scienti databases commonly done release successive versions database separate documents 
version extension previous version wasteful space space overhead limits rate release versions 
di cult history database kept form trace history components database de ned key structure 
number open questions compress versions history ciently recorded 
keeping cited data responsibility 
gure cited keep portions 
context worth noting cite url hardly give date citation 
person follows citation know question validity citation comparing timestamp url 
suppose agreed standard citations computing provenance query inversion possible data interest created query decide annotate element database citations describes provenance 
space overhead doing 
citations structure structure data part related structure data assumes form compression possible 
tempted speculate may need completely di erent model data exchange databases characterize capture provenance 
imagine data exchanged packages self aware contain complete history moved system databases constructed changed 
idea obviously appealing formulated clearly implemented open question
