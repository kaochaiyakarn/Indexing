insightful knowledge gathered allowing build fraud abuse taxonomy identifies different types 
revision procedure motivated improvements manual revision process 
able estimate new fraud detection system rejected medical claims contributed raw costs 
additionally persistent fraud abuse cases detected months earlier system estimated historical records 
savings considerably higher due premature detection cases changed fraud detection policy reactive detection strategy yielded documented cases proactive preventive detection strategy reaching approximately fraudulent abusive cases month 
drastic increase mainly due contribution fraud detection system 
current fraud detection rate yields savings cover operational costs allowed increase quality health care coverage fully justifying investment 
fraud detection systems single monolithic model divide conquer approach able analyze involved entity separately beneficial side effects dimensional reduction consequent model robustness
