problem statement virtual community group persons interacting communicating internet services data exchange provided web site usually called community web site 
due rapid growth number internet users virtual communities popular world especially entertainment purposes joined free 
cases web site usually managed internet service provider rewarded terms advertising availability huge amount data useful information retrieved 
deals analysis data mining data related popular italian virtual community virtual community people people tiscali tiscali nd biggest european internet service provider 
virtual community large witnessed high number daily accesses web site page views community web site complex structure providing large variety web services forums chats message post programs downloads line games access web site virtual community people require advance registration users strongly encouraged simply filling profile form multiple choices predefined list items choosing nickname unique single user 
profile sort virtual id user 
registration users opportunity log web site performing navigation session personal data available users 
number registered users time 
analysis large data sets data base db users data set collecting user nicknames profiles 
week log file servers hosting community web site text file accesses web site registered 
needless say data sets extremely different deliver complementary pieces information processed analyzed completely different techniques 
main goal main original contribution methodological point view establish relationships heterogeneous data sets 
inherently challenging task best knowledge attempts documented data mining literature merge find relationships user profiles web navigation behaviors large virtual community 
search relationships half users millions page views faced directly starting raw data 
basic idea methodological approach proposed follows user db analyzed clustered small number clusters cluster represents prototype user section log file web server analyzed clustered unsupervised bisecting divisive clustering approach clusters cluster represents navigation behavior section huge dimensional reduction data sets user db reduced items week log file reduced items possible find association map user clusters navigation session cluster section 
note done page views registered log file contain nickname user stored cookie 
allows linking user db log file 
trivial data mining analysis preliminary provides general full rounded picture virtual community users

analysis clustering week web log file second data set analyzed log file servers hosting virtual community web site collected week monday sunday january 
log file analyzed standard log file delivered apache web server quite huge gbytes 
fig small sample file shown 
item row log file represents single page view navigation session performed single user contains data see fig ip address remote host user retrieving web page 
complete time stamp

cookie containing nickname user 
note cookie stored log file registered user logged small subset functions web site restricted logged registered users 
main objective second part establish means clustering procedure kind navigation sessions users community perform visiting community web site 
retrieving information log file required non trivial pre processing due structure log file 
fact log file raw text file stores ip address time stamp visited url nickname user additional data relevant purposes 
may happen due time delays routing problems web web server receives multiple requests page single user consequence row replicated times log file 
log file just collects single access web site reconstruction navigation sessions basic data page views usually required 
treatment log file discussed subsection clustering subsection

starting raw data base extracted week log file page views step 
log file known tricky subtle task requires heuristic priori assumptions see 
rules reconstruct sessions log file db session constituted set time contiguous urls requested host ip address 
timeout minutes recognize different sessions urls requested ip address separated minutes assumed belong different sessions 
sessions extracted log file exhaustive search data base search possible sorting data consecutively place db time contiguous pageviews performed single user

note visiting time length page view computed considering difference complete time stamps subsequent page views session 
exception visited page nominal visiting time seconds assigned 
main priori assumption sessions reconstruction introduced subsection reconstruction matrix partially depends 
main problem assumption related fact arbitrarily chosen visiting time page view small cases leading evaluation error importance corresponding url 
noted error avoided time row element equal 
clearly means high probability corresponding url corresponding session true sessions visiting time columns visiting time equal 
situation occurs user accesses web site remains session single page example visiting pages devoted chatting messaging 
worth mentioning see subsection single page sessions described frequent session matrix confirms assuming visiting time seconds page view misleading 
clustering third step log file analysis clustering session matrix obtained subsection 
indications kind sessions users performed resorted unsupervised clustering data matrix partitioned number sub matrices priori external information similarity distance data 
basic rule partition maximize similarity elements sub matrix intra similarity minimize similarity elements different sub matrices inter similarity 
note contrast matrix user profiles section data stored quantitative ordinal nickname column si measures time spent user web page 
consequence consider nickname column fact seen label data allowing linking user db row session vector euclidean space dimensionality equal 
euclidean metric measure distance different sessions 
resort bisecting divisive partitioning algorithm 
brief see detailed discussion algorithms split entire data set clusters maximizing intra similarity minimizing inter similarity obtained clusters bisecting procedure iteratively applied time dividing single cluster obtained previous step 
iterations total amount obtained clusters satisfies certain stopping criterion 
analysis developed bisection clusters done cascade principal direction divisive partitioning pddp algorithm bisecting means algorithm 
sake self consistency algorithms briefly recalled tables 
cases input matrix data rows matrix outputs matrices algorithms quantity xi rows average data samples called centroid means introduced probably best known widely clustering technique best representative class iterative centroid divisive algorithms 
pddp proposed technique 
representative non iterative techniques singular value decomposition svd matrix built data set 
main difference means pddp means iterative procedure general provides different results different initializations pddp shot algorithm provides unique solution 
proven best performance terms quality partition computational effort obtained applying pddp followed kmeans initialized centroids clusters obtained result pddp 
bisection criterion select cluster split decide halting iterations pddp means bisecting algorithm chosen solution suggested 
solution computation certain performance index matrix data initial data set clusters obtaining performing pddp means measuring quantitatively convenient split considered matrix pddp means index fact measures separation degree clusters obtained bisection see details 
intensive computation index cluster step cluster split chosen optimizing performing index performance improvement better level divisions necessary obtaining final partition data set
