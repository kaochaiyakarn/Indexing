challenges artequakt project faces challenges ontology population maintenance knowledge extraction generation personalized artist biographies 
user driven ontology population tools avoid duplicating information documents creating redundant annotations 
automatic ontology population approaches face similar issues speed knowledge acquisition precision recall decrease 
automatically populating ontology diverse distributed web resources presents difficulties particularly consolidating duplicate information arises extracting similar overlapping information different sources

templates contain queries resolved final text 
maintain referential integrity results quality ontology knowledge service 
headway artequakt 
artequakt extraction tool automatically retrieves metadata triplets object ontology overcome limitations predefined fixed templates 
flexibility increases number ontology class relationship names decrease avoiding example compound obscure names confuse concept identification term expansion 
approach covers semantic variations coverage decrease limited term expansion 
extraction tool distinguish ontology relations synonymous names connect classes 
avoid specifying appropriate synonyms classes relations ontology design remove possible ambiguities

final rendered biography rembrandt 
specificity presents challenges automatic extraction 
example easily identify entity person harder tell person painter 
infer knowledge extract facts person information paintings produced 
likewise generating narrative prove difficult extracted sentences contain coreferences resolved narrative context 
example sentence pronoun sense artist previous subject 
similarly replacing artist name occurrences appropriate pronouns text readable 
narrative rendering duplication occur selected sentences contain information template requests 
query sentence containing birthdate include information artist parents system tracks additional information avoid duplication 
hand paragraphs artist family life determining include biography depend factors biography desired length interest level topic 
refining narrative generation techniques improve biographies quality relevance users 
theoretically able apply artequakt domains little technical change 
example replace current artist ontology actor ontology extracts specified information actors 
improve entity recognition performance domain specific entities painting styles films need specialized extraction rules modify domain changes 
plan investigate develop artequakt generic architecture
