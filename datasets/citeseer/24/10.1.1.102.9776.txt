describes experiment investigate non speech sounds dynamic information visual display space 
results showed non speech sound simple share dealing scenario sound graph share prices 
allowed participants reduce workload invest share price monitor ing listen graph whilst worked share accumulation window 
limitation current personal digital assistants pdas mo bile computing devices mainly static information address books diaries lists 
similar way 
de vices fact dynamic data thing 
example pda wireless network possible stock market traders mobile device keep track stock trends away trading floor 
stock prices sent device users moved monitor market 
wireless networks common possible deliver real time data mobiles 
problem display small screens typical devices cm pixels com palm best selling mobile computers 
visualisation techniques common desktop displays unusable require high resolution large displays colours 
example common method presenting stock trend data line graph 
mobile computer small display limited resolution mean users see history trend shown graph quickly gets scrolled left hand side screen reducing effective ness 
hard users see graph move trying look going visual attention directed moving environment mobile device 
way problem sound data graph ics 
non speech sound lot promise way displaying data take screen space 
ears higher temporal tivity eyes making sound way time varying data 
particular alternative method presenting line graphs sound blind people 
pitch sound stream mapped axis graph time axis listeners hear change pitch time 
shown users successfully able discern shapes range different mathematical functions 
area sonification equivalent visualisation non speech sound really applied mobiles 
exception mynatt looked serendipitous information activity office envi ronment auditory icons 
users got audio information activity environment 
mynatt carry evaluation assess effectiveness system 
glasgow sound improve usability widgets inter faces mobile devices complex menu structures improve navigation mobile telephones menus 
studies shown sound effective improving usability whilst reducing amount visual attention needed device sound provide access time varying dynamic data handheld 
experiment simple experiment conducted see formation stock trading effective mobile 
simple share trading scenario created data month trades swiss bank

experimental task parts task split panes tabbed view simulator 
part see viewer window required users search large row table trade information late shares sell 
users row field heading search scrollbar get value cell type 
correctly got share trade 
task required lot visual attention served distract users line graph 
monitor window contained line graph displayed current price shares 
view enabled users sell shares profit 
scrolling line graph updated second simulation values read data file 
horizontal blue line represented price shares bought 
shares sold line resulted profit 
system participants perform search tasks viewer window ac cumulate sell shares monitor window know current values shares identify time sell 
experimental design experiment counterbalanced condition groups design 
visual condition standard line graph monitor window audio condition visual line graph added heard playing continuously 
training condition 
workload measured condition

dependent variables number times monitor window consulted time spent window profit subjective workload measured modified nasa scales 
sounds earcons data 
sounds representing data monitor window similar saw pad played internal midi synthesiser package 
share values mapped directly midi notes num bers similar way 
participants heard continuous sound varying pitch higher pitch meant higher price vice versa 
hypotheses audio presentation monitor window allow pants keep better track price shares standard visual line graph visual attention shared tasks 
shown fewer consultations monitor window time spent moni tor window profit lower subjective workload 
results discussion number consultations monitor window significantly reduced audio condition falling average lookups visual condition audio amount time spent monitor window confirming hypotheses 
difference number shares bought sold profit conditions rejecting hypotheses 
significant reduction subjective workload auditory condi tion see 
average workload fell 
particular participants rated physical demand effort required frustration lower audio condition subjective performance significantly higher 
significant difference terms annoyance due sounds user preference strongly favour 
results confirm hy 
average workload mental physical time effort frustration annoyance performance preference workload categories visual auditory average nasa workload scores participants standard error bars shown 
results show successful reducing frequency amount time participants looked monitor window able monitoring sounds whilst staying viewer win dow 
monitoring effective profit conditions providing information needed 
fact participants looked monitor window spent rest experiment listening sounds know value shares 
strong reductions workload sounds helped users perform share trading tasks lower investment cognitive visual re sources 
participants maintained level performance profit visual condition cost higher workload 
reducing workload important situations users perform tasks walking moving real world 
tasks require cognitive resources fewer invested mobile device 
results suggest share dealing interface mobile device realistic mobile environment visual graph monitoring performance fall 
performance robust initial results evaluation undertaken whilst users walking outside entering data real palm iii shown significant perform ance workload benefits gained addition sound 
non speech shown effective way presenting dy namic time varying data mobile computers 
advantage monitored whilst user performing visual task take limited amount screen space 
reduce workload user invest perform task 
important sounds allow users eyes look going navigate en vironment whilst able mobile devices time
