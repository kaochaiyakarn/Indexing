important application class peer data management natural extension data integration aberer 
peer data management system away notion mediated schema allows peers participating data sources query retrieve data directly 
querying data retrieval require creation semantic correspondences peers 
considerable attention model management creates tools easily manipulating models data data representations website structures er diagrams 
semantic integration plays central role matching merging models form core operations model management algebras bernstein rahm bernstein 
data sharing applications described arise numerous current real world domains 
play important role emerging domains commerce bioinformatics ubiquitous computing 
developments dramatically increase need deployment applications require semantic integration 
internet brought millions data sources possible data sharing 
widespread adoption xml standard syntax share data streamlined eased data sharing process 
growth semantic web fuel data sharing applications underscore key role semantic integration plays deployment 
challenges semantic integration despite pervasiveness importance semantic integration remains extremely difficult problem 
consider example challenges arise schema matching process finds semantic correspondences called matches database schemas 
example relational databases house listing process finds matches location schema matches area schema name matches agent name 
core matching database schemas requires deciding elements match refer real world concept 
problem challenging fundamental reasons semantics involved elements inferred information sources typically creators data documentation associated schema data 
extracting semantics information data creators documentation extremely cumbersome 
frequently data creators long moved retired forgotten data 
documentation tends sketchy incorrect outdated 
settings building data integration systems remote web sources data creators documentation simply accessible 
schema elements typically matched clues schema data 
examples clues include element names types data values schema structures integrity constraints 
clues unreliable 
example elements share name area refer different real world entities location square feet area house 
reverse problem holds elements different names area location refer real world entity location house 
schema data clues incomplete 
example name contact agent suggests element related agent 
provide sufficient information determine exact nature relationship element agent phone number name 
decide element schema matches element schema typically examine elements sure element matches better global nature matching adds substantial cost matching process 
matters worse matching subjective depending application 
application may decide house style matches house description application may decide 
user involved matching process 
input single user may considered subjective committee assembled decide correct mapping clifton rosenthal 
challenges manual creation semantic matches long known extremely laborious error prone 
example project gte telecommunications sought integrate databases total elements attributes relational tables li clifton 
project planners estimated original developers databases just finding documenting matches elements take person years 
problem matching data tuples faces similar challenges 
general high cost manually matching schemas data spurred numerous solutions seek automate matching process 
users loop solutions semi automatic 
research solutions dates back early picked significant steam past decade due need manage astronomical volume distributed heterogeneous data enterprises web 
sections briefly review research schema data matching 
schema matching discuss progress schema matching respect matching techniques architectures matching solutions types semantic matches 
matching techniques wealth techniques developed semiautomatically find semantic matches 
techniques fall roughly groups rule solutions techniques leverage ideas fields information retrieval information theory developed clifton rosenthal kang naughton 
rule solutions early current matching solutions employ hand crafted rules match schemas milo zohar castano mitra wiederhold jannink madhavan bernstein rahm melnik molina garcia rahm 
general hand crafted rules exploit schema information element names data types structures number subelements integrity constraints 
broad variety rules considered 
example system milo zohar employs rules elements match name allowing synonyms number subelements 
dike system computes similarity schema elements similarity characteristics elements similarity related elements 
related castano bergamaschi system compute similarity schema elements weighted sum similarities name data type substructure 
cupid system madhavan bernstein rahm employs rules categorize elements names data types domains 
rules tend domainindependent tailored fit certain domain 
domain specific rules crafted 
rule techniques provide benefits 
relatively inexpensive require training learning techniques 
second typically operate schemas data instances fairly fast 
third certain types applications domain representations amenable rules noy musen 
rules provide quick concise method capture valuable user knowledge domain 
example user write regular expressions encode times phone numbers quickly compile collection county names zip codes help recognize types entities 
example domain academic course listing user write rule regular expressions recognize elements times match time element start time second element time 
learning techniques discuss shortly difficulties applied scenarios 
learn rules abundant training data right representations training examples 
main drawback rule techniques exploit data instances effectively instances encode wealth information value format distribution frequently occurring words attribute values greatly aid matching process 
cases effective matching rules simply difficult hand craft 
example clear hand craft rules distinguish movie description user comments movies long textual paragraphs 
contrast learning methods naive bayes easily construct probabilistic rules distinguish high accuracy frequency words paragraphs 
drawback rule methods exploit previous matching efforts assist current ones 
sense systems rely solely rule techniques difficulties learning past improve time 
reasons motivated development learning matching solutions

architecture matching solutions complementary nature rule learner techniques suggest effective matching solution employ types information effectively exploit 
works bernstein rahm doan domingos halevy embley xu rahm described system architecture employs multiple modules called matchers exploits certain type information predict matches 
system combines predictions matchers arrive final prediction matches 
matcher employ set matching techniques described earlier hand crafted rules learning methods ir ones 
combining predictions matchers manually specified rahm bernstein automated extent learning techniques doan domingos halevy 
able exploit multiple types information multi matcher architecture advantage highly modular easily customized new application domain 
extensible new efficient matchers easily added available 
shows solution architecture extended successfully handle complex matches 
important current research direction evaluate multi matcher architecture realworld settings 
works bernstein rahm initial steps direction 
related direction appears shift away developing complex isolated monolithic matching systems creating robust widely useful matcher operators developing techniques quickly efficiently combine operators particular matching task 
incorporating domain constraints recognized early domain integrity constraints heuristics provide valuable information matching purposes 
matching solutions exploit forms type knowledge 
works exploit integrity constraints matching schema elements locally 
example works match elements participate similar constraints 
main problem scheme exploit global constraints heuristics relate matching multiple elements element matches house address 
address problem works melnik molina garcia rahm madhavan bernstein rahm doan domingos halevy doan advocated moving handling constraints matchers 
way constraint handling framework exploit global constraints highly extensible new types constraints 
integrity constraints constitute domain specific information house id key house listings heuristic knowledge general statements matching elements relate 
known example heuristic nodes match neighbors match variations exploited systems milo zohar madhavan bernstein rahm melnik molina garcia rahm noy musen

development techniques semiautomatically construct complex matches crucial practical mapping effort 
creating complex matches fundamentally harder matches reason 
number candidate matches pair schemas bounded product sizes schemas number candidate complex matches 
unbounded number functions combining attributes schema candidate match 
addition inherent difficulties generating match start problem exacerbated having examine unbounded number match candidates 
works complex matching 
milo zohar hard code complex matches rules 
rules systematically tried schema pair rule fires system returns complex match encoded rule 
works developed general techniques find complex matches 
rely domain ontology xu embley combination search learning techniques doan employ mining techniques chang han 
xu embley example considers finding complex matches schemas mapping domain ontology constructing matches relationships inherent ontology 
imap system reformulates schema matching search large infinite match space 
search effectively employs set searchers discovering specific types complex matches 
key observation gleaned far works really need domain knowledge lots 
perform accurate complex matching 
knowledge crucial guiding process searching complex match candidates vast infinite candidate space pruning incorrect candidates early maintain acceptable runtime evaluating candidates 
important observation correct complex match top ranked match top matches predicted 
finding complex match requires gluing different components elements involved operations inevitable inherent complex matching solution 
underscores importance generating explanations matches building effective match design environment humans effectively examine top ranked matches select correct ones 
data matching schema matching problem data matching deciding different relational tuples sources refer real world entity increasingly crucial
