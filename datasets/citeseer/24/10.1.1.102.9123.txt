sections provide short overviews projects discuss affective nature detail 
integrating models personality emotions lifelike characters basic concepts challenges face attempting affect architectures recognise fact term refer defined class phenomena clearly distinguishable mental behavioural events 
affect literature describe class motivational control states result valenced reactions objects events include emotions mood arousal 
generalisation really affect contain attributes activation valence 
different classes affective states differentiated duration focus intensity expression effect emotions tend closely associated specific event object short duration mood diffuse longer duration
