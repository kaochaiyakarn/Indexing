normally assumed properties react timely flexibly dynamic unexpected changes environment 
autonomous independent behaviour controlled external entity 
take initiative perform proactively actions may help reach goals 
communicate users agents 
exchange information engage complex negotiations coordinate activities cooperate joint resolution problem 
agents usually reasoning planning learning capabilities allow display intelligent behaviour 
multi agent system defined collection autonomous agents communicate coordinate activities order able solve collectively problem tackled agent individually 
years argued multi agent systems may considered latest software engineering paradigm 
kind system may domains features knowledge required solve problem spatially distributed different locations 
entities keeping autonomous behaviour join problem solving abilities able solve complex problem 
problems domain may decomposed different sub problems kind inter dependencies 
agent applications health care characteristics problems health care domain interesting note problems appear health care share number similarities 
noting similarities step finding framework may approach problems 
important characteristics problems medical field cite usual knowledge required solve problem spatially distributed different locations 
instance problem patient scheduling consists scheduling different tasks performed patient number different analysis tests 
normally unit hospital keeps information patients unit schedule activities unit equipment 
units provide services units hospital rays blood tests 
trivial coordinate schedule different tests performed different units especially apart temporal restrictions derived separate location different units medical restrictions tests test performed hours test 
solution problem involves coordination effort different individuals different skills functions usually supervision single centralised coordinator 
provision health care typically involves number individuals physicians nurses social workers managers located different places 
patients home hospital vacation health care providers number institutions locations institutions providing services diagnosis treatment surgery laboratory testing 
people coordinate activities provide best possible treatment patient 
health care problems quite complex finding standard software engineering solutions straightforward 
instance coordinating process organ transplant country easy task 
new organ available necessary find quickly appropriate receptor organ may located medical centre hundreds miles away donor location 
furthermore commented hospital keeps data patients hospital waiting list certain type organ 
quite difficult design implement centralised complex system standard decision aid expert system solve coordination problem 
years shift health care practice health care promotion shared patient provider decision making managed care creating increased demand information online services 
shared decisions actions concerned need coordinated sure care efficient effective

case aware new techniques treatments appearing field expertise practitioners lack time search information filter need exactly 
citizens demand active role management care want find relevant information easily possible usually lack skills search adequate knowledge relevant specific personal needs 
cases important receive appropriate information useful reliable sources proactive way having devote time effort look analyse evaluate filter 
adequacy agent systems health care problems argue multi agent systems offer appropriate tool tackle kind problems 
reasons support claim components multi agent system may running different machines located different places 
agents may keep part knowledge required solve problem patient records held different departments hospital hospitals clinics insurance government organisations 
multi agent systems offer natural way attacking inherently distributed problems 
main properties intelligent agent sociability 
agents able communicate kind agent communication language order exchange kind information 
way engage complex dialogues negotiate coordinate actions collaborate solution problem different units hospital may collaborate process patient scheduling 
agent applications health care problem complex solved single system usual decompose subproblems probably totally independent 
multi agent systems techniques distributed problem solving group agents may dynamically discuss partition problem distribute different subtasks solved exchange information solve possible dependences partial solutions combine partial results solution original problem 
multi agent systems handle complexity solutions decomposition modelling organising interrelationships components 
agents provide information doctors patients 
information agents called internet agents specialised retrieving information different sources analysing obtained data selecting information user especially interested filtering redundant irrelevant information presenting user interface adapted user preferences 
important property agents proactivity ability perform tasks may beneficial user explicitly demanded tasks executed 
property may find relevant information show user request 
instance knows user heart problems past need information urgently personal agent knows user travel abroad look information medical centres towns visited cardiology department 
basic characteristic intelligent agent autonomy 
agent takes decisions internal state information receives environment 
agents offer ideal paradigm implement systems component models behaviour separate entity wants keep autonomy independence rest system unit hospital may keep private data hospital may different policy rank patients waiting organ transplant 
think basic properties intelligent agents autonomy proactivity social ability features multi agent systems management distributed information communication coordination separate autonomous entities suggest offer option consider trying solve problems health care domains 
fields application health care intelligent agents proposed deal different kinds problems health care domain see rest chapters volume 
just give short list examples fields applied john antonio moreno patient scheduling patient appointment scheduling medical procedures complex tests treatments interrelated manual traditional software solutions shown inadequate multi agent solution gave significantly improved results 
complexities medical appointment scheduling successfully formalised implemented agent framework 
organ tissue transplant management agent coordination tissue organ hospital provide significant improvements time required pull resources required transplant operation 
approach feasible regional level hospital list waiting patients organ available region hospital transplant coordinators get touch quickly find appropriate recipient 
community care coordinating activities performed order provide efficient health care citizens community especially older disabled citizens 
agents provide remote care monitoring information groups elderly ill elderly care management system agent associated elderly person responsible receiving medical data giving reminders person alerting medical centre wrong 
information access deluge medical information available internet led development information agents collect organise information multi agent retrieval information networks marvin developed health net foundation swiss institute bioinformatics multi agent system helps manage uk national electronic library communicable diseases 
information agent user profile proactively performed role locating assessing retrieving filtering presenting information distributed sources periodic basis 
intelligent user interface adapt clinicians requirements characteristics patients records accessed uses multi agent framework coordinate possibly conflicting requirements 
implemented multi agent system provides mobile users information medical centres doctors available particular town lets user access medical record book visit examined doctor 
decision support systems distributed decision support system multi agent paradigm monitor status patient help diagnose state patient support operative medical decision making 
training agents help improve medical training education distance learning tutoring systems 
internal hospital tasks patient information retrieval workflow management agent communication techniques medical ontologies agent applications health care applied management patients suffering stroke 
cooperative multi agent framework support heterogeneous transaction workflow process people involved patient care management 
multi agent systems suggested monitoring application medical protocols controlling usage restricted antibiotics
