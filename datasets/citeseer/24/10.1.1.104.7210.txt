supposedly new approaches distributed computing emerged past years claiming address problem organizing large scale computational societies peer peer grid computing 
approaches seen rapid evolution widespread deployment successful application considerable hype certain amount warranted criticism 
technologies appear final objective pooling coordinated large sets distributed resources different communities current designs focus different requirements 
position take steps comparing contrasting grid computing 
basing discussion possible characteristics deployed systems claims abundant literature review target communities resources scale applications technologies 
basis review draw initial concerning interrelationship evolution 
brief argue concerned general problem organization resource sharing virtual communities take general approach solving problem creation overlay structures exist need correspond structure underlying organizational structures approach genuine technical advances current instantiations crucial limitations characterize simplistically believe usefully grid computing addresses infrastructure failure addresses failure infrastructure complementary nature strengths weaknesses approaches suggests interests communities grow closer time 
defining terms popularity grid led large number contradictory definitions 
assume grids sharing environments implemented deployment persistent standards service infrastructure supports creation resource sharing distributed communities 
resources computers storage space sensors software applications data connected internet middleware software layer provides basic services security monitoring resource management resources owned various administrative organizations shared locally defined policies specify shared allowed share conditions 
call set individuals institutions defined sharing rules virtual organization vo :10.1.1.129.8850
take definition class applications takes advantage resources storage cycles content human presence available edges internet 
accessing decentralized resources means operating environment unstable connectivity unpredictable ip addresses design requirements commonly include independence dns significant total autonomy central servers 
implementations frequently involve creation overlay networks structure independent underlying internet 
opt definition iptps announcement decentralized self organizing distributed systems communication symmetric allows include large scale deployed albeit centralized systems napster seti home experience gained 
comparing grids current grids provide services moderate sized communities emphasize integration substantial resources deliver nontrivial qualities service environment limited trust 
example nasa information power grid links supercomputers nasa laboratories 
contrast current systems deal participants hundreds thousands gnutella reported limewire offer limited specialized services concerned qualities service assumptions trust 
characterizations examples suggest commonality interest 
shall argue fact environments concerned general problem resource sharing vos may overlap existing organization 
clearly conceptual concrete distinctions types system attempt identify illuminate focusing noted characteristics deployed systems 
shall see distinctions result different target communities different evolutionary paths 
grids incrementally scaled deployment relatively sophisticated services application connecting small numbers sites collaborations engaged complex scientific applications 
system scale increases grid developers facing addressing problems relating autonomic configuration management 
communities developed rapidly unsophisticated popular services file sharing seeking expand sophisticated applications continuing innovate area large scale autonomic system management 
expect definition persistent multi purpose infrastructure emerge important theme 
target communities incentives development deployments grid technologies motivated initially requirements professional communities needing access remote resources federate datasets pool computers large scale simulations data analyses 
initially developed address needs scientific collaborations commercial interest growing 
participants contemporary grids form part established communities prepared devote effort creation operation required infrastructure exist degree trust accountability opportunities sanctions response inappropriate behavior 
time dynamic nature vo existence membership limited engagement vo participants circumscribe ability impose solutions individual sites local vo participants may limited authority administration 
contrast popularized grass roots mass culture music file sharing highly parallel computing applications scale instances hundreds thousands nodes 
communities underlie applications comprise diverse anonymous individuals little incentive act cooperatively 
example find file sharing applications providers consumers operators seti home devote significant effort detecting deliberately submitted incorrect results people tend intentionally resources :10.1.1.160.7346
rule enforcing mechanisms incentives behavior provided system section 
need alternative participation models example payment contracts markets licensing recognized systems standard practice :10.1.1.59.9607
resources general grid systems integrate resources powerful diverse better connected desktop edge internet constitutes typical resource 
grid resource cluster storage system database scientific instrument considerable value administered organized fashion defined policy 
explicit administration enhances resource ability deliver desired qualities service facilitate example software upgrades increase cost integrating resource grid 
diversity architecture policy publication resource properties important :10.1.1.10.4919
explicit administration higher cost membership stronger community links scientific vos mean resource availability tends high uniform 
contrast systems deal intermittent participation highly variable behavior example case mojo nation reported average connection time highly skewed sixth nodes connected :10.1.1.59.9607
grids integrate high resources desktop systems variable availability form major component contemporary grids :10.1.1.12.8273
ensemble resources grid treated undifferentiated swarm global scope 
aggregated administrative domains technologies condor create local resource pools integrated larger grids grid protocols computational resources 
resources grids traditionally research educational organizations tend powerful home computers arguably represent majority resources seti home systems home computers 
difference capabilities home computers illustrated average cpu time unit seti home home computers slower computers vs hours unit 
applications see considerable variation range scope scientific grid applications depending interest scale community question 
real demonstration examples mention portal providing remote access supercomputer hardware software numerical solution long open nug quadratic optimization problem hundreds computers sites system integrate earthquake engineering facilities national laboratory 
contrast systems tend vertically integrated solutions specialized resource sharing problems currently deployed systems share compute cycles files 
diversification comes differing design goals scalability anonymity availability :10.1.1.111.1818:10.1.1.140.3129:10.1.1.142.752:10.1.1.115.4299:10.1.1.10.4919:10.1.1.105.3673
significant point differentiation applications deployed grid systems tend far data intensive 
example analysis sloan digital sky survey data involved average mb input data cpu hour compact muon data analysis pipeline involves mb gb input data cpu hour 
contrast seti home moves orders magnitude data mere kb data cpu hour 
reason presumably part better network connectivity allows flexibility grid application design addition loosely coupled applications grids numerical simulation branch bound optimization problems :10.1.1.12.8273:10.1.1.15.9060
scale failure measure scale terms different dimensions number participating entities amount activity 
discussed necessity dealing failure seen intermittent participation collaboration imposed resource community characteristics 
dealing effectively automatically failure consequence prerequisite scaling dimensions 
community orientation scientific grid communities means involve modest numbers participants institutions tens pooled computers thousands simultaneous users hundreds 
example high energy physics collaboration shares analyzes data experiment spans institutions countries thousands scientists involved hundreds access resources data computers simultaneously 
amount activity hand large 
example half users submitted requests retrieved tb data 
consequence community characteristics early grid implementations address scalability self management priorities 
design core grid protocols instantiated globus toolkit preclude scalability actual deployments employ centralized components 
example find central repositories shared data centralized resource management components condor matchmaker centralized hierarchical information directories 
situation changing proceeding topics reliable scalable management large job pools distributed scheduling replica location discovery :10.1.1.10.4919:10.1.1.135.3823
scalable autonomic management remains goal accomplishment grid computing 
far larger communities exist millions simultaneous nodes case file sharing systems total nodes seti home :10.1.1.136.3479
amount activity significant albeit surprisingly larger relatively smaller scale grids tb day file sharing systems amounting half data transferred :10.1.1.136.3479
large scale emerged motivated robust self management large numbers nodes 
time systems evolved generation centralized structures napster index seti home second generation flooding gnutella file retrieval third generation systems distributed hash tables 
second generation collaborations characterized level individual nodes behavior resources network properties topological properties scale traffic revealing general resilience unexpected emergent properties :10.1.1.136.3479
third generation systems characterized primarily simulation studies large scale deployments :10.1.1.140.3129:10.1.1.105.3673
clear scalable autonomic management achieved significant extent albeit specific narrow domains 
services infrastructure technologies develop grid applications differ specific services provided emphasis placed persistent multi purpose infrastructure 
expended grid community technical organizational issues associated creating operating persistent multi purpose infrastructure services authentication authorization discovery resource access data movement forth :10.1.1.10.4919:10.1.1.26.255:10.1.1.25.9598
relatively self contained nature early grid communities effort devoted managing participation absence trust accounting reputation management forth issues increasingly discussed 
term persistent indicate services operated participants extended periods critical highly available infrastructure elements dns servers multi purpose indicate services different purposes monitoring discovery service wide range higher level functions computation scheduling data replication fault detection :10.1.1.10.4919
services operate overlays resources services maintained participating institutions 
overlay structures local mechanisms policies significant concern 
grid communities open source globus toolkit technology base 
significant effort standardization protocols interfaces enable interoperability different grid deployments 
open grid services architecture ogsa effort integrates grid web services technologies define service oriented architecture services adhere set standard interfaces behaviors required optional purposes service creation registry discovery lifecycle service data query notification reliable invocation :10.1.1.114.2815
systems tended focus integration simple resources individual computers protocols designed provide specific vertically integrated functionality 
example gnutella defines protocols search network maintenance 
protocols course define infrastructure general second third generation systems persistence properties infrastructures specifically engineered emergent properties 
time experience emergent properties revealed need new services anonymity censorship resistance incentives fair sharing reputation management result checking important issues tended arise date grid computing due different underlying trust assumptions 
jxta xtremweb proposed standard service infrastructure systems date seen little adoption interoperability 
example user participating gnutella kazaa seti home run completely independent applications computer coded scratch running protocols overlay networks 
lack interest standard infrastructure may derive simple nature current applications fact typical user encounter substantial administrative burden running multiple applications 
functionality requirements increase presumably benefits standard tooling infrastructure 
grid service requirements overlap regards important distinctions 
services specific particular regimes example mechanisms inherent lack incentives cooperation 
second functionality requirements conflict example grids require accountability systems anonymity 
third common services may start different hypotheses case trust 
directions grid concerned pooling coordinated resources distributed communities constructed overlay structures operate largely independently institutional relationships 
despite commonalities major differences communities incentives applications technologies resources achieved scale 
argue vision motivates grid computing worldwide computer access resources services negotiated needed come pass successful developing technology combines important elements today call grid computing 
technology address failure death fundamental level scalable self configuring protocols emerging research 
provide persistent multi purpose infrastructure cost justified amortized uses users dns routing tables supported organized distributed fashion exploit heterogeneity naturally occurring artificially imposed environment achieve goals robustness performance trust 
diverse discovery negotiation maintenance protocols constructed common base deliver wide spectrum services qualities service 
grid communities approaching different directions 
time scale grid systems increasing barriers participation lowered commercial deployments enable communities purely monetary transactions 
example international virtual data grid laboratory deploying scores sites thousands resources internationally interest growing utility computing models establish sharing relationships commercial transactions common interest 
trends lead greater need scalability trust negotiation self configuration automatic problem determination fault tolerance areas offer :10.1.1.135.3823
ogsa definition proceeding global grid forum early releases ogsa globus toolkit stimulating service definition implementation 
developers systems increasingly ambitious applications services result natural evolution powerful connected resources 
suspect developers systems going increasingly interested standard infrastructure tools service description discovery access standardized service definitions implementations able support different mixes logical physical organizations
