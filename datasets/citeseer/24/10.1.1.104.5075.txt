hierarchical faceted metadata hierarchical faceted metadata system creates set category hierarchies corresponds different facet dimension type 
main application hierarchical faceted metadata user interfaces browsing navigating collections items 
case recipe collection example facets may consist dish type salad appetizer ingredients fruits apple vegetables meat beef fish preparation method fry bake count 
decomposing description independent categories allows users move large information spaces flexible manner 
category metadata guides user possible choices organizes results keyword searches allowing users refine expand current query maintaining consistent representation collection structure 
metadata integrated free text search allowing user follow links add search terms follow links interrupting interaction flow

major class solutions creating subject hierarchies uses data clustering 
scatter gather system cutting uses greedy global agglomerative clustering algorithm initial set clusters recursively re clustered documents remain 
hofmann proposes probabilistic latent semantic analysis algorithm plsa probabilistic version clustering uses latent semantic analysis grouping words annealed em model fitting 
greatest advantage clustering fully automatable easily applied text collection 
clustering reveal interesting potentially unexpected new trends group documents 
disadvantages clustering include lack predictability conflation dimensions simultaneously difficulty labeling groups counter intuitiveness cluster sub hierarchies pratt

textual descriptions build facet hierarchies assign items documents images citations facets 
text need particularly coherent algorithm applied fragmented image annotations short journal titles text impoverished information items labeled thoroughly desirable additional manual annotation may needed 
algorithm major steps 
select target terms textual descriptions information items 

build core tree term term unambiguous see add synset path core tree 
increment counts node synset path number documents target term appears 

augment core tree remaining terms paths candidate path ambiguous term choose path document representation core tree 

compress augmented tree 

remove top level categories yielding set facet hierarchies 
describe step detail 
select target terms castanet selects subset terms called target terms intended best reflect topics documents 
similarly sanderson croft term distribution defined number item descriptions containing term selection criterion 
algorithm retains terms distribution larger threshold eliminates terms list 
word consecutive noun phrases eligible considered terms 
terms adjectives verbs nouns optionally deleted 
build core tree core tree acts backbone final category structure 
built paths derived unambiguous terms goal biasing final structure appropriate senses words 
entity substance matter food nutrient course dessert sweet frozen dessert ice cream entity substance matter food nutrient course dessert sweet frozen dessert entity substance matter food nutrient course dessert sweet ice cream merging hypernym paths 
disambiguate wordnet domains term considered unambiguous meets conditions term sense wordnet optional term matches pre selected wordnet domains see 
experiments half eligible terms sense wordnet 
rest terms disambiguate multiple senses follows 
wordnet provides cross categorization mechanism known domains synsets assigned general category labels 
small subset nouns wordnet domains assigned 
example medicine collection terms domains medicine biology associated 
reason additional resource called wordnet domains magnini assigns domains wordnet synsets 
resource noun synset wordnet semiautomatically annotated dewey decimal classification labels 
examples include history literature plastic arts zoology castanet wordnet domains follows 
system counts times domain represented target terms building list represented domains collection 
manual intervention step information architect selects subset represented domains meaningful collection question

currently cases algorithm breaks tie choosing sense lowest wordnet sense number corresponding common sense case selects anatomy sense 
see forced choice limitation plan explore allow term occurrence metadata hierarchies 
add paths core tree build core tree algorithm list unambiguous terms term looks synset hypernym path wordnet

add path core tree path merged paths placed tree 
shows hypernym paths synsets corresponding terms 
note hypernym path nodes common entity substance matter food nutrient course dessert sweet 
shared paths merged algorithm results paths shown 
addition augmenting nodes tree adding new term increases count associated node path count corresponds documents term occurs 
common term weight places path falls 
augment core tree disambiguate terms core tree contains subset terms collection path sense selected wordnet domains 
step add paths remaining target terms ambiguous wordnet 
core tree built bias paths appropriate collection 
confronted term multiple possible path choices ambiguous term 
paths corresponding multiple senses system favors common path alternatives 
assume want add term date core tree collection recipes currently paths corresponding senses core tree see 
decide paths merge date algorithm looks number items assigned deepest node held common existing core tree candidate path ambiguous term 
path calendar day sense fewer documents assigned corresponding terms day path edible fruit sense documents assigned 
date added fruit sense path 
counts ambiguous terms document hits incorporated new tree 
eliminate senses candidate sense hypernym path required share nodes nodes core tree user sets usually 
romantic appointment sense date considered hypernym path core tree 
path passes threshold sense hypernym path wordnet sense ordering placed tree 
compress tree tree obtained previous step usually deep undesirable user interface perspective 
castanet uses rules compressing tree 
starting leaves recursively eliminate parent fewer children parent root item count larger maximum term distribution 

eliminate child name appears parent name child contains wordnet domain name 
substance matter food nutrient food stuff food product ingredient implement herb herb entity brown sugar syrup sugar brown sugar syrup sugar object physical object artifact artefact instrumentality kitchen utensil eliminating top levels 
pot double boiler kitchen utensil pot double boiler example consider tree assume means eliminate parents fewer children 
starting leaves applying rule nodes ice cream course food nutrient substance matter entity eliminated child 
shows resulting tree 
applying rule node frozen dessert eliminated contains word dessert appears name parent
