overhead section discuss communication memory overheads 
study communication overhead considering phases 
phase uses broadcast originated node typically sink node identify nodes located boundary network 
practice effect phase rule select nodes similar technique bootstrap nodes locate perimeter nodes :10.1.1.154.6142
referring protocol case nodes don know location compare stages triangulation phase perimeter nodes phases :10.1.1.154.6142
perimeter node broadcast information perimeter nodes sufficient perimeter node broadcasts information nodes :10.1.1.154.6142
means practice may require number broadcasts steps worst case may require smaller number broadcasts average :10.1.1.154.6142
reduce number broadcasts required phase known technique trading time communication 
simple protocol requiring broadcast phase follows 
assume upper bound time needed propagate message network known nodes integer ids ranging number nodes network 
having received set message sink node node waits time equal generating elect message 
receives elect message node value greater equal avoids generate elect message 
time sink generates set message largest id nodes generates elect message time tj term accounts largest time set message may take reach note elect generated reach node time tj easy see node id generate elect message time tk tj generate elect 
means simple protocol require broadcast phase worst case may take time close complete 
practice effective approach delay generation elect messages random time chosen range 
clearly large range effect reducing number broadcasts increase latency protocol 
issue memory overhead 
protocol requires perimeter node store distance matrix matrix containing distances arbitrary pair perimeter nodes :10.1.1.154.6142
rough approximation number perimeter nodes implies distance matrix size 
clearly heavy burden protocol applied sensor networks 
furthermore size distance matrix reduced preventing perimeter node participate protocol solution appear scale contrary memory overhead constant requires node store assigned values protocol correctness analysis protocol previous section avoid nodes triplet coordinates
