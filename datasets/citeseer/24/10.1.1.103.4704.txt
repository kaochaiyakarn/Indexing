movement documents characterised speed automaticity 
example page turning condition anticipatory hand lifting page read minimising disruption reading text page 
automatic highlighted fact pages turned prematurely partly speeded movement hands combination afforded enabling effective interleaving overlapping activities 
example subjects hand keep hold page searching document referring page 
marking place hand subjects quickly return prior activity 
handed manipulation offered opportunities types interactions writing moving page closer read turning page hand feel pages left 
quick pages searching skimming quite clearly handed action hand anchor actions

line 
line condition scrolling paging document navigation slow distracting rendering pictures problem getting annoyed clicking things just took ages ages 
losing interest 
distracting point sheer length response time drawback 
feature limited quick movement fact handed input meant navigation activities performed serially activities 
combining single source input significant system response time meant interleaving activities cumbersome making impossible perform concurrently 
worse lack feedback response actions meant subjects supported temporarily committing various actions 
example subject tried get particular location document drag function scroll bar document contents move concurrently response dragging 
result subject release page icon wait find right place 
kind scrolling finding exact locations extremely time consuming 
spatial constraints interface interfered quick flexible movement 
example order move electronic window subjects required access title bar obscured window 
similar problems encountered subjects attempting resize windows scroll actions restricted limited active areas 
result subjects attention drawn away reading attended complicated task dealing mechanics moving spatially constrained ways 
documents assessing document length difficult incidental implicit way 
reasons just discussed subjects complained having scroll assess document length 
information document length page number available bottom active document subjects remembered information asked 
whilst subjects condition fixity information respect physical page support search interesting question page layout mode line condition similar purposes 
mode fixes contents document respect electronic page 
asked subjects said fact difficult view page meant little sense location information respect page 
comments subjects conditions suggested fixed relationship pictures text support navigation 
summary 
movement documents conditions important information organisation checking understanding 
ways movement differed navigation quick automatic interwoven reading 
line condition slow laborious reading 
handed movement allowed readers interleave overlap navigation activities allowed temporary commitment interim activities 
movement line documents required breaking away ongoing activity committing navigation activities handed accompanied immediate feedback spatially constrained active areas screen 
subjects reading tactile qualities support navigation implicitly assess document length

subjects placed greater angle away perpendicular approx 
degrees writing reading degrees 
additionally ergonomics writing pen required continuous minor adjustments time hand anchor 
line 
obvious constraint spatial layout restricted field view offered screen 
subjects multiple page view mode pages displayed resolution essentially unreadable 
readable resolution subjects see page time 
subjects expressed great deal concern trade talked feeling lost necessary contextual information developing sense text location cf 
lay window boundaries 
resizing overlapping windows subjects able cross referencing documents 
limitations space available lack flexibility ways laid caused problems quick access documents 
example occasions subjects wanted documents various parts task called small window sizes obscured windows 
page view allowed display multiple pages displayed fixed order 
lack real periphery meant subjects give thought selecting displaying documents 
generally speaking task divided discrete phases pass note summary writing 
window positioning sizing tended occur boundary different phases phases 
subjects having anticipate need reacting requirements task arose 
commonly arrangement especially writing phase placing documents side side minimal overlap 
avoided problems currently active window sent foreground time consuming undesired case subject trying alternate notes document navigating annoying got current window order able move current window front 
hide typing simply move pointer start typing pasting foreground background distinction constrained extent page accessible writing concurrently reading clearly important subjects 
summary 
laying pages space important gaining sense structure document referring documents integrating reading writing 
main differences conditions laying space allowed visualisation great deal information provided holding space quick documents 
restrictions field view line documents meant subjects lost resolution shrinking documents overlapping windows 
layout documents flexible dynamic providing quick access cross referencing supporting juxtaposition documents reading writing

digital technologies offer interesting advantages allowing readers choose annotations permanent temporary offering selective viewing capabilities wrote marks allowing marks effect changes underlying text desired 
features prototype collaborative writing system called mate 
systems offer ability highlight text features revisions microsoft word support collaborative authoring commercial systems tend offer limited support annotation reading purpose re reading 
need support quicker effortless navigation techniques 
improvements system response times clearly benefit line navigation range issues need addressed quick non disruptive ongoing reading activities 
improved input techniques significant impact 
multiple input handed input support range new navigation techniques hand mark place document scrolling page turning 
allow support concurrent activities writing document navigating 
multiple input raises design possibility kind input depend device 
example drawing directly case direct input touch correspond navigation activities stylus input produce markings 
major design issue findings help clear need better feedback aid navigation 
need immediate support quick interim actions needs continuous course action simply delivered completion releasing mouse button dragging 
modes feedback audio tactile feedback provide implicit cues document information example imagine non speech audio cues indicate thickness document number pages left 
feedback provided natural course navigation cues picked incidentally 
say visual cues exploited 
perspective stereoscopic displays may offer third dimension better represent features document thickness example 
additional consideration support navigation heavier reliance mode fixes information respect page 
study suggests benefit provided page viewed previous research suggests may 
designers consider emphasising endemic points page corners edges information search 
need support flexibility control spatial layout 
regard issue spatial layout study points benefits larger screen size 
improvements display technology mean cheaper larger display areas increased resolution 
improve readers ability gain quick access documents shown crucial kind reading task 
large screen sufficient offer reader level flexibility terms document positioning number documents displayed 
approach create virtual space visible screen space forms part workspace available unix hypercard 
applications documents moved larger virtual workspace separate overview 
offers advantage potentially help manage extremely large workspaces practically possible domain 
fundamentally different case focus attention periphery exists spatial continuum 
electronic cases peripheral documents documents focus attention exist separate virtual spaces 
drawing new document focus setting aside requires shift attention different representational space dynamics necessarily take time effort 
spontaneous dynamics spatial layout may facilitated improvements interaction techniques 
example designers consider doing away idea constraining document movement active areas title bars 
various window managers current systems allow document active motif window manager unix 
done requiring users enter navigation mode 
consistent previous suggestion need temporal modes handled multiple specialist input devices hand versus stylus 
implication arises experiment need increased flexibility way readers arrange line documents space available 
ranges simple suggestions removing constraints readers ability lay pages side side possibility placing documents pages angles 
allowing readers virtual piles interesting idea interface designers tried 
alternative approach increasing flexibility spatial layout treat portable wireless displays way providing physical embodiment documents 
documents placed moving display moving documents display 
displays approach address requirement providing concurrent access multiple documents pages 
experiment pointed effectiveness independent reading writing spaces domain 
displays reading writing deliver valuable benefits 
broadly descriptive approach carried laboratory study draws attention number important implications design better interfaces reading digital documents 
study motivated field studies reading real settings design experiment grounded guided observations 
turn findings help understand observed reading practices organisations 
example gives better understanding economists imf mark review colleagues documents choose read important documents documents surround workstations authoring
