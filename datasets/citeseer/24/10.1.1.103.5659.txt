effects insufficient data quality classified effects data warehousing projects effects decision processes effects operative processes 
expensive search right correct values additional efforts create reports analysis multiple acquisitions data special transformation logic data cleansing algorithms additional efforts designing operating data warehouse effects data warehousing projects resulting additional efforts higher project costs 
data warehouse specialist accepted broadly 
furthermore insufficient data quality results reduced internal acceptance data warehousing project operating reliable authentic 
expected benefits achieved internal project support lost 
data warehouse general create analysis reports supporting decision processes practice incorrect meaningless incomprehensible statistics analysis reports exists 
insufficient analytical information lead deficient decisions lack external reporting accounting 
deficient decisions insufficient information result inadequate strategies accumulation risks inadequate customer orientation inadequate pricing policy 
st ch switzerland markus ch effects operative processes multiple 
example insufficient inaccurate information customer relationship management electronic commerce customers resulting complaints lost customers 
falsely predicted customer behavior selling potentials identified wrong customer target groups advertised inadequate promotions 
cross selling potentials misinterpreted identified 
incorrect accounts falsely calculated resulting reduced external image bad reputation leads narrow turnover 
showing examples insufficient data quality surprisingly data quality identified major problems data warehousing

data quality data warehousing 
data quality definition discussion literature information data data quality shows terms complex widely accepted definition exists 
numerous approaches defining information quality data quality respective information quality necessary clarify terms 
approaches distinguish data information define data quality information quality equal 
suitable definition knowledge information data described basis dimensions main approaches economic literature dimensions semiotic medium novelty verity timeliness shown 
timeliness static verity process oriented semiotic syntax semantic pragmatic human dimensions information novelty unbound medium human unbound approaches distinguished dimension medium 
human approaches information exists humans unbound approaches considering books hard discs 
cognitive interpretation process matching real world objects done humans expressed information specified intended meaning 
reason article comprises information representations stored transferred medium 
information approaches subjective novelty new information consumers inter subjective objective approaches information independent subject previous knowledge 
character information verified individual case subjective approaches tend operational objective ones 
objective approach define information characteristics independent single cases 
approaches qualified purpose measuring information data quality subjective ones 
verity approaches distinguished truth independent approaches 
truth dependent approaches information true approaches verity irrelevant 
static process oriented approaches forming dimension timeliness 
process oriented approaches considering information process information acquiring 
hand static approaches define information state input result information processes 
semiotics provides framework consisting levels syntax semantic pragmatic bottom level framework syntax considers basic representation information 
level deals technical context syntactical concerns comprises characters symbols signals 
basic representation summarized term signals comprising symbolic representation regardless meaning 
level semantic level deals related real world objects implies meaning signals 
pragmatic level top level deals information processes information users 
information usage purpose impact information process information user 
framework provided semiotics gives basic structure different levels information 
level includes previous levels transition levels fuzzy subjective 
information article defined knowledge expressed human language knowledge represents real world objects 
information defined subset knowledge 
definition information characterized dimensions unbound objective truth independent static semantic level 
definition data defined subset information processed machines 
term quality complex term information approach widely adopted quality literature focused consumer product fitness 
approach comprises aspects quality 
quality means product characteristics meet customer needs provide customer satisfaction second absence deficiencies result customer dissatisfaction aspect refers quality design second quality conformance 
quality design addresses aspect information requirements information product design 
requirements met information product design 
conformance final information product product design addressed quality conformance 
quality conformance take divergence design final product consideration 
low quality design low quality conformance different causes different solutions considered differently 
high quality design mean high quality conformance vice versa 
increasing quality design tends result higher costs increasing quality conformance tends results lower costs 
addition higher conformance means fewer complains increased customer satisfaction 
data quality measurement consider aspects quality

data quality framework management information technology literature currently information quality frameworks approaches measuring data quality table summarizes selection information quality frameworks various contexts 
frameworks large number information quality criteria lists 
evaluation frameworks criteria lists shows lack quality indicators measurement systems

measuring system techniques assigning values quality criteria integrated framework 
huang suggesting measuring system information quality consisting metrics 
metric measures individual subjective estimates information quality suggested 
metric consists questionnaire simple information user understandable questions 
information user questioned subjective estimation information quality context information usage 
second metric measures information quality quantifiable objective variables application independent proposed 
metric basically established theory controlling quality data entering 
examples objective variables correctness completeness consistency 
third metric measures information quality quantifiable objective variables suggested 
third measurement needs knowledge information application formats 
questionnaire scales form example information complete information incorrect subjective assessment objective application independent established theory controlling quality data entering referential integrity completely quantifiable objective application dependent domain specific require domain experts participation example percentage incorrect client address zip code randomly selected customer accounts inaccuracy percentage nonexistent accounts number accounts missing values industry code field incompleteness measuring system proposed huang proposed measuring system summarised applies different metrics measuring information quality research done
