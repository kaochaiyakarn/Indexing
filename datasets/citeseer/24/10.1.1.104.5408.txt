overview fact system 
describe general problem finding associations association discovery query language algorithms executing queries language 
discuss fact collection reuters newswire stories background knowledge automatically extracted cia world factbook 
fact system architecture fact takes input sources information 
collection textual data discovery process takes place 
approach begins assumption borrowed information retrieval literature document labeled set keywords representing topics document input text collections labeled keywords case reuters data discussed section fed text categorization system annotates documents keywords 
addition fact takes input background knowledge discovery process 
usable fact knowledge define unary binary predicates keywords labeling documents representing properties entities represented keyword relationships 
reuters newswire data example fact told organizations country mem ber defining set unary predicates country keywords organization 
fact information countries neighbor defining set binary predicates 
information rarely available precise form needed fact system usually necessary develop tools understand format information source translate necessary format fact 
example background knowledge reuters newswire experiments comes cia world factbook structured textual document information various countries world 
possible fact knowledge develop tool parses factbook structured text converts format fact 
fact provided user specification knowledge discovery task acquired user simple graphical user interface 
interface knows various keywords label document various unary binary predicates defined background knowledge applied keywords allows user specify query keyword predicate vocabulary collection menus 
results discovery process passed tool effectively results allow user browse 
component fact filters redundant results feldman sorts results decreasing order confidence enables user access browse documents support individual results presents user 
query language execute association discovery task user specifies query fact association query language association discovery process return results satisfy query association discovery query parts 
part specifies types keywords desired left hand right hand sides associations support confidence association 
example user express interest associations relate set countries labeling document person labeling document long association sufficient support confidence collection 
second possibly empty part query specifies constraints terms predicates defined background knowledge user wants association satisfy 
types background knowledge queries 
unary cates keywords 
specifying query unary predicate viewed class keywords specifying set keywords true 
example unary predicate ec true keyword name country member european community viewed class members keywords european community countries 
user request unary predicate true keyword association specifying keyword member class defined unary predicate 
second type background knowledge queries binary predicates define relationships keywords 
example background knowledge define binary predicate nationality true argument name person nationality country appearing second argument predicate 
query language binary predicate viewed function value argument returns set values second argument predicate true 
predicate nationality example viewed function takes person name input returns country person nationality predicate function export commodities takes country keyword input outputs keywords representing country export commodities 
function applied set keywords function returns second arguments predicate true element input set keywords 
user request binary predicate true keywords association specifying keyword values returned function applied keyword association 
third possibly empty part query specifies constraints size various components association 
example user request associations keyword right hand side mention country keywords 
gives bnf grammar query language nonterminals written angle brackets represents set reals inclusive defined appropriate domain dividing keywords labeling documents subclasses country person reuters newswire data

query find support confidence pattern support integer confidence pattern varlist varlist varlist varlist var typeexp typeexp arg operator arg operator arg var keyword class lhs rhs arg arg exp exp exp numeric constant category lhs rhs bnf grammar query language fact example query find country person nationality lhs taken reuters newswire domain requests associations time set countries labels document labeled person nationality countries occurs times collection 
query execution algorithms executing association discovery queries presence background knowledge described agrawal srikant mannila 
collection covers called cover traditional association discovery process attempts find subsets cover holds desired confidence 
limit search associations satisfying constraints cover algorithm slightly different fashion constraints reduce search space association generation process efficient 
divide constraints possible associations classes 
class contains simple constraints refer side association lhs league iran rhs constraints require property hold association 
second class contains complex constraints require relationship hold elements side association rhs lhs 
classes constraints reduce space possible covers considered 
gives outline algorithm finding associations presence constraints 
takes input collection documents ds refer collection keywords labeling document algorithm finds possible lhs candidates searching satisfy simple constraints lhs 
result algorithm considers keywords appear rhs association constrained additional constraints 
process determines associations satisfy support confidence created satisfying constraints 
cover algorithm create ls set lefthand sides satisfy association discovery query constrained consider keywords satisfying simple constraints lhs 
ds ls keywords satisfy constraints rhs simple constraints composite constraints appear required support 
update occurrence counters subsets form associations accumulated occurrence counters 
remove associations satisfy required support confidence 
query evaluation algorithm applying fact newswire data investigate fact find associations text reuters newswire data research information retrieval 
goal just discovery associations text doing presence background knowledge domain 
investigate role background knowledge association discovery reuters collection background knowledge extracted cia world factbook structured textual document containing information countries world 
information country divided sections people government economy communications defense forces 
crude measure efficiency algorithms ran series queries fact compared cpu time number associations query 
query created instantiating query templates 
template includes background knowledge constraint requires righthand side association land boundaries left hand side find country country 
generate query replaced template country organizations defined background knowledge 
second query generated way identical template constraint find country country shows graph giving cpu time took fact evaluating queries country organizations queries generated template produced associations execution time giving fewer associations negligible excluded avoid cluttered graph nearly zero values 
gives graph shows country organization number associations produced query 
organizations listed axis ordered identically graphs number results generated instantiation template
