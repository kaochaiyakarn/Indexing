world wide web provides vast source information types ranging dna databases resumes lists favorite restaurants 
information scattered web servers hosts di erent formats 
chunks information extracted world wide web integrated structured form form unprecedented source information 
include largest international directory people largest diverse databases products greatest bibliography academic works useful resources 
considerable integrating number information sources specially coded wrappers lters tsi mos 
time consuming create usually tens thousands sources 
address problem extracting relation thousands sources may hold pieces relation world wide web 
goal discover information sources extract relevant information entirely automatically minimal human intervention 
consider problem extracting relation books author title pairs web 
intuitively solution works follows 
small seed set author title pairs tests set just books 
nd occurrences books web 
occurrences recognise patterns citations books 
web patterns nd new books 
take books nd occurrences generate patterns 
new patterns nd books forth 
eventually obtain large list books patterns nding
