subdue expects graph input database needs represented graph passing subdue 
graph representation includes vertex edge labels directed undirected edges objects data usually map vertices relationships attributes map edges see example 
subdue discovery algorithm discovers interesting repetitive substructures input graph 
graph hierarchical conceptual clustering algorithm begins empty lattice calls subdue find substructure maximally compresses input graph achieves compression added lattice compress graph compressed graph passed subdue find substructure 
iterative approach successively compressed graphs allows subdue find new substructures defined terms previously discovered substructures 
substructures added lattice parents may include non root nodes lattice 
substructure composed previously discovered substructures links parent child lattice 
subdue discovery algorithm discovers substructures input graph 
subdue uses beam search starting single node subgraphs incrementally expands substructures best far 
expansion process substructure expanded possible ways neighboring vertices instances new substructures 
discovery process continues iteratively possible subgraphs considered algorithm reaches userspecified limit 
best substructure graph compressed process starts finding best substructure 
search guided minimum description length mdl principle originally developed rissanen rissanen 
evaluation heuristic best substructure minimizes description length graph compressed substructure 
compressing graph instances substructure replaced single vertex pointer substructure definition 
approach imposes hierarchy database successive iteration 
definition best substructure single iteration yields description cluster 
identifying cluster inserted classification lattice see 
previous works clustering suggested classification trees structured domains strict tree representation inadequate 
realized certain domains lattice structure emerges tree 
subdue searches hypothesis space classification lattices 
iteration search process numerous local minima encountered global minimum tends minima 
clustering purposes local minimum best partial hypothesis 
reason easy see 
subdue starts single vertex instances unique substructures iteratively expands best ones single vertex 
local minimum encountered caused smaller substructure instances local minimum larger fewer instances 
smaller substructure general larger parent node classification lattice specific clusters 
entirely possible global minimum best substructure global minimum local minimum may produce overlapping clusters 
overlapping clusters include information 
example particular clustering vehicles domain clusters may include information number wheels 
suggests better clustering may constructed information part cluster higher level
