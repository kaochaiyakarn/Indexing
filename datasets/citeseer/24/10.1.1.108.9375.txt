major alternatives probable informative scheme exhibited considerably improved performances alternative schemes 
system performs quite wide spectrum users tested wide variety target images

comparing algorithms performances target testing scheme implicit assumption systems optimized target testing condition perform category searches open ended browsing 
reported experiments support assumption target testing version form category searching section 
performance open ended browsing difficult quantify vague nature task hand 
main requirement open ended browsing system display images similar selected user avoid displaying images similar images resulting appropriate changes display updating scheme 
time goal changes search user allowed reset memory goal change earlier choices longer affect display updating decisions 
highly desirable rank order various criteria humans judging image similarity importance 
weights assigned criteria role play predicting judgment similarity humans 
relevant research carried application multidimensional scaling mds methods finding principal attributes characterize texture perception 
image processing research conducted utilizing texture pictorial feature cbir systems

approach expected handle millions images today technological environment hundreds millions 
approximating bayesian update sublinear number user model executions feature vectors secondary storage represents interesting area theoretical systems 
demonstrated search times shorter brute force clearly short satisfy users 
possible pure relevance feedback approach lead fully acceptable system possible hybrid approach prove best 
involves explicit querying uses relevance feedback shorten search 
experiments indicate humans attend semantic content images judging similarity 
highly specialized databases medical image databases large medical centers started get semantically annotated trend appears carry images generic electronic libraries 
searching image common searching text documents library databases 
experiments experienced users performed level considerably better users little experience expected 
example completed average search visiting respectively images visited time users experiments reported sections vii 
noted time users improve scores substantially explained algorithm user model section vi 
training brief lasting min performance improved reducing search length 
substantial improvement minimal training users desirable feature search engine enabling development short line training session time users 
published papers provide data search length terms iterations needed users find image similar desired target 
may reliable measure random search produce relatively short search lengths shown experiments section column rand table ii 
fact search length baseline measure performance algorithm test 
better believe data target search paradigm offer objective measure performance 
addition measure exhibits small standard deviations users scores user score averaged adequately large number searches different targets corresponding random search baseline measure exhibits higher variability 
target testing requires experiments fewer users establish degree confidence statistics
