polymorphic types haskell incorporates polymorphic types types universally quantified way types 
polymorphic type expressions essentially describe families types

lazy patterns useful contexts infinite data structures defined recursively 
example infinite lists excellent vehicle writing simulation programs context infinite lists called streams

type classes overloading final feature haskell type system sets apart programming languages 
kind polymorphism talked far commonly called parametric polymorphism 
kind called ad hoc polymorphism better known overloading 
examples ad hoc polymorphism literals represent fixed arbitrary precision integers 
numeric operators defined different kinds numbers 
haskell observes convention tabs count blanks care taken editor may observe convention 
type classes overloading equality operator haskell usually works numbers types 
note overloaded behaviors different type fact behavior undefined error parametric polymorphism type truly matter fringe example really doesn care kind elements leaves tree 
haskell type classes provide structured way control ad hoc polymorphism overloading 
start simple important example equality 
types equality defined 
example comparing equality functions generally considered computationally intractable want compare lists equality 
highlight issue consider definition function elem tests membership list elem false elem ys elem ys stylistic reason discussed section chosen define elem infix form 
infix operators equality logical respectively 
intuitively speaking type elem ought bool 
imply type bool just said don expect defined types 
furthermore noted earlier defined types comparing lists equality different comparing integers 
sense expect overloaded carry various tasks 
type classes conveniently solve problems 
allow declare types instances class provide definitions overloaded operations associated class 
example define type class containing equality operator class eq bool eq name class defined single operation class 
declaration may read type instance class eq overloaded operation appropriate type defined note defined pairs objects type 
constraint type instance class eq written eq eq type expression expresses constraint type called context 
contexts placed front type expressions 
example effect class declaration assign type eq bool read type instance class eq type bool 
type elem example constraint imposed context propagates principal type elem elem eq bool read type instance class eq elem type bool 
just want expresses fact elem defined types just know compare elements equality 
kind equality referring value equality opposed pointer equality example java 
pointer equality referentially transparent sit purely functional language 
type classes overloading far 
specify types instances class eq actual behavior types 
done instance declaration 
example instance eq integer definition called method 
function happens primitive function compares integers equality general valid expression allowed right hand side just function definition 
declaration essentially saying type integer instance class eq definition method corresponding operation declaration compare fixed precision integers equality 
similarly instance eq float allows compare floating point numbers 
recursive types tree defined earlier handled instance eq eq tree leaf leaf branch branch false note context eq line necessary elements leaves type compared equality second line 
additional constraint essentially saying compare trees equality long know compare equality 
context omitted instance declaration static type error result 
haskell report especially prelude contains wealth useful examples type classes 
class eq defined slightly larger defined earlier class eq bool example class operations equality inequality 
demonstrates default method case inequality operation 
method particular operation omitted instance declaration default defined class declaration exists 
example instances eq defined earlier perfectly class declaration yielding just right definition inequality want logical negation equality 
haskell supports notion class extension 
example may wish define class ord inherits operations eq addition set comparison operations minimum maximum functions class eq ord bool max min note context class declaration 
say eq superclass ord conversely ord subclass eq type instance ord instance eq 
section give fuller definition ord taken prelude 
benefit class inclusions shorter contexts type expression function uses operations eq ord classes context ord type classes overloading eq ord ord implies eq 
importantly methods subclass operations assume existence methods superclass operations 
example ord declaration standard prelude contains default method example ord principal typing quicksort defined section quicksort ord words quicksort operates lists values ordered types 
typing quicksort arises comparison operators definition 
haskell permits multiple inheritance classes may superclass 
example declaration class eq show creates class inherits operations eq show 
class methods treated top level declarations haskell 
share namespace ordinary variables name denote class method variable methods different classes 
contexts allowed data declarations see 
class methods may additional class constraints type variable defining current class 
example class class show method requires type class show 
method place additional class constraints type part context class declaration 
far order types 
example type constructor tree far paired argument tree integer tree containing integer values tree representing family trees containing values 
tree type constructor takes type argument returns type result 
values haskell type higher order types class declarations 
consider functor class taken prelude class functor fmap fmap function generalizes map function previously 
note type variable applied types expect bound type tree applied argument 
instance functor type tree instance functor tree fmap leaf leaf fmap branch branch fmap fmap instance declaration declares tree tree instance functor 
capability quite useful demonstrates ability describe generic container types allowing functions fmap uniformly arbitrary trees lists data types 
type applications written manner function applications

similarly types 
tuples type constructors data constructors 
know type system detects typing errors expressions 
errors due malformed type expressions 
expression results type error takes arguments 
similarly type tree int int produce sort error tree type takes single argument 
haskell detect malformed type expressions 
answer second type system ensures correctness types 
type associated kind ensures type correctly 
type expressions classified different kinds take possible forms symbol represents kind type associated concrete data objects 
value type kind 
kinds kind types take type kind return type kind 
type constructor tree kind type tree int kind

kinds appear directly haskell programs 
compiler infers kinds doing type checking need kind declarations 
kinds stay background haskell program erroneous type signature leads kind error 
kinds simple compilers able provide descriptive error messages kind conflicts occur 
see information kinds 
different perspective 
going examples type classes worth pointing views haskell type classes 
analogy object oriented programming oop 
general statement oop simply substituting type class class type object yields valid summary haskell type class mechanism classes capture common sets operations 
particular object may instance class method corresponding operation 
classes may arranged hierarchically forming notions superclasses subclasses permitting inheritance operations methods 
default method may associated operation contrast oop clear types objects particular notion object type internal mutable state 
advantage oop languages methods haskell completely type safe attempt apply method value type required class detected compile time runtime 
words methods looked runtime simply passed higher order functions 
different perspective gotten considering relationship parametric ad hoc polymorphism 
shown parametric polymorphism useful defining families types universally quantifying types 
universal quantification broad wish quantify smaller set types types elements compared equality 
type classes seen providing types structured way just 
think parametric polymorphism kind overloading 
just overloading occurs implicitly types constrained set types type class 
comparison languages 
classes haskell similar object oriented languages java 
significant differences haskell separates definition type definition methods associated type 
class java usually defines data structure member variables functions associated structure methods 
haskell definitions separated 
class methods defined haskell class correspond virtual functions class 
instance class provides definition method class defaults correspond default definitions virtual function base class 
haskell classes roughly similar java interface 
interface declaration haskell class declaration defines protocol object defining object 
haskell support overloading style functions different types share common name

java attach identifying information vtable runtime representation object 
haskell information attached logically physically values type system 
access control public private class constituents built haskell class system 
module system hide reveal components class 
types examine advanced aspects type declarations 
newtype declaration common programming practice define type representation identical existing separate identity type system 
haskell newtype declaration creates new type existing 
example natural numbers represented type integer declaration newtype natural integer creates entirely new type natural constructor contains single integer 
constructor converts natural integer types integer natural error create negative naturals 
natural integer instance declaration admits natural num class instance num natural frominteger error unnatural subtraction declaration natural num 
instances declared old type carry new

newtype avoids extra level indirection caused laziness data declaration introduce 
see section report discussion relation newtype data type declarations

field labels fields haskell data type accessed name field labels 
consider data type dimensional point data point pt float float components point second arguments constructor pt

field names identify components constructor name position 
alternative way define point data point pt float data type identical earlier definition point

declaration defines field names 
field names selector functions extract component structure 
example selectors point float point float types function selectors point float sqrt field labels construct new values

field names declaration data constructor preclude positional style field access pt pt allowed 
constructing value field names fields may omitted absent fields undefined 
pattern matching field names uses similar syntax constructor pt pt sqrt update function uses field values existing structure fill components new structure 
point point replaced 
destructive update update function merely creates new copy object filling specified fields new values 
braces conjunction field labels somewhat special haskell syntax usually allows braces omitted layout rule described section

strict data constructors data structures haskell generally lazy components evaluated needed 
permits structures contain elements evaluated lead error fail terminate 
lazy data structures enhance expressiveness haskell essential aspect haskell programming style 
internally field lazy data object wrapped structure commonly referred thunk encapsulates computation defining field value 
thunk entered input output value needed thunks contain errors affect elements data structure 
example tuple perfectly legal haskell value

programming languages strict lazy components data structure reduced values placed structure 
number overheads associated thunks take time construct evaluate occupy space heap cause garbage collector retain structures needed evaluation thunk 
avoid overheads strictness flags data declarations allow specific fields constructor evaluated immediately selectively suppressing laziness 
field marked data declaration evaluated structure created delayed thunk 
number situations may appropriate strictness flags structure components sure evaluated point program execution 
structure components simple evaluate cause errors 
types partially undefined values meaningful 
example complex number library defines complex type data complex note infix definition constructor 
definition marks components real imaginary parts complex number strict 
compact representation complex numbers comes expense making complex number undefined component example totally undefined 
real need partially defined complex numbers sense strictness flags achieve efficient representation 
strictness flags may address memory leaks structures retained garbage collector longer necessary computation

monad contains primitives build composite actions process similar joining statements sequential order languages 
monad serves glue binds actions program

actions return interesting values unit type

unit type similar void languages 
actions sequenced operator cryptic name bind 
operator directly choose syntactic sugar notation hide sequencing operators syntax resembling conventional languages 
notation trivially expanded described

prelude libraries contains functions useful sequencing actions 
usually generalized arbitrary monads function context including monad works io type 
exception handling far avoided issue exceptions operations 
happen getchar encounters file 
deal exceptional conditions file monad handling mechanism similar functionality standard ml 
special syntax semantics exception handling part definition sequencing operations 
errors encoded special data type ioerror 
type represents possible exceptions may occur monad 
type constructors ioerror available user 
predicates allow ioerror values queried 
example function ioerror bool determines error caused file condition 
making ioerror new sorts errors may added system noticeable change data type 
function defined separate library io explicitly imported program 
exception handler type ioerror io catch function associates exception handler action set actions catch io ioerror io io arguments catch action handler 
action succeeds result returned invoking handler 
error occurs passed handler value type term error condition recovered non termination pattern match failure 
exceptions hand caught handled monad 
input output ioerror action associated handler invoked 
example version getchar returns newline error encountered getchar io char getchar getchar catch return crude treats errors manner 
file recognized error value queried getchar io char getchar getchar catch return ioerror ioerror function throws exception exception handler 
type ioerror ioerror ioerror io similar return transfers control exception handler proceeding action 
nested calls catch permitted produce nested exception handlers 
getchar redefine getline demonstrate nested handlers getline io string getline catch getline err return error show err getline getchar return getline return nested error handlers allow getchar catch file error results string starting error getline 
convenience haskell provides default exception handler topmost level program prints exception terminates program
