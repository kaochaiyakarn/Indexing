important point mobile workers concerned places worked detailed organisation structure differences 
mobile workers working homogenous standardised sites reality individuals intimately concerned different places 
different places gave workers different possibilities configuring reconfiguring relationships different possibilities performing actions different possibilities habitual action meaning identity attached place 
important characteristics places people 
main reason mobile workers mobile meet people face face 
boden points face face meeting paramount means communication organisations boden 
affordances different places crucial actions individuals carry places turn meaning endowed places 
people places dependent humble office equipment available places network connections 
example participant mentioned access email palm top mobile phone 
suggested email train newcastle london 
unpacked issue interview clear actual practice reflect 
mobile devices create relationship email extremely rarely 
slow network connection downloading time excessively slow particularly attachments involved 
small display pda meant appropriate thoughtful relationship established information email making reading responding difficult 
mobile devices allowing form sort relationship email train nature relationships train defined place activity realistically done 
happened kind activity deferred location necessary relationships achieved organisational offices network connection fast manage simple way train site 
point constraints place impact kind activities usefully carried 
train mobile workers needed form activity reading making telephone calls 
turn activities activities fit places 
done office reading train 
respect see place important determinant ordering activities mobile worker 
specifically example mobile workers deliberately saved reading plane journey 
think just ones plus sort reading type material background reading ll flight opportunity doing hour worth background reading 
know saved days doing working day just thought ll put side doing working day plane 
probably extracts plus stuff read plane couple days stuff sort normally read just sort save journey reading taken place reasonably quiet location 
nature activity relatively characteristics particular place 
contrast activities carried office left trip order exploit richer features place necessary task 
example episodes described mobile workers certain locations particular periods time associated defining place experienced relation 
instance experiences aeroplane simply issue seat limited space defined fact worker going place number hours 
worker place settle prolonged uninterrupted engagement reading materials possible transient locations find 
worker discussed get laptop boarding lounge time associated relationship place possible sit laptop time spent place get tasks done laptop 
accordingly checked voice mail phone calls airport lounge 
mobile worker inherent uncertainties associated places impact choices kinds activities pursue 
mail example simply reliable different places visited 
illustrated remarks participant exploit times connection just particularly experiencing difficulties anticipating ll things ll depends country unreliable country hungary hard get mails definitely office usually better secure line get 
problems getting mails ll know going hit put morning ll run get machine set ll run times ll go breakfast ll come back hopefully hit times managing uncertainty places particular affordances relation certain kinds activities particular concern people interviewed 
practices shaped ecologically flexible 
example active files stored locally laptops networked servers copies taken back attachments sent multiple email accounts communication channels directed accessible phone voice mail voicemail accessible far places geographically mail car airport home opposed mail needs office time 
quicker connect listen respond 
personal urgent issue tend voice mail just dumping mail 
chance people listening responding voice mail mail mobile worker simply orient place isolation places 
see example orientation place terms activities performed knock consequences subsequent place afford certain opportunities 
engage decision arcs respect place normally try find spot power outlet wasn important hour long flight usually longer flight 
great airports executive clubs power outlets set know access particularly re just airport don really want executive club got half hour ll half hour computer 
hour flight battery going time plug basically wasting time plane try hunt try find place true say location unique viewed sufficient level detail duplication technology different sites implies certain standardisation environments 
locations share core infrastructure turn offer possibilities activity 
somewhat narrow similarity places important mobile workers 
office wanted able offices 
office equipment important consideration mentioned important aspect different places people colleagues clients 
main reason mobile workers mobile meet different people 
theme continually brought workers interviewed deliberate regular efforts visit main office base specific task reason 
going office just schedule meetings unplanned social contact important 
example feature ongoing development personal expertise knowledge 
learning necessarily explicit planned simply learning people knowledge serendipitous interaction colleagues 
plan interactions predict kind knowledge going pick connections invaluable 
accordingly motivation mobile workers put position increase likelihood bumping workers 
networking seen bread butter terms long term development knowledge bring bear current situations 
noted try home disturbed sitting hot desk get dragged discussions meetings 
difficult balance impromptu meetings important come partly social stuff want feel part team want bounce idea 
overhear exact problem project help 
networking knowledge gathering important consulting 
biggest things reuse knowledge respect office appears place akin local pub caf 
defines local pub place generic pub associated likelihood meeting familiar people 
people necessarily know exactly place defined likelihood potential relationships members local group 
configurational properties relationship people exact location important 
pub office common understanding community people location gives particular office configurational properties define place 
similar lines reason mobile workers go back office place available interaction 
putting particular configurational relationship people allow people opportunity certain type interaction available move away office 
particularly case senior workers playing supervisory role 
participant explained visited office choose place visually open people knew 
people see interpret choice location invitation interruption 
example chosen quiet rooms different meaning employees 
choice place means communication rest team availability 
allowed engage face face interaction simply knew office 
addition choose sit different places office order place closer people need opportunity speak 
way participants choose locations encouraged allowed interactions initiated relevant 
configuration respect configurability created sense place people terms potential actions afforded
