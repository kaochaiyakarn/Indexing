argue real world setting needs powerful mechanism 
particular mechanism allow mapping concept ontology view query ontologies acquires relevant information navigating aggregating concepts 
research done data integration distinguish basic approaches defining mapping global centric approach concepts global ontology mapped queries local ontologies local centric approach concepts local ontologies mapped queries global ontology discuss approaches sections 
term concept denoting concept ontology 
global centric approach global centric approach aka global view approach assume query language vs alphabet mapping global local ontologies associating term global ontology view query local ontologies 
intended meaning associating term query vs query represents best way characterize instances concepts mechanism specify correspondence associated view sound complete exact 
local model global interpretation satisfies correspondence vs sound mg wrt tuples satisfying vs satisfy satisfies correspondence vs complete mg wrt tuple satisfying vs satisfies satisfies correspondence vs exact mg wrt set tuples satisfy exactly set tuples satisfying vs say satisfies mapping mg wrt satisfies correspondence mg wrt global centric approach adopted data integration systems 
systems sources databases general relational ones global ontology database schema represented relational form mapping specified associating relation global schema relational query source relations 
common opinion mechanism allow simple query processing strategy basically reduces unfolding query definition specified mapping translate query terms accesses sources :10.1.1.127.3070
add constraints simple form global schema query processing harder shown case study 
case study set global centric framework ontology integration ideas developed data integration global schemas expressed entity relationship model 
particular describe main components ontology integration system provide semantics system query answering 
ois mg defined follows global ontology expressed entity relationship model equivalently uml class diagrams 
particular may include typing constraints relationships assigning entity component relationship mandatory participation relationships saying instance entity participate th component relationship isa relations entities relationships typing constraints functional restrictions mandatory existence attributes entities relationships 
local ontologies constituted simply relational alphabet extensions relations 
example extensions may expressed relational databases 
observe assuming intensional relation terms local ontologies 
mapping mg set correspondences form vs sound concept entity relationship attribute global ontology vs query precisely mapping associates query arity entity mapping associates query arity entity attribute intuitively query retrieves pair extension local ontologies means value attribute entity instance argument query corresponds instances entity defined second argument corresponds values attribute mapping associates query arity relationship arity intuitively query retrieves tuple 
xn extension local ontologies means 
xn instance mapping associates query arity attribute relationship arity arguments query correspond tuples argument corresponds values specified intended meaning query vs associated concept specifies retrieve data corresponding global schema starting data sources 
confirms views approach concept global ontology defined view concepts local ontologies 
pose constraint language express queries mapping 
extensions local ontologies relational databases simply assume language able express computations relational databases 
specify semantics data integration system characterize set tuples extension various relations local ontologies data satisfying global ontology 
principle single extension model global ontology 
case data integration systems described literature 
show surprising result due presence semantic conditions implicit conceptual schema general account set possible extensions 
example 
shows global schema data integration system age functional attribute student mandatory participation relationship enrolled enrolled isa member university isa organization 
schema models persons members organizations students person member student enrolled age organization university global ontology example enrolled universities 
suppose constituted mapping follows person organization member student age university enrolled semantics ois easy see local model situations possible 
global model exists 
happens particular data extension local ontologies retrieved queries associated elements global ontology satisfy functional attribute constraints 

global models exist 
happens example data extension local ontologies retrieved queries associated global concepts satisfy isa relationships global ontology 
case may happen ways exist add suitable objects elements order satisfy constraints 
ways yields global model 
example 
referring example consider local model contains tuple contains tuple query associated age mapping specifies model tuples belong extension age 
age functional attribute follows model exists ois 
example 
referring example consider local model contains contains contains contains pairs join 
mapping follows model person member organization student university 
specifies student mandatory participation relationship enrolled model enrolled certain university 
key point said university accept models interpretations differ university enrolled 
framework proposed assumed problem solved queries extracting data extension local ontologies 
words assumed functional attribute corresponding query implements suitable data cleaning strategy see ensures local model tuple extension similar condition holds functional attributes relationships 
second problem shows issue query answering incomplete information arises global view approach data integration 
existence multiple global models ois implies query processing simply reduce evaluating query single relational database 
principle take possible global models account answering query 
interesting observe different strategies simplify setting overcome problem frequently adopted data integration systems data integration systems usually adopt simpler data model plain relational data model expressing global schema global ontology :10.1.1.127.3070
case data retrieved sources local ontologies trivially fits schema directly considered unique database processed query answering 
queries associated concepts global schema considered exact 
case analogously previous easy see global extension considered formed data retrieved extension local ontologies 
observe data extension obey semantic conditions implicit global ontology single extension coherent global ontology ois inconsistent 
implies query answering meaningless 
argue usual case autonomous heterogeneous local ontologies data fit global ontology approach restrictive sense ois inconsistent 
fact problem incomplete information overlooked current approaches explained observing traditional data integration systems follow mentioned simplifying strategies express global schema set plain relations consider sources exact see instance 
algorithm computing set certain answers queries posed data integration system 
key feature algorithm reason query global ontology order infer tuples satisfy query models ois 
algorithm simply unfold query basis mapping usually done data integration systems global view approach 
algorithm able add answers directly extracted local ontologies exploiting semantic conditions expressed conceptual global schema 
mg ois local model query global ontology algorithm constituted major steps 

query obtain new query expand elements global ontology knowledge relevant compiled 

expand compute query unfold mg expand unfolding expand basis mapping mg unfolding simply substitutes atom expand query associated mg element atom 
resulting unfold mg expand query relations local ontologies 

evaluate query unfold mg expand local model steps quite obvious 
requires find way compile query semantic relations holding concepts global schema way shown 
query expand returned algorithm exponential wrt expand union conjunctive queries queries mapping polynomial entire algorithm polynomial data complexity

major challenge approach order answer query expressed global schema able reformulate query terms queries sources 
global centric approach reformulation guided correspondences mapping problem requires reasoning step infer sources answering query
