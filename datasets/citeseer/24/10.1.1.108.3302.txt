constraints preferences ubiquitous real life 
preferences kinds qualitative quantitative conditional positive negative name 
ultimate goal define study formalisms model problems constraints kind preferences possibly defined agents develop tools solve problems efficiently 
briefly report goal 
motivation main goal 
preferences ubiquitous real life 
fact problems constrained solvable insist requirements strictly met 
solvable problems solutions different desirability 
problems naturally described preferences hard statements 
cases natural express preferences quantitative terms situations better qualitative statements 
preferences unconditional conditional 
furthermore real life problems constraints preferences various kinds may coexist 
unfortunately single formalism allows different kinds preferences specified efficiently reasoned effectively 
example soft constraints suited reasoning constraints quantitative preferences cp nets suited representing qualitative possibly conditional preferences 
ultimate goal define study formalisms model problems constraints kind preferences develop tools solve problems efficiently 
want able deal scenarios preferences expressed agents preference aggregation needed find optimal outcomes 
preference modelling frameworks soft constraints cp nets 
soft constraints model quantitative preferences generalizing traditional formalism hard constraints 
soft constraint assignment variables constraint annotated level desirability desirability complete assignment computed combination operator applied local preference values 
choosing specific combination operator ordered set levels desirability select specific class soft constraints 
set soft constraints ordering induced assignments variables problem partial total 
solutions checking preferable easy compute desirability values solutions compare preference order 
finding optimal solution soft constraint problem combinatorially difficult problem 
cp nets conditional preference networks graphical model compactly representing conditional qualitative preference relations 
exploit conditional preferential independence structuring user possibly complex preference ordering ceteris paribus assumption 
cp nets sets conditional ceteris paribus preference statements cp statements 
instance statement prefer red wine white wine meat served asserts meals differ kind wine served containing meat meal red wine preferable meal white wine 
cp net ordering induced set assignments features 
general ordering preorder reflexive transitive 
acyclic cp net finding optimal assignment features done linear time 
cyclic cp nets np hard 
comparing outcomes np hard cp net acyclic 
summarizing cp nets soft constraints complementary advantages drawbacks 
cp nets allow represent conditional qualitative preferences dominance testing expensive 
hand soft constraints allow represent hard constraints quantitative preferences cheap dominance testing 
comparing expressive power different formalisms 
useful single formalism representing preferences features soft constraints cp nets 
achieve goal may start comparing expressive power 
say formalism expressive formalism problem expressed possible build polynomial time problem expressed optimal solutions 
definition compare cp nets soft constraints see hard constraints expressive cp nets 
fact cp net obtain polynomial time set hard constraints solutions optimal outcomes cp net 
contrary hard constraint problems possible find polynomial time cp net set 
maintain set rest ordering solutions cp nets soft hard constraints incomparable 
possible approximate cp net ordering soft constraints achieving tractability dominance testing sacrificing precision degree 
different approximations characterized original ordering preserve time complexity generating approximation time complexity comparing outcomes approximation 
constraints preferences 
problems constraints qualitative quantitative preferences 
unfortunately reasoning difficult preferred outcome feasible feasible outcomes equally preferred 
example consider constrained cp net cp net plus set hard constraints 
structure allows model qualitative conditional preferences hard constraints 
optimal outcomes called feasible pareto outcomes feasible dominated cp net feasible outcome 
possible obtain optimal outcomes just solving set hard constraints 
defined cases avoids expensive dominance testing 
want avoid dominance testing completely price obtaining superset feasible pareto hard constraint solving 
constraint procedure add soft constraints cp net 
learning preferences 
usually hard user describe correct preferences real life problem 
especially true soft constraints intuitive graphical representation 
shown learning techniques greatly help respect allowing users state preferences entire solutions subsets variables 
preferences uncertainty 
preferences way describe kind uncertainty 
uncertainty comes lack data events nature control 
fortunately presence preferences uncertainty context temporal constraints reason complexity just preferences 
approaches deal uncertainty possibility theory 
handling coexistence preferences uncertainty possibility theory allows natural merging notions leads promising semantics ordering solutions preference uncertainty 
preference aggregation fairness non 
situations need represent reason simultaneous preferences agents 
aggregate agents preferences general express partial order possible outcomes query agent turn collect results 
see agent voting outcome dominates 
obtain different semantics collecting votes different ways 
having cast preference aggregation semantics terms voting appropriate ask classical results voting theory apply 
example arrow theorem states impossibility fair voting system 
fairly combine preferences individual agents 
definition fairness considered arrow consists desirable properties unanimity agents agree preferable resulting order agree 
independence irrelevant alternatives ordering result depends relation agents 
monotonicity agent moves position outcome ordering equal outcome move result 
absence dictator dictator agent matter say dictate resulting ordering outcomes 
certain conditions impossible preference aggregation system partially ordered preferences fair 
disappointing little surprising 
moving total orders partial orders expect enrich greatly ability combine preferences fairly 
fact resolve conflict contradict agents 
conditions identified escape reach arrow theorem 
interested preferred outcomes aggregated preferences impossible fair 
course fairness just desirable properties preference aggregations 
interesting properties related non preference aggregation system agent vote reach goal system manipulable 
results totally ordered preferences show non implies existence dictator 
unfortunately continues hold partially ordered preferences 

done achieve desired goal single formalism model problems constraints preferences kinds solve efficiently 
example currently considering extensions soft constraint formalism model positive negative preferences 
studying relationship optimal solutions preference formalisms nash equilibria game theory 
plan study notion privacy context multi agent preference aggregation
