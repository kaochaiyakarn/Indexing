experimentation experiments carried john university university period approximately eighteen months 
experiments yielded useful information program auralisation 
earlier tests indicated auralisation communicating information programmers 
comments received experiments showed subjects generally receptive idea program auralisation believed 
useful information regarding selection timbre complexity melodic structures intuitiveness mappings gleaned tests 
noted point experiments required identification solely basis aural cues 
real debugging situation programmers obviously detailed knowledge program

watkins dyson assert perceptual organisation tone sequences facilitated structured approximate schemata melodies belonging musical idiom listeners familiar 
western musical forms note diatonic scale readily recognised world especially computing community gives starting point auralisation design 
watkins dyson go say tone sequences obey constraints imposed system western scales keys easily organised cognitively learned discriminated control sequences comparable complexity

transition probabilities observed certain pitch combinations occur western music
