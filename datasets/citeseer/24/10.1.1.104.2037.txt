goal introduce simple models serve alternatives clearly unrealistic shortest path model 
model fully faithful reality key understand ways true representation ways diverges 
lines include development models explicitly incorporate additional characteristics clustering coefficient 
involve studying certain variants models hybrid random deviation node degree approaches real routes 
keep mind desirability keeping models conceptually simple easy implement computationally tractable 
shown routes simulated measured graph interface level 
chosen undirected variant skitter graph undirected graphs readily available simulation purposes 
introduced simplifying assumption node source destination 
graphs contain direction information label hosts separately routers potentially improve quality models 
models potentially synthetic graphs meant represent internet topology 
area extended capture dynamics internet routes 
effectively random choices random deviation model clearly node degree model comes choosing neighbors highest degree choosing shortest path trees
