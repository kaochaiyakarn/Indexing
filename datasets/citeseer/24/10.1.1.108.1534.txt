believe customer needs trust service provider willing enter business relationship 
proposed solution draws existing industry practice rigorous auditing process 
describing offering services business language easier compare service functionality especially non technical users 
comparability enables customers shop best offers similar services 
service consumer desire technical understanding set requirements technical performance service requirements expressed technical terminology 
provider may impose extra conditions 
provider give flexibility cost provide service
