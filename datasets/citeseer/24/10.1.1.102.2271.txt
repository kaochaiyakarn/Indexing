rest section discuss merging step fast exploiting cracker index 
shuffling cracker column observation

means cracker piece shifted positions cracker column follows 
assume holds tuples 
obviously better moving completely tuples 
case take tuples move way avoid moving tuples move tuples 
call technique shuffling 
example shuffling tuples moved position 
shuffling need move tuples 
go example time shuffling see

mci 
algorithm called merge completely insertions 
query requests value pending insertions column merged completely pending insertions placed cracker column 
disadvantage mci punishes single query task merge currently pending insertions query needs touch pending insertions new tuples arrived

updates simple way handle updates translate deletions insertions deletions need applied respective insertions order guarantee correct semantics 
algorithms apply pending deletions insertions merge cracker column purely attribute values correct order deletions insertions tuples guaranteed simply considering pending deletions pending insertions update aware cracker select operator 
fact problems occur updates mixture insertions deletions 
consider cases 
inserted tuple deleted insertion applied cracker column inserted tuple re added pending insertions column mri 
case tuple identical key value appear pending insertions pending deletions column 
query requests attribute value tuple needs merged cracker column 
applying pending delete change cracker column tuple 
applying pending insert add tuple cracker column resulting incorrect state 
simply avoid problem ensuring deleted tuple appended pending deletions column tuple pending insertions column 
tuple removed pending insertions column 
deletion effectively correctly cancels applied insertion 
situation occurs inserted updated tuple gets updated insertion original update applied 
having deletions cancel pending insertions tuple value solved problem 
similar situation occurs mri re adds zombie tuples pending deletion applied pending insertions column 
removal deleted tuple cracker column implicitly applies pending deletion 
respective tuple re added pending insertions column removed pending deletions column 
summary guarantee correct handling interleaved insertions deletions updates translated deletions insertions ensuring tuple added pending insertions deletions tuples identical key value exist pending deletions insertions column 
case exist needs removed 
scheme efficiently support updates cracked database loss desired cracking properties speed
