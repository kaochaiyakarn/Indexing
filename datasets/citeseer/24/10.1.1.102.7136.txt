emerging web standards promise network heterogeneous interoperable web services 
web services greatly simplify development kinds data integration systems information agents knowledge management applications 
unfortunately vision requires services provide substantial quantities explicit semantic metadata glue 
step automatically generating metadata algorithm learns attach semantic labels web forms evaluate approach large collection real web data 
key idea cast web form classification bayesian learning inference generative model web form design process 
emerging web standards uddi uddi org soap org tr soap wsdl org tr wsdl daml www daml org services promise ocean web services networked components invoked remotely standard xml protocols 
example major commerce companies amazon google export web services provide direct access content databases 
key automatically invoking composing web services associate machine understandable semantic metadata service 
details scope various web standards involve metadata various levels abstraction high level advertisements facilitate discovering relevant services low level input output specifications particular operations 
central challenge web services initiative lack tools generate necessary metadata semi automatically 
explore machine learning techniques automatically create metadata training data 
approach complements existing uses machine learning facilitate semantic web information extraction mapping heterogeneous data schemata

information agent invokes forms automatically discover fields labelled title completely different semantic interpretations 
domain service intended semantic meaning input 
example invoke web service queries airline timetable service annotated metadata indicating operation relate airline timetable querying parameter annotated kind data supplied departure data time airport destination airport return date number passengers 
precisely focus problem automatically classifying web service taxonomy service domains labelling service input parameters nodes taxonomy datatypes 
significant impediment research obtaining interesting collection real web services promised ocean just small today 
consequently focus restricted widely available alternative html forms available web pages 
example consider forms fig 

suppose web form classifier trained kinds forms forms finding book finding job 
want classifier assign class 
simple approach traditional text classification algorithms bag words harvested form html 
enable interoperability form classifier label individual fields forms task simple bag terms performs poorly 
note title field ambiguous case refers book title job title 
classifying field independently algorithm exploits evidence fields simultaneously 
example fig 
algorithm reason follows author isbn terms adjacent fields provide strong bottom evidence form relates finding book tentative classification provides top evidence title field relates book titles job titles 
casting web form classification problem bayesian terms leverage bidirectional reasoning ity inference algorithms developed bayesian network community 
goal learn metadata web services standards believe focusing html forms valuable intermediate step 
existing information agents harvest web content html forms 
second web services standards gain traction increasing need tools migrate legacy html interfaces web services standards 
importantly technologies need machine understandable semantic metadata 
example html form contain fragment isbn input name isbn br title input name wsdl description inputs web service message name part name title type string part name isbn type string message html wsdl unambiguous identifiers textual clues bound directly relevant fields 
deeper semantic challenge remains service invoked automatically additional metadata form field expects book isbn number second expects book title isbn number book title defined global taxonomy ontology 
example automatic agent know input corresponds parameter part name type string service 
standard web services answer semantic challenge hand crafted higher level metadata daml statements 
relationship emerging web standards seek algorithm generates daml statements wsdl descriptions 
suggested algorithm uses evidence available form html representation 
particular ignore additional sources evidence samples input data passed service output data returned service 
evidence may beneficial ignore satisfy important constraint permit processing client side 
related approaches permit algorithm invoke form learning semantics :10.1.1.14.8022
client side constraint important reasons 
want avoid overloading server sample queries learning 
second queries may dangerous side effects modifying database 
generating queries requires supply sample data values field just swapping difficult learning task 
primary goal automatically creating web services metadata techniques relevant applications
