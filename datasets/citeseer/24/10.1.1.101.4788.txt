ontologies fundamental data structure conceptualizing knowledge generally able build different ontologies conceptualizing body knowledge able say best suits predefined criterion 
ontology evaluation important issue addressed ontologies widely adopted semantic web semantics aware applications 
users facing multitude ontologies need way assessing deciding best fits requirements best

classification ontology evaluation approaches various approaches evaluation ontologies considered literature depending kind ontologies evaluated purpose 
broadly speaking evaluation approaches fall categories comparing ontology golden standard may ontology maedche staab ontology application evaluating results porzel involving comparisons source data collection documents domain covered ontology brewster evaluation done humans try assess ontology meets set predefined criteria standards requirements 
lozano mez rez 
addition categories evaluation group ontology evaluation approaches level evaluation described 
ontology fairly complex structure practical focus evaluation different levels ontology separately trying directly evaluate ontology 
particularly true want predominantly automated evaluation entirely carried human users experts 
reason level approach automatic learning techniques construction ontology techniques involved substantially different different levels 
individual levels defined variously different authors various definitions tend broadly similar usually involve levels lexical vocabulary data layer 
focus concepts instances facts included ontology vocabulary represent identify concepts 
evaluation level tends involve comparisons various sources data concerning problem domain domain specific text corpora techniques string similarity measures edit distance 
hierarchy taxonomy 
ontology typically includes hierarchical relation concepts 
various relations concepts may defined relationship particularly important may focus specific evaluation efforts 
semantic relations 
ontology may contain relations relations may evaluated separately 
typically includes measures precision recall 
context application level 
ontology may part larger collection ontologies may referenced various definitions ontologies 
case may important take context account evaluating 
form context application ontology evaluation looks results application affected ontology 
syntactic level 
evaluation level may particular interest ontologies constructed manually 
ontology usually described particular formal language match syntactic requirements language 
various syntactic considerations presence natural language documentation avoiding loops definitions may considered mez rez 
structure architecture design 
primarily interest manually constructed ontologies 
want ontology meet certain pre defined design principles criteria structural concerns involve organization ontology suitability development mez rez

way achieve tolerant matching criteria allowing synonyms augment lexical entry hypernyms wordnet similar resource brewster testing equality lexical entries test overlap corresponding sets words set containing entry hypernyms 
approaches evaluate lexical content ontology levels strings identify relations instances velardi 
describe approach evaluation ontology learning system takes body natural language text tries extract relevant domain specific concepts terms phrases find definitions web searches wordnet entries connect concepts relations 
part evaluation approach generate natural language glosses multiple word terms 
glosses evaluated domain experts familiar formal languages ontologies commonly described 
evaluation taxonomic semantic relations brewster 
suggested data driven approach evaluate degree structural fit ontology corpus documents 
corpus documents domain interest clustering algorithm em determine unsupervised way probabilistic mixture model hidden topics document modeled having generated mixture topics 
concept ontology represented set terms including name ontology hypernyms name taken wordnet 
probabilistic models obtained clustering measure topic identified clustering algorithm concept fits topic 
point require concept fits topic reasonably obtain technique lexical level evaluation ontology 
alternatively may require concepts associated topic closely related ontology possibly relations 
indicate structure ontology reasonably aligned hidden structure topics domain specific corpus documents 
drawback method approach evaluating relations difficult take directionality relations account may know concepts related really infer completely different relation 
golden standard evaluation ontology relational level precision recall measures comparing ontology golden standard list statistically relevant terms 
evaluate approach automatically extracting set triples form term role term naturallanguage text 
unfortunately preparing golden standard requires lot manual human 
somewhat different aspect ontology evaluation discussed guarino welty 
point philosophical notions rigidity unity better understand nature various kinds semantic relationships commonly appear ontologies discover possible problematic decisions structure ontology example express meta level characteristics class part indicate term may multiple meanings 
downside approach requires manual intervention trained human expert familiar mentioned notions rigidity expert annotate concepts ontology appropriate metadata tags checks certain kinds errors automatically 
maedche staab propose measures comparing relational aspects ontologies 
way drawback method important positive aspect golden standard defined comparison ontologies proceed entirely automatically 
semantic term hierarchy set super sub concepts 
hierarchies term represent concept concept 
compute set terms represent concepts set terms representing concepts overlap sets measure similar role term hierarchies 
average may computed terms occurring hierarchies measure similarity 
similar ideas compare relations 
context level evaluation ontology part larger collection ontologies may ontology may class concept declared ontology example web institutional library ontologies 
context evaluation ontology various ways 
example swoogle search engine ding 
uses cross semantic web documents define graph compute score ontology manner analogous pagerank google web search engine 
similar approach portal patel 

links ontologies treated 
example ontology defines subclass class ontology considered important ontology uses class domain range relation 
alternatively context evaluation may provided human experts example proposes ontology enhanced metadata design policy peer reviews provided users ontology 
suitable search engine perform queries metadata aid user deciding ontologies repository 
application evaluation typically ontology kind application task 
outputs application performance task better worse depending partly ontology 
argue ontology helps application question produce results task 
ontologies may evaluated simply plugging application evaluating results application 
elegant sense output application relatively straightforward non problematic evaluation approach exists 
example porzel describe scenario ontology relations primarily determine closely related meaning concepts task speech recognition problem evaluation final output task relatively straightforward proposed interpretations sentences compared gold standard provided humans 
application approach ontology evaluation drawbacks see ontology bad particular way particular task difficult generalize observation ontology small component application effect outcome may relatively small indirect comparing different ontologies possible plugged application 
data driven evaluation ontology may evaluated comparing existing data usually collection textual documents problem domain ontology refers 
example patel 
show determine ontology refers particular topic classify ontology directory topics extracts textual data ontology names concepts relations uses input text classification model trained standard machine learning algorithms 
similarly brewster 
extracted set relevant domain specific terms corpus documents latent semantic analysis 
amount overlap domain specific terms terms appearing ontology names concepts measure fit ontology corpus 
case extensive ontologies incorporating lot factual information cyc see www cyc com documents source facts external world evaluation examines facts derived ontology 
multiple criteria approaches family approaches ontology evaluation deals problem selecting ontology small short list promising ontologies set ontologies treats problem essentially decisionmaking problem 
help evaluate ontologies approaches defining decision criteria attributes criterion ontology evaluated numerical score
