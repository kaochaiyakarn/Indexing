study described set gain insight computer systems help people organise images designed 
firstly inspiration earlier management personal documents interviewed people ways currently organise physical photograph collections 
secondly attempt establish information retrieval techniques application area asked interviewees opinions number possible features computer system organising retrieving personal photographs 
motivation digital cameras cheaper capable producing high quality images widespread meaning people build large personal collections photographs electronic form 
computerbased systems store photographs facilitating browsing retrieval required 
existing research computer image management concentrated problem objectively indexing images visual properties manual classification annotation 
resulting systems reflect tend demonstrated collections stock photographs 
expected user little knowledge content collection typical task specifying query characterise images satisfying requirement 
indexing scheme process created automatically user 
expect tasks associated personal photograph collection somewhat different 
user system photographer know pictures memories associated 
may developed personal classification system

st bcs irsg colloquium ir glasgow methodology people organise photographs 
malone study highly qualitative form detailed interviews small number subjects 
study aim gain initial insights relatively unexplored area similar model adopted 
hoped results provide useful basis comprehensive claim subjects representative sample population 
twelve people asked set questions structured interview 
interviewees men women ranging age average 
background computer science regarded familiar pcs 
estimated size personal collections ranged photographs average 
practice part interview subjects asked collection personal photographs organised photographs go task searching particular photographs 
organisation malone study personal documents desks generally organised main units files explicitly titled units elements intentionally arranged systematic order 
files arranged groups 
piles contain elements intentionally arranged order may may title 
groups piles generally titled arranged pile spatial location important factor finding 
interesting apply observation personal photographs 
subjects conscious attempt file photographs usually photo albums people done photos 
includes subjects primarily slide film system involving numbering labelling slide boxes 
started numbering slides maintaining database short description order remind slides having browse 
subjects primarily mm negative film convert advanced photo system meaning majority photographs prints may organised albums 
subject commented having different sized pictures organisation difficult photo albums hold particular single size print 
files photographs classified individual events holidays 
convenient single event usually correspond file 
similar events tend recur series holidays country series hill walking trips thematic organisation may 
observed collections interviewees 
subjects asked write pictures 
people said occasionally write notes back photographs reminder benefit people inherit pictures 
write broad title file remind group pictures contains 
file photographs usually kept rough chronological order small adjustments arrangement meaningful aesthetic 
interviewees said file photographs separating bad ones part process 
bad photographs defined technically poor catching person pose just boring 
subjects said throw away bad photographs regarding useless space consuming clutter 
said bring throw away 
subject said gives bad photographs short time limbo case initial judgement harsh 
bad photographs discarded usually kept packets returned processing

packets may photographic equivalents document piles appear people main repository photographs cases owners intend file haven time 
subject said lazy filing photographs usually move best ones front packet top pile easier find 
malone number reasons keeping document pile 
may serve reminder just easily accessible 
main reasons feeling filing worth cognitive effort involved fitting documents existing classification scheme creating new 
may reason attempts filing personal photographs half really essential 
just keeping piles related vague order simple browsing fairly painless 
slides difficult browse prints interesting note slide photographers study investment filing 
subjects photographs digital form keep conventional directory structure index file containing description photograph 
subjects currently regular digital camera tried 
general awareness main advantage film needed cheap photographs viewed evaluated immediately taken 
images immediately loaded photograph editing software need scanning 
people gone digital cameras expensive low image resolution compared chemical film 
interviewees said want prints photographs start digital camera high quality printing cheap 
uses people photographs record events lives events recording 
favourite photographs may displayed home pasted year 
showing photographs friends common usually describing events captured example holiday 
subjects chosen making photographs available world wide web page imagine computer image management system provide facilities support 
interviewees said frequency look pictures tends decrease time taken photographs kept handy short period put away rest collection 
people take lot slides create slide shows friends 
show usually focus particular event corresponding boxes slides 
diverse slide show rare involve selecting slides number different boxes having replace 
subjects said take photographs artistic reasons photographs basis drawings paintings making send friends 
searching interviewees said searching collection just browsing usually looking particular photograph remembered 
idea location remembering rough position time taken guideline dip collection move backwards forwards 
factors physical appearance location file pile may act cues 
photograph expected place lent filed away 
difficulties photograph may number different files piles example visit holiday destination 
contrast searches workers stock photo agency example normally general requirement mind specific photograph 
aim usually retrieve number pictures satisfying client brief allowing client choose 
kinds search extensively studied enser 
searchers developed familiarity collection st bcs irsg colloquium ir glasgow people organise photographs 
organisation case systems allow people carry general image searches line 
interviewees difficulty thinking occasions searched collection way 
usually general requirement related presence particular person picture perceived quality 
subject remembered time wanted find pictures friends didn real memory particular photographs appeared lot sequential searching collection points time remembered taken pictures 
said invited evening bring box best photographs 
went task trying remember photographs particularly pleased searching sequentially scanning entire collection 
possibilities subjects asked open imagine organising photographs aid computer

example stock photo agencies classify pictures large number categories metadata conventional database system retrieve appropriate photographs response structured query 
course classification process carried manually time consuming highly experienced indexer unable anticipate potential uses particular photograph may put 
st bcs irsg colloquium ir glasgow people organise photographs 
manual annotation reliable way index images semantic content 
people encouraged enter notes photographs automatically indexed subsequent searching 
interviewees said awareness existence facility enter notes notes detailed normal 
picture may number different types annotation title keywords free text notes 
interviewees different idea 
example want explicitly assign particular keywords images organising search scheme 
approach adopted system allows user create hierarchical structure keywords people places assign keywords number photographs simply pointing clicking mouse 
people definitely want enter free text notes picture 
describing actual content picture explain context events depicted 
constructing slide shows extra notes added specific context show 
talking photographs natural typing notes 
possible perform speaker dependent speech recognition allow annotations indexed way free text notes enabling subsequent text search retrieval 
impossible recognise words correctly previous studies shown information retrieval effective despite recognition errors 
opinions divided possibility 
interviewees expressed enthusiasm saying imagine recording talking photographs notes part normal process browsing 
said feel self conscious speaking computer plan say sure appropriate context 
said wouldn trust computer correctly recognise speech 
subject said occasionally talk pictures certainly easier typing re carrying camera didn think bother retrospectively 
digital cameras offer audio recording feature 
searching possible system facility average rating mode searching photos date time taken searching photos text notes searching photos colours searching photos textures searching photos layout composition searching photos similar photos searching photos similar picture drawing choosing region regions photo asking photos regions similar specifying position selected region photo specifying relative positions selected regions text searching general concept searching date popular people different interpretations meant 
browsing collection chronological ordering far desirable entering database style query specific date 
subject said want find date photograph way 
flexible searching date welcome restriction query date range summer th july 
modern digital advanced photo system aps cameras record date time picture taken allow number ways searching date implemented 
searching text notes popular search features listed mentioned interviewees said facility write record detailed notes 
st bcs irsg colloquium ir glasgow content searching people organise photographs 
manual effort involved annotating images growing interest possibility automatically indexing images visual content 
large number content image retrieval systems ibm qbic developed years allowing user search image collection example image query 
system compares features example image colour texture layout images collection retrieves images regards similar 
example may collection may created user drawing tool 
studies actual usefulness content image retrieval systems real world tasks 
epic system spatial queries useful textual queries task involving selection stock images brochure 
clear content techniques useful storage retrieval personal photographs 
subjects stated turn content methods searching way example collection completely browsing difficult 
subject said thinking picture vague image looks problem translating computer 
easier browsing strategy locate remembered photograph 
subjects express definite interest content features 
described visual architecture student art student said colour texture layout searching photographs 
generally layout considered important colour texture perceived allow classes photographs identified wide angle views versus close ups group shots versus portraits 
people liked idea searching photographs similar example ratings varied widely 
people pointed similar images taken time better just look chronologically 
asked expect similarity defined people mentioned visual similarity combination colour composition areas colour expected semantic meaning landscapes christmas photos pictures people kissing 
expect sensible default similarity criteria built want able change set 
content retrieval systems query facility users create query image drawing universally unpopular perceived effort involved lack faith effectiveness 
current prototype image retrieval systems allow user select individual regions images query image 
example group bristol university created system index collection personal photographs group performed studies test useful people find region searching sort collection 
interviewees see benefit able specify regions example image particularly faces specifying region positions regarded specific detailed technical 
subjects said black white photographs collection usually taken artistic purposes 
presence black white pictures restrict effectiveness content image indexing technique relied colour proportion subjects keen photographers probably higher population 
browsing possible system facility average rating mode seeing photos folder reduced size rapidly scanning group photos video fast forward seeing large number photos similar photos clustered ability view number thumbnail images perceived useful browsing 
people stipulate thumbnails big get sense content interesting study big thumbnail needs people recognise image know understand st bcs irsg colloquium ir glasgow people organise photographs 
example image visualisations interviewees effect obvious black white 
content image know 
ability flip rapidly series full size photographs prove popular 
illustrated computer vision researchers stanford university possible automatically arrange thumbnail images visual content 
multi dimensional scaling produce visualisation large number thumbnail images containing similar colour distributions shown clustered 
part interview subjects examples shown 
interviewees interested idea sceptical idea searching images colour 
said easier way searching images colour trying translate vague requirement query 
interviewees agreed interesting see photographs arranged different way highlight visual connections wouldn noticed 
subjects see point grouping unrelated photographs visual similarity felt useful lay group related photographs assist creating aesthetically pleasing arrangement 
discussion implications system design simply having type information available digital form immediately aspects organising easier photographs exception 
example large collection longer take lot physical space 
trivial create multiple copies single photograph making easier give pictures friends create new sub collections disturbing main 
computer system managing photographs potentially offer benefits 
main concern information retrieval researchers systems help people find appropriate photographs require 
interviews people want look specific remembered photograph collection usually quite easy browse physical collection find 
easier find required photograph organised collection 
people see benefits organising photographs files effort st bcs irsg colloquium ir glasgow people organise photographs 
leave groups piles 
computer system help performing automatic classification 
digital photographs example usually time stamped easy provide chronological ordering 
important point basic way people attempt organise photographs provided free 
location data obtained gps group images world taken 
fulfil requirement general specific remembered image example pictures dad cat physical photograph collection potentially involve lot time consuming sequential browsing 
clear people carry sort search done easily 
computer system search criteria specified query images collection automatically matched 
query construction involves mental effort browsing worth effort browsing excessively time consuming 
may case large collection images especially organised classification scheme anticipated current need example contain pictures dad cat section 
general easier browse images textual documents image taken evaluated glance 
querying may important means searching images textual documents 
may particularly true case personal photographs people familiar images need look specific image 
interviewees expressed little interest constructing image queries specify purely visual criteria 
lot interest expressing requirements textually aid annotations 
people notes photographs worth effort 
prospect subsequent searching interviewees say provide annotations 
valuable searching systems aim support range different note styles suit preferences assigning keywords recording spoken comments 
queries textual annotations available image similarity metrics useful query example organising query results sort visualisation shown 
content image retrieval techniques may focused support browsing explicit querying 
part current involves evaluating usefulness kind visualisation image browsing tasks
