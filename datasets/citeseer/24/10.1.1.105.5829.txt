information providers may decide digitally sign published information 
information providers different levels knowledge different intentions different views world

information consumer decide claims wants trust specific task 
different tasks require different levels trust 
information consumers different trust policies order decide graphs treated trustworthy specific applications 
trust policies depend application area subjective preferences past experiences information consumer trust relevant information available 
naive information consumer example decide trust graphs explicitly asserted 
trust policy achieve high recall rate easily information providers publishing false information 
cautious consumer require graphs signed signers known web trust mechanism

trust policies different types information

trust architectures proposed semantic web far fall category :10.1.1.62.8205
general problem approaches require explicit domain specific trust ratings providing ratings keeping date puts unrealistically heavy burden information consumers

example policies approach believe information stated independent sources distrust product prices average price
