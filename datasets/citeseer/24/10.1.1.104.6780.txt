turtle architecture bring discussion formal level introduce system model 
turtle architecture consists large set nodes large set data items assume turtle node human user node owner subset di items interested obtaining 
user owning node willing share data items nodes owned people trusts denote friends subset fi 
assume friendship relation commutative nodes fj fi 
friendship transitive friend friend automatically friend 
data item attribute set ad associated 
attribute set consists number attribute value pairs describing certain properties data item evaluating user queries 
logical expressions consisting number attribute value pairs connected logical operators 
data item matches query attribute value pairs attribute set satisfy logical condition query expression 
user establishes cryptographically secure connection turtle node nodes friends subset 
central trust infrastructure shared secrets needed establish secure connections agreed means done common knowledge common past experiences owners friend turtle nodes assumed friends reallife 
established inter friends secure communication links exchanging data items propagating user queries 
users search new data items sending queries turtle network 
user starts introducing query expression query depth query interface turtle node 
node creates bit query id generating bit random number appending significant bits sha hash query expression treated ascii string 
way probability distinct queries query id extremely small 
query id node constructs query packet containing query expression query id hop count initially set query depth 
query packet broadcast friendship links desired query depth 
receiving query packet turtle node evaluates query expression attribute sets data items data subset 
matches node reports back node forwarded possibly originated query 
furthermore node decrements hop count query packet count positive packet forwarded node friends packet came 
see propagating query turtle network generates query broadcast tree rooted node originating query tree follows trust relationships turtle users 
query broadcast tree delivering query answers travel hop hop tree reach root 
order match queries answers node maintains query table queries forwarded query answer process completed 
query table entry corresponds query broadcast tree node part table entries indexed query id store address node parent tree time query received result section storing response packets node received children nodes tree 
query response packet consists address responder final bit query id response hop count possibly response payload consisting number data attribute sets 
final bit differentiating partial final answers 
node receiving positive answer query hit children query broadcast tree immediately report parent 
node indicates answers forward sending parent response packet final bit set 
happen circumstances node receives query packet query id matches query table call collision 
different nodes generate query id cause collision cycle friendship graph routed packet back 
node receives query packet zero hop count forwarding necessary 
node responds final packet includes attribute sets local data items matching query 
node received final answers children tree finished processing 
response packet final bit set zero partial answer 
rules apply partial answers node receiving query matching elements data set creates partial answer response hop set zero payload consisting attribute sets data items match query 
node receiving partial answer children tree changes responder address packet address increments response hop count forwards parent node 
node keeps copy original response packet received child response section query table needed data retrieval phase see shortly 
query completes originating node received final answers friends 
point originating node accumulated partial answer packets 
node sorts partial answers identify distinct data attribute sets user way results web search engine query ranked frequency hop distance 
user selects result interested node start data retrieval phase 
retrieval phase consists selecting retrieval path propagating query result path 
data element identified attribute set ad retrieval path shortest path query tree root node path determined hop hop starting root node searches response packets selects ad payload smallest response hop count 
root asks friend selected response packet received retrieve ad data item 
friend follows similar procedure find hop retrieval path retrieval request reaches node actual data item 
data item sent requester hop hop retrieval path reverse order discussion basic assumptions proposing turtle architecture 
assume continuous high speed internet connections ubiquitous near 
looking current trends show increasing dsl cable modem penetration consumer market mention wireless cover large parts big cities assumption reasonable 
second assumption sufficiently large social communities college campus country world friendship relationships form fully connected graphs 
validating assumption obviously involve large scale sociological experiments slow safe name turtle scope 
famous degree separation experiment moderate success pgp infrastructure explosive popularity service reasons believe relationships involving moderate amount trust achieve full friendship graph connectivity 
technical considerations expect main application scenario exchanging sensitive information involve small data items 
reason designed turtle packet routing overlay 
straightforward re design circuit switching network accommodate large data transfers 
significant change protocol concern retrieval path nodes establish virtual tunnel connecting source destination 
require dealing issues flow control buffering quality service 
second system performance greatly improved data items cached 
complemented gossip mechanisms allow nodes quickly disseminate information data items popular order implement smarter cache algorithms 
unique trust properties overlay nodes trust directly interact easy enhance turtle economic model encourage cooperation sharing 
example sending back response packet node include price tag supplying item node broadcast tree adding relay fee price tags received children 
query initiator final price tag additional selection criteria deciding data item request 
payments aggregated longer intervals having turtle nodes keeping track amount owed owed friend nodes 
node periodically report balance sheet owner settle matter friends band means cash exchange 
security implications security point view turtle architecture raises number interesting points turtle offers query query result anonymity initiator responder known respective friends subsets trusted nodes 
small modifications query result routing protocol removing hop counts possible achieve complete sender receiver anonymity 
information exchange done encrypted channels way adversary link query initiator responder traffic analysis 
known techniques protecting traffic analysis easily incorporated basic query result routing protocol :10.1.1.30.3785
second turtle network immune sybil attack :10.1.1.17.1073
powerful adversary able create large number malicious turtle nodes effect nodes correct functioning system minimal attacker able nodes friends sets correct nodes require lot social engineering 
third turtle exhibits desirable fail mode property confined damage meaning security break correct turtle node affects small subset correct nodes system case node plus friends subset 
due way turtle overlay organized denial service attacks typical peer peer network malicious routing content masquerading content match description bogus query hits node answering positive query matching content aborted transfers happen 
direct interactions take place nodes controlled people trust respect friends expect incentives random malicious behavior reduced 
ethical implications turtle allows private sharing data protects data providers data consumers intermediaries potential negative consequences stemming identified participants data exchange 
main motivation providing citizens living regimes safe private information sharing network 
clear technology activities dubious ethical value illegal sharing copyrighted digital products 
lot debate regarding legality morality sharing copyrighted information peer peer networks 
pointed benefits copyright laws brought society printing press age longer apply case digital content 
remains seen copyright laws changed adapt digital technology opinion widespread fast efficient file sharing networks kazaa gnutella traffic deals illegal sharing copyrighted material left unchecked eventually drastically reduce incentives artistic creativity 
turtle network activities drastic impact 
way turtle designed speed data retrieval dictated bandwidth capacity slowest link retrieval path 
turtle share large items considerably slower kazaa gnutella 
un ease combined fact moment data exchanged friends way legally pursue copyright involve morally strategies forcing people rat friends may help defining new legal framework constitutes acceptable sharing fair related turtle unique bottom way builds overlay starting pre existing trust relationships users 
best knowledge peer peer systems employ technique 
idea indirect routing requests results order achieve sender receiver anonymity time 
chaum suggested building mix network anonymous mail delivery 
crowds builds peer peer mix network anonymous web browsing :10.1.1.30.3785
idea employed building general purpose anonymizing network layers 
context peer peer data sharing networks indirect routing queries results employed freenet aim creating secure global information storage system :10.1.1.10.4919
freenet node acting relay forbidden exchange achieve limited degree plausible deniability 
relay node exposure combined lack priori trust relationships interacting nodes freenet hard sell network considerations apply anonymizing censorship resistant peer peer systems manages offer acceptable level protection entity request retrieval path :10.1.1.20.417:10.1.1.125.3017
described turtle peer peer architecture safe sharing sensitive information 
order achieve strong privacy guarantees turtle organizes data sharing overlay top pre existing user trust relationships 
protects privacy data senders receivers intermediate relay nodes facilitate data exchange 
furthermore turtle resistant denial service attacks plague existing peer peer data sharing networks 
directions mentioned possible extensions basic query protocol support retrieval large data items hop hop virtual circuits economic models encourage cooperation sharing 
interesting look ways associate sensitivity levels data items different trust levels different friends allow node owners specify complex security privacy policies regarding data items share
