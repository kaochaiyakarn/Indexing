ebay registered users posted new listings quarter 
presence influence auction houses acknowledged popular traditional retailers promote sell products 
online auctions sell commodities sold traditional retailers opportunity find bargain primary motivation favor online auctioning 
participating online auction requires buyers trust inherently adverse environment 
sellers register pseudonyms buyer risks participating transaction unknown seller trustworthy retailer 
second large scale online auction houses sellers advertise items buyer forced choose large set pseudonymous sellers 
studies shown pseudonymous sellers large scale policies auction house encourage users cheat 
legitimate bidder participating auction way determine bidders auction honest shill bidders collaborate seller artificially inflate final price 
tool establish trust buyers sellers electronic reputation system 
typically reputation system bi directional medium buyers post feedback sellers vice versa 
ebay buyers voluntarily comment quality service satisfaction item traded shipping 
sellers comment prompt payment buyers respond comments left buyers 
feedback reputation systems suffer drawbacks 
reliability feedback debatable studies shown bi directional reputation systems tend inflate positive feedback deflate negative feedback 
analysis ebay auctions shows ebay sellers reputations feedback positive 
second existing reputation systems help buyers avoid sellers auctions regularly appear price inflated 
systems account tactics legitimate fraudulent seller may ensure profitable sale 
buyer rationally choose seller advertise product 
propose reputation system addresses drawbacks 
system identifies sellers auctions appear 
determine cause price inflation determine price inflation legal competitive bidding fraudulent 
conjunction traditional system system helps buyers avoid sellers feedback auctions prices near items market values 
system robust biased feedback avoids voluntary feedback users

data collected actual ebay auctions automatically detected sellers hard disk seller behavior auctions ended winning bid average auctions posted hard disk sellers ended bids 
average number bids seller auctions abnormally high 
group bidders repeatedly participated lost auctions acting 
system determine behavior fraudulent merely competitive patterns discovered suggest buyer find bargain seller auctions 
final prices auctions comparable market value coupled shipping fees 
build system principles anomaly detection 
system assumptions sellers honest auctions artificially price inflated 
collect data auctions seller statistically compare seller data data sellers identify anomalous sellers 
designed statistical models identify price inflation consequently anomalies indicate sellers adopted questionable tactics auctions better avoided 
reputation system statistical models 
model correlates number auctions seller posts average number bids auctions 
inverse correlation number seller auctions increases average bid count decreases 
model identifies set anomalous sellers post auctions attract bidders 
assume auctions sellers inflated 
second model provides explanation terms legitimate behavior anomalous sellers identified model 
model correlates auction starting bid number bids auction 
auctions low starting bids receive bids auctions higher starting bids 
model separates anomalous sellers model sellers auctions attracts abnormally high number bids sets low starting bids high starting bids 
accept low starting bid legitimate explanation high number bids 
auctions bids low starting bids price inflated auctions bids high starting bids 
third model provides explanation anomalous cases identified model terms fraudulent behavior 
model identifies group bidders repeatedly participate seller auctions lose 
call group bidders potential behavior consistent shilling inflate prices people win 
third model strengthen belief seller prices inflated 
models identify anomalous sellers appear artificially raising bids auctions 
seller inflated prices seller model auctions attract bids ii second model start auctions relatively low starting bid iii third model group bidders repeatedly participate auctions lose 
addition classifying seller normal abnormal system provides score seller

threat analysis consider techniques malicious seller appear normal reputation system 
system uses anomaly detection identify sellers price inflated auctions possibly due shilling 
malicious seller may try lower reputation scores normal ranges models 
say seller attempts normalize reputation scores 
examine seller normalize score 
restrict case seller normalizes exactly scores cases seller attempts normalize score left 
normalizing score seller classified anomalous auctions attract bids auctions sellers selling product 
normalize score seller reduce number bids auctions 
consider ways malicious seller achieve goal fewer shill bids auction 
assumed malicious seller fraudulent shill bidders elevate prices auctions 
reduce average number bids malicious seller fewer shill bids auction 
note fewer shill bids eliminate shilling activity limits seller ability inflate prices 
malicious seller uses fewer shill bids auction defeat reputation system unable inflate prices desired 
creating new identity 
malicious seller create new identity starting empty profile system 
new identity reputation score including feedback reputation ebay seller attract fewer buyers shown research 
reduces average number bids seller auctions 
shill bids employed seller may increase average number bids normality line technique helps seller stay normal range losing feedback reputation translates lost profits 
malicious seller decide losing old identity feedback reputation poor reputation system starting afresh 
example serves demonstrate reputation system complement feedback reputation system 
adding shill bids auctions sellers 
classical poisoning attack attacker alters definition normal include behavior poisoning data anomaly detection system compute normality 
malicious seller alter model adding shill bids auctions sellers level expected win 
sufficient change average may malicious seller behavior appear normal 
shill bid level high sufficiently alter average number bids attacker place large number bids large number auctions 
attacker risks winning auctions particularly ebay auctions regularly bids malicious seller buyer bidding items 
poisoning attack certainly possible believe succeed high financial cost 
normalizing score classifies seller anomalous average number bids auctions higher average predicted minimum starting bids set seller 
normalize score malicious seller options try decrease average number bids auction techniques discussed section 
decrease minimum starting bids number bids auctions matches average predicted reducing minimum starting bid ensure classify seller normal 
demonstrates positive correlation minimum starting bid number bids auction lower minimum starting bid bids auction gets 
malicious seller lowers starting bids average number bids auctions increase correspondingly consequently seller remains anomalous 
may possible develop mathematical model helps malicious seller determine minimum starting bid keep score normal range 
model currently scope 
note reducing minimum starting bid option sellers start auctions low prices 
normalizing score seller classified abnormal respect seller cumulative bidder presence curve normal bidder presence curve mark gap cumulative bidder presence curve cumulative bidder wins curve statistically high

consider techniques seller may achieve goals 
distributing shill bids

distributing shill bids single bidder bidders reduces bidder presence 
cumulative bidder presence curve seller shifted normal bidder presence curve 
note distributing shill bids larger group bidders affect seller normalize metrics
