describe term extraction module document explorer system provide experimental evaluation performed set documents published reuters years 
traditional databases store information form structured records provide methods querying obtain records content satisfies user query 
researchers knowledge discovery databases kdd provided new family tools accessing information databases :10.1.1.18.1674
goal called data mining defined nontrivial extraction implicit previously unknown potentially useful information data 
area includes applying machinelearning statistical analysis techniques automatic discovery patterns databases providing user guided environments exploration data 
efforts kdd focused knowledge discovery structured databases despite tremendous amount online information appears collections unstructured text 
previous approaches text mining tags attached documents words contained documents :10.1.1.41.4883
standard text mining systems usually operate documents categorized documents documents manually automatically set examples tagged terms identifying content 
systems course extended full text document systematically tagging documents words contain 
process provide effectively exploitable results shown association generation :10.1.1.17.4827
example experiment just mentioned association generation process detected compounds domain dependent terms wall street treasury secretary james baker considered potentially useful associations extracted uninterpretable associations dollars shares exchange total commission stake securities considered easily understandable 
exploitation untagged full text documents requires additional linguistic pre processing allowing automated extraction documents linguistic elements complex simple words

taxonomy construction crucial issues performing text mining term level need term taxonomy 
term taxonomy enables production high level association rules similar general association rules 
rules capture relationships groups terms individual terms 
taxonomy important text mining algorithms maximal association rules frequent maximal sets 
taxonomy enables user specify mining tasks concise way 
instance trying generate association rules looking possible rules user specify interest relationships companies context business alliances 
order need nodes term taxonomy marked business alliances companies 
node contains terms related alliance joint venture strategic alliance combined initiative second node parent names system set rules knowledge extracted www directories generate names 
building term taxonomy time consuming task 
provide set tools semi automatic construction taxonomy 
main tool taxonomy editor 
tool enables user read set terms external taxonomy update system term taxonomy 
user drag entire subtrees taxonomies specify set terms regular expressions

previous approaches text mining tags attached documents words contained documents 
tags assigned manually line services dialog reuters expensive time consuming process machine learning algorithms 
text categorization algorithms provided training set pre tagged documents 
main drawbacks machine learning approach requires expert go tag hundreds training documents accuracy high 
break point algorithms 
tag approach characterized relatively small controlled vocabulary 
implications results mining operations 
hand tags meaningful organized taxonomy mining results high quality 
hand information documents captured tags lost mining process 
systems full texts documents tend produce huge number meaningless results 
example association generation process detected compounds domain dependent terms treasury secretary james baker extracted uninterpretable associations :10.1.1.17.4827
additional disadvantage full text documents execution time memory requirements mining algorithms 
term level text mining attempts benefit advantages extremes 
hand need human effort tagging document loose information document tagged documents approach 
system ability new collections preparation ability merge distinct collections tagged different guidelines prohibit merger tagged system 
hand number meaningless results execution time mining algorithms greatly reduced 
working term level enables construction help semi automatic tools hierarchical taxonomy extremely important text mining system 
currently working empirical evaluation term extraction process shall compare results obtained different methods set terms designated important human indexers
