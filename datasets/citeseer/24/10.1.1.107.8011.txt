theories give rise social reasoning mech anism proposed simulated sichman 
section explains main concepts underlying theory 
social powers dependence castelfranchi personal powers agents determined capabilities resources skills knowledge motivations allow satisfy goals 
powers satisfy goals agents rela tionships power dependence established 
dependence considered combination lack power agent corresponding personal powers 
social dependence agents occurs goal success goal depends action carry agent 
definition starting point complex dependence relationships interacting agents defined follows 
firstly mutual de situation agent infers agent socially depend goal common goal 
secondly recip dependence situation occurs agents socially depend different goals 
unilateral dependence situation agent infers socially depends agent goals agent socially depend goals 
castelfranchi explains dependence powers strategies ence agents identified 
example promise prize strategy agent induces adopt goal promise reward money welfare gifts 
strategy succeed prizes accordance goals agents influenced 
castelfranchi says threat sanctions occurs agent induces adopt goals order avoid punished 
case second agent know power im pose punishment 
contrast search cooperation strategy influence agents adopt goals pursuing goal mutual dependence 
fi nally agents reciprocal dependence reciprocation strategy 
case agents agrees adopt goal promise help words exchange goals agreed 
multiparty dependence social power theory states agent needs know dependence specific agent needs reason position society 
agents different situations 
agent may find agents help overcome dependence respect goals meaning choose agents satisfy goals 
situation leads agent socially dependent probability finding help increases probability achieving goal having give exchange 
contrary agents needed satisfy goals agent socially dependent 
agent frequently required help agents depend said great social utility 
situations known dependence respectively combination allows agent know value importance society 
negotiation power agents determines useful agent agents depend 
discussion social power theory sets basis explain forms social interactions occur

seen social power theory things offer 
social perspective norms social norms philosophical point view tuomela proposes general structure norms group agents 
social norm consists components class addressee agents group agents addressees belong task performed circumstances task carried 
tuomela classifies social norms kinds rules norms proper social norms norms 
tuomela rules represent explicit agreements agents created authority 
rules subdivided classes follows 
mal rules include legal sanctions laws regulations formal rules written form communicated include informal sanctions 
addition proper social norms norms accepted agreement mutual beliefs divided classes conventions con cern society social class social sanctions approval disapproval group specific norms concern group agents society 
tuomela explains conditions rules proper social norms ought fulfilled members group conditions cause norm force 
condition refers fact norms issued authority 
accessibility condition states members group acquire belief ought comply norm 
members group fulfill norm disposed said pervasiveness condi tion satisfied motivational condition met members fulfill norm believe true ought 
sanction condition refers existence social pressure members deviate norm 
rule acceptance condition conjunction accessibility conditions proper social norm accepted accessibility condition needed 
contrary rules norms need issued authority recognised norms members group 
tuomela argues norm social ought rule force group acceptance interpreted accessibility pervasiveness motivational sanction conditions satisfied 
addition norm proper social ought norm force group acceptance ity pervasiveness motivational sanction conditions satisfied 
norms norms tuomela recognises existence kinds norms social responsiveness represent 
instance moral norms norms shall steal normal circumstances norms norms ought maximize expected utility 
tuomela argues norm obeying means acting right normative reason 
norms obeyed represent law represent agreement due presence sanctions sanctions 
norms grounded agent beliefs fulfilled behaviour expected social sanctions sanctions may applied 
norms obeyed conscience demands norms rational 
case conflicts norms priorities considered 
general norms override norms overridden norms norms 
tuomela observes group lacks specific kind norm kinds norms arise 
lack norms force compensated creation norms enjoyment lawyers 
example norm commit fraud grounded belief group agents norm issued law norm compliance monitored penalised legally recognised authorities 
law norms ross distinguishes norms directive utterances directives just linguistic phenomena norms related social facts 
distinguishes norms conformity patterns behaviour norm violated social reaction follows 
reaction comes individuals acting spontaneously institutionalised organs society created purpose police courts executive authorities 
fundamental condition existence norms majority cases fulfilled members society 
addition ross argues norm binding feelings obligations agents feel position coercion norm complied 
fact compliance norms generally enforced threat punishment means reaction norm violated 
consequently norms specify punishments applied violates norm exist 
considerations ross considers norms directives commands re lated certain social facts 
argues norm describes patterns followed members society 
members turn feel bound norm violation penalised 
ross states norm includes elements subjects directive situations norm followed theme norm specifies subjects act specified conditions 
way norms represent obligations agents 
ross defines commands prohibitions obligations follows 
command norm creates obligation behave theme 
prohibition obligation behave accordance theme norm 
ross defines norms conduct humans terms obligations prohibitions follows 
person obligation person behave accordance theme norm entitled claim behave way 
words person entitled require comply norm 
similar terms permission person person means person claim person 
norms competence identified ross 
explain new valid norms may created performance legal acts 
competence relation people stating person obligation obey norms created correct manner 
words person endowed competence issue new norms specific field subject power obligation obey 
consequently person means competence second 
immunity relations defined norms person ignore person powers exerted disability occurs powers competence exerted 
discussion norms long mechanisms limit human autonomy way coexistence self interested people possible
