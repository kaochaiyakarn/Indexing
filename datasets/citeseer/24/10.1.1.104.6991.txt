modular tools stream input output speci job combined tools unix pipeline 
di erent combinations tools pipeline completing di erent tasks 
architecture imposes additional constraint input output streams common syntactic format 
common format chose extensible markup language xml

detailed comparison sgml oriented architecture traditional data base oriented architectures 
tool architecture piece software uses api access xml sgml data performs particular task exploiting markup previously added tools removing markup adding new markup stream destroying previously added markup 
approach allows remain entirely sgml paradigm corpus markup allowing general design tools purposes 
furthermore pipe data processes unix operating system provides natural glue integrating data level applications 
sgml handling api workbench lt nsl library handle complex document structures dtds 
allows tool read change add attribute values character data sgml elements address particular element xml stream query language called

queries contain wildcards

core tool muc system fsgmatch 
fsgmatch sgml transducer 
takes certain types sgml elements wraps larger sgml elements

fsgmatch called di erent resource grammars develop grammar recognising names organisations 
ltg tools possible fsgmatch targeted way telling process sgml elements certain sgml elements speci resource grammar purpose 
piping previous text fsgmatch resource grammar names result said director enamex type organization russian bear enamex combined functionality fsgmatch gives system designers degrees freedom 
suppose want map character strings th rd sgml entities 
character level specifying strings match st nd rd th wrapped sgml structure ord 
sgml level marked numbers num write rule fsgmatch saying num followed element character data consist th nd rd st wrapped ord element

annotated stream goes second tool pre trained maximum entropy model 
takes account contextual information named entities position sentence words exist lowercase lowercase document features passed model attributes partially matched words 
model provides positive answer partial match match wrapped corresponding enamex element
