text classification techniques assume manually labelled corpora handy training assumption quite realistic practical experience 
thing labelling corpus laborious needs assistance professional indexers possibly suffers problem subjectivity acquisition corpora non trivial matter 
techniques relying hand labelled corpora create thematic metadata ill suited cooperate web information services 
hand exists system automatically acquire necessary training corpora user defined topic hierarchies train classes effectively positively system easily adapted cooperate web information services 
give great facility human users 
consideration motivates design system named requires limited human involvement creating hierarchical text classifiers 
developed assumption exist manually assigned corpus exists amount inadequate 
consider web offers data source subjects system designed fully exploit richness web resources 
main features web search result pages corpus source exploiting structural information inherent topic hierarchy train classifier creating key terms amend insufficiency topic hierarchy 
sketch key idea briefly 
topic hierarchy intuitive idea acquire topic related corpora web substitutes corpora 
considering heterogeneity web corpus noises contained downloaded documents 
suitable tools realize idea web search engines 
may send names classes queries search engines returned search results pages corpus 
retrieved search results may contain noises unavoidably 
idea late precise queries organize corpus effectively concept classes 
main merits wide adaptability flexibility 
needed classifier created simply defining topic hierarchy

hcqf classifier generator hcqf acronym hier concept query formulation technique developed train statistical models topic classes

feature extractor decide similarity text object target class need representation model describe 
case full articles short documents directly content words feature source 
text object concern text segment user query named entity topic term problem slightly complicated 
case text object affords abundant feature terms contains tens thousands words case words composing text segment obviously insufficient 
overcome problem send text segment query search engines returned pages feature source 
note snippets source web pages reduce number page accesses

train classifiers section similar process repeated sending boolean expression class names search engines returned pages training corpus 
considering heterogenous nature web may doubt sound strategy web resources feature source

hcqf classifier generator sake clarity technique hier concept query formulation hcqf step step manner 
topic hierarchy consists parts set topic classes cn set relations rm relating hierarchically super classes conceptually subsume sub classes 
topic class name assigned keyword essentially represents concept concept usually embodied pre arranged training set describes characteristics 
ci disregarding relative position send name ci search engines returned snippets training set 
refer concept described training set general concept ci ci case think kind general concept concept ci really meant represent 
reason general concept fully reflect structural information inherent topic hierarchy remedy problem define specific concept ci think really concept ci represents context hierarchy 
idea illustrated example suppose department sub class university topic hierarchy expresses fails indicate department child class university 
concept really represents fact child put way suppose wish train class cs department subclass stanford snippets gotten query cs department positively contain information cs department possibly cs department universities stanford 
training set apparently isn precise description class wish train 
back example research specific concept result general concept constrained parent line reasoning ancestors exert influence general concept 
naturally led think converse 
descendant classes exert reciprocal influence ancestor classes descendant classes enrich concept ancestor classes give precise description 
suppose university departments concept represents fact parent descendent classes enrich concept summarize ci content specific concept determined combination factors ancestors general concept 
formally define specific concept class ancestors ac descendants dc specific concept union separate parts specific ancestral concept sa specific descendant concept sd general concept constrained ancestors unification specific concepts descendants sa ai ai ac sd sa dj dj dc sa sd 
task preparing training set express sa difficult fortunately real world search engines relieve trouble 
may send query boolean expression name ancestors ac search engines returned snippets required training set sa 
conversely preparing training set express sd simply adds training sets specific ancestral concept dc 
practical terms total training set class composed training set nmax snippets sa training sets nmax dc sd 
note nmax snippets converted class object vector space model discussed section 
array class objects sa sd 
strength hcqf lies exactly kind rich training set 
concept specified ancestors descendants 
suppose consider sa drop sd merely nmax snippets train ci hand take sd consideration may dramatic dc nmax snippets train 
note convert training sets class objects expression better restated comparison dc objects 
additional dc nmax snippets dc objects don contain noise expect constrained ancestors 
easily seen may train classes traversing manner bfs twice 
ci round collects training set sa ci second round adds training sets sd ci ci 
having collected necessary training sets collection terms training sets total feature vocabulary training sets converted class objects 
far idea hcqf observed mainly concerns formulate precise queries organize corpus 
left problems 
leaf class internal classes strengthened descendent classes 
words sd hcqf weaker descriptive power 
second suppose non hierarchical tree flat structure hcqf generalized applied 
answer questions lies fact find classes enrich leaf class inserting pseudo children classes 
leaf class collecting snippets organize sa easily find associated terms filtering mechanisms choose proper terms child classes set operations express idea meaning clear discussion 
strictly speaking notation mathematically rigorous 
concept isn composed distinct entities mathematical set necessary finds associated terms web retrieved snippets 
leaf class local training document set extract associated terms 
hcqf set topic classes relations topic classes srs collection training sets search result snippets initially collection feature vector class objects choose bfs send search engines leaf atc associated terms subsumption atc send search engines choose bfs descendents srs srs srs srs transform srs feature vector section transform srs return associated terms subsumption topic class training set set associated terms initially return associated terms occurrence topic class training set set associated terms initially df df df value gotten search engines return algorithmic procedure describing hcqf 
note line replaced associate term occurrence 
experiments employed techniques create pseudo child classes 
choose terms subsumed terms having highest mutual information technique assumption suppose term leaf subsumed documents leaf appears contain documents containing necessarily contain leaf formula set follows leaf leaf :10.1.1.44.3667:10.1.1.44.3667
