mobile devices may share resources presence untrustworthy devices 
device may computational model input reputation information produces trust assessments 
assessments device decides share sharing trustworthy devices isolating untrustworthy ones 
theoretical absence general distributed authentication mechanism 
currently distributed trust frameworks offer authentication mechanism supports user privacy whilst resistant sybil attacks 
fill gap analyze general attack space relates anonymous authentication applies distributed trust models 
put forward scheme blinded threshold signature collections devices certify pseudonyms seeing relying central authority 
discuss scheme tackles authentication attacks 
produce reliable assessments distributed trust frameworks able uniquely authenticate users 
see consider example 
cathy devices exchange recommendations shops local area 
exchange know authenticated device values cathy recommendations cathy reputation recommender past recommendations useful vice versa 
able easily generate new pseudonym cathy device produce fake recommendations traceable 
general trace past misbehavior users able easily change pseudonyms ideally user pseudonym 
hand protect privacy users anonymously authenticate authenticate revealing real identities 
example may wish buy boots 
uses mobile device collect useful recommendations trustworthy sources 
recommendation sharing service requires devices trust models turn require users authenticate 
device authenticate order ask recommendations subject boots sensitive device authenticates revealing identity anonymously 
existing research distributed reputation trust models offer general solution unique anonymous authentication relying central authority 
distributed trust models allow anonymous pseudonyms suffer sybil attacks 
tackle attacks centralized solutions approaches apply limited scenarios 
contribution lies firstly systematically analyzing general attack space relates anonymous authentication applies distributed trust models secondly proposing scheme decentralized general applied existing trust models 
specifically scheme meets appropriate security requirements supports desirable features 
security requirements include anonymity prevent privacy breaches ii non repudiation prevent false accusation iii unique identification avoid attacks caused disposable pseudonyms iv pseudonym revocation cope stolen pseudonyms 
desirable features include general applicability scheme general purpose reputation system benefits ii line authentication users relying iii distributed pseudonym issuing valid pseudonyms issued relying central authority

related course nearly years cooperation authentication begun diverge authentication relied central authorities cooperation migrated decentralized solutions 
authentication cooperative mechanisms started decentralized 
disposable pseudonyms facilitate anonymity hinder cooperation absence central authority 
see consider collection actors cooperating 
actor authenticates anonymous pseudonym disclose real identity remain anonymous 
actor may profit ease creating pseudonyms 
example actor may authenticate pseudonym misbehave create new pseudonym authenticate new pseudonym pretending new actor misbehave 
result actor misbehaves traceable 
resnick friedman formally laid problem presenting game theoretical model analyzing social cost allowing actors freely change identities 
concluded actors generate pseudonyms unknown actors regarded malicious 
avoid unknown actors proposed free lifetime pseudonyms central authority certifies blind signature 
couple years put similar ideas test networks 
discussed attacks resulting users multiple identities named sybil attacks 
concluded critical take decentralized au support absence trusted central identification authority sybil attacks undermine trust relationships cooperation 
time centralized solutions support authentication distributed trust models aiming promoting cooperation absence central authority whilst supporting users anonymity 
example eigentrust distributed trust model suffers sybil attacks absence central entity 
uses reputation decrease number downloads inauthentic files file sharing network 
network pseudonyms authenticate peers enabling peer anonymity time sybil attacks 
eigentrust partly tackles attacks assumes presence central entity get new identity user perform entry test read text jpeg send result central authority 
costly simple adversary create thousands users 
doubts central authentication solutions decentralized trust models surfaced 
secure project marks decentralized trust management model fully decentralized anonymity support 
project nielsen formal decentralized trust model jensen proposed context dependent pseudonyms user pseudonym depending context interaction 
approach suffers sybil attacks 
enhanced original trust model trust updates internalize costs sybil attacks 
solution applies specific representation trust values counts outcomes 
proposed general distributed privacy enhancing scheme trust establishment 
focuses making users recommendations anonymous untraceable 
propose general purpose scheme threshold blind signatures 
user free choose pseudonym depending context interacts pseudonym context 
pseudonyms certified distributed fashion threshold signatures tackling sybil attacks 
furthermore certification process threshold signature blinded ensure anonymity 
scenario mobile recommenders introduce application scenario illustrate scheme 
scenario features electronic communities mobile recommenders 
group people community shops oxford street breakthrough idea consists customers sharing shopping experiences mobile devices 
initial community starts grow lead creation communities different shop types beauty shops music shops 
recommendation sharing automatic distributed customers store experiences mobile devices automatically share form recommendations relying central server 
incentive contributions recommenders remain anonymous shopping behavior associated identities fear poorly rated shops 
unique anonymous pseudonym authenticates recommender 
distinguish recommendations bad ones mobile device uses trust model weights contributions highly trusted recommenders untrustworthy recommenders 
distributed trust models may 
generally evaluate recommendation depending quality originator past recommendations 
quality varies example may low recommender misbehaves sends false recommendations 
recommendation sharing service aims improve speed shopping experience recommendations devices collected customers may better short list useful shops current needs 
attacker model order devise robust protocol scheme identify possible attacks 
section focus possible attacks wish protect 
privacy user attacker knows identity victim keeps track interactions 
attacker infers victim habits privacy 
example server corner shop may log recommendation exchanges people happening certain area 
logs server may profile people habits eventually spending behavior 
false accusation user user misbehaving 
scenario cathy device requests recommendation device sends recommendation 
protocol exchanging recommendations requires cathy device pays fee 
cathy device denies having requested received recommendation 
sybil attacks user manage set pseudonyms carry masquerading attacks different entities pseudonyms 
categorize attacks attacked target single entity group entities 
attacks single entity 
identify cases self collusion ballot collection colluding pseudonyms attacker owns 
pseudonyms grouped categories pseudonyms offer services pseudonyms increase remaining pseudonyms reputations recommenders pseudonyms send positive recommendations subset service providers 
attack unfolds follows 
victim selects service providers faked positive opinions 
service providers offer low quality service 
victim lowers trust level abusing service providers 
attacker orchestrated service providers pseudonyms create pseudonyms 
consequence victim attacker profited repercussions 
transposing situation scenario may happen cathy device victim gets pays fake opinions coming consider device manages pseudonyms 
says cathy device suggesting recommenders 
cathy device queries says sharing opinions shops 
cathy device pays opinions 
device shares fake opinions gaining money 
point pseudonym replace newly created pseudonym 
self collusion bad collection pseudonyms corresponding attacker spreads negative recommendations benevolent user 
evaluating unanimous recommendations recipients build negative trust benevolent user 
attacker lowers benevolent user reputation harming 
example cathy device bad cathy pseudonyms 
receiving opinions devices wrongly deduce different devices persons dislike cathy 

attacks group entities 
identify cases insider attack attacker chooses pseudonym joins target group 
externally misbehaves users groups 
consequently lower trust target group 
attacker lowers target group reputation price lowering reputation pseudonym 
example members community music shops community look recommendations beauty shops 
member beauty shops community device pseudonym provides recommendations shops fake ones 
experiencing suggested beauty shops recommendation recipients lower reputation beauty shops community certain extent 
device drops suffer 
outsider attack pseudonym attacker joins groups target group 
joint group builds reputation reliable recommender reaching planned reputation level starts spreading negative recommendations target group 
consequence attacker lowers target group reputation harming 
instance device joins music shops communities pseudonym 
builds reputation recommender starts bad mouth beauty shops community 
stolen pseudonyms user attacker steals victim pseudonym able interactions 
example device steals cathy pseudonym 
misbehaves new pseudonym 
cathy suffer theft 
security requirements desirable features previous section described attacks 
aim designing scheme robust attacks infer security requirements scheme meet anonymity pseudonym reveal information real identity owner preventing privacy non repudiation reputation interaction user prevented denying previous commitments actions avoiding false accusation unique identification user possesses unique valid identifier hindering attacks caused disposable pseudonyms revocation pseudonym gets stolen owner get new price revoking old 
scheme support desirable features general applicability type distributed reputation systems benefits proposed scheme line authentication users authenticate needing involve distributed issuing pseudonyms issuing pseudonyms rely central authority 
protocol scheme scheme consists protocols induction protocol authentication protocol 
shot induction protocol user obtains pseudonym public key anonymous corresponding signature

public key pseudonyms encrypt communication avoiding main middle false accusation attacks 
section describe protocols 
briefly introduce blind threshold primitives 
show bootstrapping procedure 
describe protocols details 
blind threshold signature algorithms protocols scheme borrows protocols algorithms blind threshold signature literature see 
blind threshold signatures allow parties share ability blindly sign messages sign messages seeing parties generate signatures jointly infeasible parties 
setup protocol generates public key kc secrets 
blinding algorithm input message random blinding factor public key kc produces blinded version message 
protocol subset parties input secrets randomizing factors blinded message public key kc produces blind signature message 
algorithm input blinded message random blinding factor extracts message removes blinding factor 
verify algorithm input message corresponding signature determines signature valid message 
partial protocol subset parties input secrets produces partial secrets 
secret algorithm input partial secrets determines single secret 
refreshing protocol parties input old secrets produces new secrets 
community bootstrapping authentication scheme pseudonyms threshold signature 
issued pseudonym needs certified verified certification needs checked 
ensure user pseudonym 
certifying pseudonym means signing threshold scheme private key signatures built secrets owned different party 
verifying pseudonym means checking signature threshold scheme shared unique public key purpose 
certify verify pseudonym collection parties community needs jointly create common public key secret party
