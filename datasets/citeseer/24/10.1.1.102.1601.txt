mobile map interaction evaluation indoor scenario hans rg ller johannes sch ning antonio kr ger institute university robert koch germany joerg mueller antonio krueger uni de providing indoor navigation building usually associated large investments infrastructure 
evaluate approach provide indoor navigation minimal infrastructure investments 
approach people mobile camera device mobile phone magic lens 
device map building way augmented camera image map 
show people system maps errors 
main advantage approach tracking user needed navigation solely user mobile phone maps 
remember situation entered unfamiliar building looking certain person 
probably room number known building plans difficult read 
signs pointing certain departments difficult interpret people fall back social navigation ask 
building big improbable person asked knows way 
scenario propose action entering building take mobile phone point building map 
possible select person looking list poster employees photos 
way selected person displayed camera image buildings map 
maps provided decision points building correct way available 
evaluate approach implemented prototype system tested prototype users different levels building 
related system previous augmenting digital information maps 
magic lens approach implemented 
order track camera device map coordinates optical www com marker tracking approach 
marker approach requires printed markers physical map need visible camera image 
approach robust main advantage special infrastructure needed 
uses physical maps equipped rfid tags provide additional information mobile device means rfid reader needed mobile device 
implementation interaction schema prototype implemented java runs 
installed usb camera back simulate mobile phone camera

evaluation test scenario evaluation took place building institute 
recruited participants age study men women students university 
divided participants categories depending spatial familiarity building beginner medium expert 
beginners familiar building visited time purpose study students departments

mobile camera device group start point navigation users briefly introduced application running mobile camera device 
users select name target person list see 
told maps building mobile camera device provide map overlay showing way current location target destination 
navigation task users free camera device maps see 
case navigation error users took wrong turn experimenter interacted put user back right path 
control group users devices received list persons associated rooms laboratory 
visualization path infer information maps 
navigation errors handled exactly way discussed previous section 
variables independent variables evaluation technology type mobile camera device versus device spatial familiarity beginner medium expert 
dependent variables time needed number accessed maps number errors 
time measured view map arrival destination 
results average users needed seconds complete wayfinding task lab office mistakes average approx 
maps 
average orientation time similar groups variability orientation time camera device group clearly higher 
presumably effect caused different level familiarity type mobile device asked participants explicitly 
control group significantly errors average test variability error rate higher group mobile camera device 
group mobile camera device users able lower number errors see 
number maps significantly higher camera device group control group see 
earlier studies indoor maps total time sec 
total time mobile camera device comparison total wayfinding time users mobile camera device 
graphs show box plots mean value quartiles min max values 
number maps number maps mobile camera device comparison map usage users mobile camera device 
graphs show box plots mean value quartiles min max values 
errors error rate mobile camera device comparison error rates users mobile camera device 
graphs show box plots mean value quartiles min max values 
indicated users problems schematic indoor maps general problem reduced providing dynamic map overlays concrete way instructions 
slightly surprising control group average seconds faster significant device group see 
possible reason fewer maps control group errors big influence wayfinding time users interrupted put back right track 
surprisingly spatial familiarity clear effect number errors 
higher spatial familiarity lower amount errors wayfinding task see 
looking data beginner users camera device group interesting note approx 
amount errors medium users control group 
similar relationship exists medium users camera device group expert users control group 
summary results preliminary user study looking effects navigation system uses maps mobile camera device overlay 
results show dynamic overlay increases navigation performance reducing navigation errors 
interpretations speculative believe study gives idea usefulness simple indoor navigation system mobile camera device 
plan extend studies outdoor scenarios take account effect comparison spatial familiarity classes error rates 
graphs show box plots mean value quartiles min max values 
familiarity mobile device 
experiments wayfinding time measure navigation performance errors influence 
try redesign experiments way wayfinding time gain expressiveness 
planning transfer results outdoor navigation scenarios mainly city overview maps carry user study complex navigation task involving maps 
said main advantage approach tracking infrastructure needed believe cheap easy installation sites approach promising
