open mind common sense original open mind common sense system omcs commonsense knowledge acquisition system targeted general public 
web site gathers facts rules stories descriptions variety simple elicitation activities 
items collected include person younger person mother butcher vegetarian people repeatedly interrupted hold knife blade may cut drop flame burn people pay taxi drivers drive places people generally sleep night omcs running web september

approaches deal problem finding way constrained natural language interface system 
method pull menus user select english forms consistent underlying representation 
method develop subset english restricted easily parsed order logic 
concerned overly restricting users imposing ontological preconceptions took different approach allow users supply knowledge free form natural language 
constructed variety activities eliciting knowledge 
activity user simple story ask knowledge helpful understanding story 
example story bob cold 
bob went doctor user enter bob feeling sick bob wanted feel better doctor bob feel better people doctor wore neck piece medical equipment doctor worn white coat www org commonsense doctor highly trained professional help sick person medicine person probably sick choosing acquire knowledge free form natural language shifted burden knowledge acquisition system methods acquired knowledge

information extraction techniques convert english items standard knowledge representations 
significant progress area information extraction text years due improvements syntactic parsing part speech tagging 
number systems able successfully extract facts conceptual relations complex events text 
approach different way think go building commonsense database

commonsense applications database accumulated proven useful prototyping number commonsense applications 
database build search engines reason users goals 
novice search engine users naturally express search goals topic keywords

example user enters cat sick system inference people care pets care means want health heal sick animals search engine search 
second application developed aria program manages people personal photos 
aria uses spreading activation network sentences omcs statements object classifications spatial relations object purposes causal relations events emotions resulting experiencing objects events improve retrieval annotated photos

different participants prefer enter different types knowledge 

template activities efficient usable form knowledge

workflow model acquisition major difference acquiring knowledge general public acquiring experts users general public leave soon encounter difficult

different people different things 
enter new items

system distributed workflow model different stages knowledge acquisition elicitation refinement restructuring stages may performed separately different participants 
output workflow finalized piece knowledge word senses tagged clarified validated participate inference 
gives participants greater control experience 
omcs allows template input free form input 
workflow sequence template entry follows 
user browses items database finding item associated template user interested 
frees user having learn ontology templates 
template located example 

user clicks template new input form template example items template 

user enters item inferences result item 

user option accepting rejecting inferences 
accepted rejected inferences rules produced inferences tagged accepted rejected added database 
single interaction supplies different types knowledge 
entered items spell checked tagged part speech disambiguated word sense 
user may enter free form sentence

template editor may brought enabling user create new template entered sentence 
user clicks item user various activities refining item

omcs encourages knowledge supplied templates free form english text 
want templates omcs worried able design sufficiently large fully encompassing set templates wanted learn ontology relations users imposing 
collected free form facts extract templates longer feel imposing ontology users 
allow users extend template library 
templates extend multiple lines user enter descriptions simple stories extending multiple sentences 
hope extract larger causal temporal constraints states events lets build structures frames scripts believe critical commonsense reasoning 
type knowledge extensively accumulated previous commonsense acquisition efforts 
mueller compared systems systems acquiring facts rules cases stories analogical reasoning performed 
examples templates include bob hungry bob eats sandwich bob hungry initial set omcs templates templates extracted omcs database 
feedback inference omcs participants complained interesting feedback entering item 
wanted evidence system item feel contributing construction thinking machine just static database 
omcs incorporated inference mechanisms acquisition cycle 
system induces inference rules knowledge people supplied rules immediately feed back inferences entered items 
omcs engages types inference 
methods simple fast necessarily produce accurate rules problem user loop 
inference depends knowledge database stored instances templates

system program piano lake infer want go piano take boat christmas tree candy infer christmas tree covered sugar course examples method succeeds 
presently extending techniques allow system hypothesize just inference rules chains stories 
allows limited forms temporal reasoning finding analogies stories 
narratives stories unified single template representation facts descriptions stories may expressed 
clarification important develop techniques simplify disambiguate contributed knowledge 
restricting vocabulary omcs participants entered expert commonsense knowledge 
way participants enter commonsense knowledge encourage common english words 
formed set common words ranking words omcs number occurrences 
omcs encourage common words suggesting replacements uncommon words entered items 
replacements suggested synonym hypernym dictionary wordnet 
user may accept reject replacements 
word sense disambiguation omcs participants asked enter items simple english produced items easy parse syntactically resulted items difficult disambiguate common words polysemous 
word sense disambiguation known problem natural language processing variety automated semi automated methods exist dealing problem 
date best automated methods achieve accuracy 
open mind word expert web site launched experiment gathering word sense information general public 
similarly omcs introduces word sense disambiguation workflow 
participants required tag sense word sentence 
automated methods suggest sense tags may corrected user 
user disambiguated words system able disambiguate rest words automatically 
user disambiguate words sentence pin meanings words 
organization omcs participants wished organize database browsing easier application developers database wished quickly acquire knowledge particular topics 
ask users supply knowledge items ways index organize items facilitate retrieval application 
users build topic vectors sets concepts related topic 
initially built automatically looking words correlated topic word 
users increase decrease probability membership individual concepts add new concepts 
topic vectors commonly knowledge retrieval cast wider net order retrieve knowledge relevant topic 
dynamic way generating reasoning contexts 
cyc assertion belongs fixed microtheory requires user know microtheories 
system user build topic vectors manually arrange knowledge particular microtheories 
validation repair large collaborative effort important assess user honesty 
set participants relatively small fairly easy filter troublesome users manually 
system grew order magnitude manually filtering users time consuming 
omcs incorporates mechanisms peer review enabling users judge judging samples knowledge 
giving users trust ratings judgments users higher trust ratings greater weight 
employ catch trials described fixed set pre validated sentences users time time order assess truthfulness 
order suggest items review plausibility measures 
words appear ways implausible statistically system raises alarm posts item review 
omcs enables reviewed items corrected subject review
