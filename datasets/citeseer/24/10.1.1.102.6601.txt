operating system middleware research challenges paradigm shift distributed computing brought advent sensor networks requires revisiting basic operating system abstractions tasks intertask communication developing support fundamentally new distributed programming environments 
historically paradigms developed distributed computing purpose creating appropriate abstractions distributed application programmers developing run time systems support abstractions 
examples successful paradigms include distributed object oriented computing corba group communication isis remote procedure calls rpc distributed shared memory munin 
paradigms convenient new entities programmer world composed objects process groups implemented mechanisms interaction 
current paradigms distributed computing share common fact programming abstractions exist logical space inherently represent interact objects activities physical world

section review research directions system architecture sensor networks outline open challenges 
single node challenges lowest system support sensor networks begins level single node 
severe resource limitations reliability considerations real time constraints unpredictability environment call creative implementations basic kernel functions 
new kernels developed manage limited resources single sensor equipped device robust manner 
tinyos earliest operating system kernels developed exclusively sensor nodes :10.1.1.117.697
bytes code tinyos provides support communication multitasking code modularity 
geared communication intensive applications exports abstraction components integrated structures similar protocol graph 
component consists command handlers event handlers simple tasks 
communication protocols constructed easily modular manner developing appropriate handlers independently 
notion modular protocol stacks new great contribution tinyos implement framework memory computing constraints individual sensor nodes 
tasks code virtual machines classical operating systems export abstraction tasks schedulable entities computing resources 
tasks typically thought entities partition single cpu multiple resource owners 
view inherited multi tasking systems built premise cpu powerful execute multiple tasks concurrently 
contrast sensor networks relation reversed 
individual tasks identi cation activity environment typically require collaboration multiple sensors dedicated device little room concurrency 
new operating abstractions needed support distributed task notion 
programming support needed users write linear code appropriate level abstraction executed distributed protocol group cooperative devices membership may depend physical environment meets timing requirements 
distributed virtual machines proposed provide convenient high level abstractions application programmers implementing low level distributed protocols transparently cient manner
