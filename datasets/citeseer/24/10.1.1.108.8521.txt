vi ui set pareto optimal decision vectors called pareto optimal efficient admissible set problem 
corresponding set objective vectors called non dominated set 
practice unusual terms interchangeably describe solutions multiobjective optimization problem 
notion pareto optimality step practical solution multiobjective problem usually involves choice single compromise solution non dominated set preference information

applications evolutionary algorithms optimization aggregating functions reported literature 
number authors syswerda jakob jones provide examples popular weighted sum approach 
target vector optimization consists minimizing distance objective space goal vector 
report problem atomic emission spectroscopy 
goal attainment related technique seeks minimize weighted difference objective values corresponding goals methods wilson macleod monitored population nondominated solutions 
multiple attribute utility analysis maua conjunction gas suggested horn nafpliotis experimental results 
handling constraints penalty functions davis steenstrup goldberg example additive aggregating function 
fact penalty functions generally problem dependent consequence difficult set richardson prompted de velopment alternative approaches ranking powell skolnick 
population non pareto approaches schaffer see schaffer grefenstette probably recognize possibility exploiting ea populations treat objectives separately search multiple non dominated solutions concurrently single ea run 
approach known vector evaluated genetic algorithm vega appropriate fractions generation sub populations selected old generation objectives separately 
crossover mutation applied usual shuffling sub populations 
non dominated individuals identified monitoring population evolved information vega 
shuffling merging sub populations corresponds averaging normalized fitness components associated objectives 
fact expected total number offspring produced parent sum expected numbers offspring produced parent objective 
schaffer proportional fitness assignment turn proportional objectives 
resulting fitness corresponded linear function objectives weights depended distribution population generation 
previously noted richardson 
confirmed schaffer 
consequence different non dominated individuals generally assigned different fitness values contrast definition non dominance suggest 
linear combination objectives implicitly performed vega explains population tended split species particularly strong objectives case concave trade surfaces phenomenon schaffer called speciation 
fact points concave regions trade surface optimizing linear combination objectives set weights noted fleming 
vega plain weighted sum approach suited address problems concave trade surfaces weighting scheme implicitly implements deserves closer attention 
vega objective effectively weighted proportionally size sub population importantly proportionally inverse average fitness terms objective population generation 
doing assuming sub population sizes remain constant objective vega selection adaptively attempts balance improvement objective dimensions performers objective cause corresponding average performance increase objective weight decrease accordingly 
way sharing techniques goldberg richardson see promote balanced exploitation multiple optima search space 
reason vega cases maintain different species generations ga optimizing pure weighted sum objectives fixed weights due genetic drift goldberg 
unfortunately balance reached necessarily depends scaling objectives 
fourman addressed multiple objectives non aggregating manner 
selection performed comparing pairs individuals pair objectives 
version algorithm objectives assigned different priorities user individuals compared objective highest priority 
resulted tie objective second highest priority 
known lexicographic ordering ben tal 
second version reported surprisingly consisted randomly selecting objective comparison 
similarly vega corresponds averaging fitness fitness components component weighted probability objective chosen decide tournament 
pairwise comparisons essentially different linear combination objectives scale information ignored 
tournaments constitute stochastic approximations full ranking resulting fitness closer ranking population objective separately consequent averaging individual ranks 
population may see convex trade surface concave depending current distribution course problem 
kursawe formulated multiobjective version evolution strategies ess 
selection consisted steps objectives 
step objective selected randomly replace ment probability vector dictate deletion appropriate fraction current population 
selection survivors parents generation 
kursawe implementation multiobjective selection possesses number similarities vega fourman second method individuals extremes trade surface appear eliminated soon objective performed poorly selected dictate deletion individuals survive 
objectives stood certain chance part selection generation possible specialists survive deletion process generate offspring die immediately generation 
kursawe notes deletion individuals randomly chosen objectives creates non stationary environment population converging try adapt constant change 
hinted different choices objectives result significant changes cost landscape seen es generation 
diploid individuals goldberg smith improved ability adapt sudden environmental changes population expected converge picture trade surface produced points evaluated run 
weighted sum approach hajela lin exploited explicit parallelism provided population search explicitly including weights chromosome promoting diversity population fitness sharing 
consequence family individuals evolved weight combination concurrently 
pareto approaches methods schaffer fourman kursawe hajela lin attempt promote generation multiple non dominated solutions goal reportedly achieved reasonable degree success 
direct actual definition pareto optimality 
population monitored non dominated solutions schaffer kursawe 
pareto fitness assignment proposed goldberg means assigning equal probability reproduction non dominated individuals population 
method consisted assigning rank non dominated individuals removing contention finding new set non dominated individuals ranked forth 
fonseca fleming proposed slightly different scheme individual rank corresponds number individuals current population dominated 
non dominated individuals assigned rank dominated ones penalized population density corresponding region trade surface 
algorithm proceeds sorting population multiobjective ranks previously determined 
fitness assigned interpolating linearly best worst individuals population averaging individuals multiobjective rank 
selection performed baker stochastic universal sampling sus algorithm 
srinivas deb implemented similar sorting fitness procedure goldberg version pareto ranking 
combining pareto dominance partial preference information form goal vector provided means evolving region trade surface 
basic ranking scheme remains unaltered pareto comparison individuals selectively excludes objectives satisfy goals 
specifying fully unattainable goals causes objectives excluded comparison corresponds original pareto ranking 
changing goal values search alters fitness landscape accordingly allows decision maker direct population zoom particular region trade surface 
tournament selection pareto dominance proposed horn nafpliotis see horn 

addition individuals competing tournament number individuals population help determine competitors dominated 
case competitors dominated non dominated result tournament decided sharing see 

implemented tournament selection goldberg pareto ranking scheme 
approach individual ranks decide winner binary tournaments fact stochastic approximation full sorting population concavity trade set related objectives scaled 
performed fonseca fleming srinivas deb 
convexity trade surface depends objectives scaled 
non linearly rescaling objective values may convert concave surface convex vice versa illustrated 
darker surface original concave trade surface corresponding plotting denotes vector free variables 
lighter surfaces correspond plotting clearly convex 
formulations minimization problem admit exactly solution set phenotypic space 
order preserved monotonic transformations pareto ranking blind convexity non convexity trade surface 
say pareto ranking precludes speciation 
speciation occur certain regions trade simply easier find pareto ranking eliminate sensitivity possible non convexity trade 
second possible advantage pareto ranking rewards performance objective dimension regardless solutions exhibit performance objective dimensions produced recombination 
argument applies extent population methods described previous subsection necessarily treat non dominated individuals equally 
argument assumes degree independence objectives hinted schaffer vega noted detail louis rawlins 
pareto selection may help find solutions exist rarely case multiobjective optimization 
assumption loosely coupled objectives hold near admissible region argument may valid initial stages search 
niche induction techniques pareto ranking correctly assigns non dominated individuals fitness guarantee pareto set uniformly sampled 
multiple equivalent optima finite populations tend converge due stochastic errors selection process 
phenomenon known genetic drift goldberg observed natural artificial evolution occur pareto evolutionary optimization 
additional fitness sharing goldberg richardson deb goldberg proposed goldberg prevent genetic drift promote sampling pareto set population 
fonseca fleming implemented fitness sharing objective domain provided theory estimating necessary niche sizes properties pareto set 
horn nafpliotis arrived form fitness sharing objective domain 
addition suggested metric combining objective decision variable domains leading called nested sharing 
performed sharing single objective dimension diversity appeared important 
srinivas deb performed sharing decision variable domain 
sharing mainly pareto ranking fonseca fleming srinivas deb pareto tournaments horn nafpliotis horn noted hajela lin implemented form shar ing stabilize population regions trade surface 
vega selection noted earlier implement sort sharing mechanism sharing introduced gas goldberg richardson 
viability mating aspect relevant population distributes multiple regions optimality 
different regions trade surface may generally different genetic representations ensure viability requires mating happen locally goldberg 
far mating restriction implemented distance individuals objective domain directly fonseca fleming indirectly hajela lin 
mating restriction multiobjective eas appear widespread 
sharing mating restriction objective domain necessarily combine objectives produce distance measure may appear contradiction philosophy pareto selection 
uniform sampling pareto set meaningful requirement scaling objectives 
sharing phenotypic domain abandons requirement replaces uniform sampling admissible set 
sharing pareto selection ideally orthogonal effects pareto selection promotes improvement exerting scale independent selective pressure population direction normal trade surface sharing attempt balance distribution population front applying possibly scale dependent selective pressure tangentially surface 
unfortunately possibility sharing objective domain may concentrating search effort regions trade surface favour improvement regions detriment discarded 
performing fitness sharing decision variable space srinivas deb provide selection mechanism truly independent objective scaling long guidelines setting sharing parameters domain multiobjective case developed 
fortunately guidelines may available outside ea community 
fact share count calculation sharing recognized form kernel density estimation silverman dimensions studied heuristics setting corresponding smoothing parameter read niche size suddenly 
advanced methods density estimation adaptive smoothing available 
heuristics dimensionality space sharing performed population statistics sample covariance matrix function optimized function outside density estimation problem may provide general approach niche size setting current deb goldberg 
discussion handling multiple objectives strongly interacts evolutionary computation fronts raising issues generally accommodated broad classes fitness assignment search strategies 
fitness assignment extension evolutionary algorithms multiple objective case mainly concerned multiobjective fitness assignment 
preference information incorporated fitness function approaches range complete preference information combining objective functions directly prioritizing preference information pareto ranking include case partial information provided order restrict search part pareto set 
progressive refinement partial preferences possible eas 
independently preference information provided assigned fitness reflects decision maker understanding quality utility points assessment 
selection step ea seen decision making problem involving alternatives individuals population 
fitness landscape associated multiobjective problem clearly depends fitness assignment strategy 
consider simple problem simultaneously minimizing exp surface plots functions exp surface plots objectives shown 
note axis inverted facilitate visualization 
corresponding trade surface shown earlier 
individuals ranked members population outperform fonseca fleming ranking large uniformly distributed population normalized population size interpreted estimate fraction search space outperforms particular point considered 
global optima ranked zero 
applies equally single objective ranking 
plotting normalized ranks decision variables case produces anti fitness cost landscape actual fitness landscape inferred 
clearly population evolves distribution longer uniform cost landscape induces change dynamically 
static landscapes considered provide insight different selection mechanisms 
surfaces may help explain behaviour eas selection mechanisms expected predictive ea performance considered isolation 
static cost landscapes example shown figures corresponding different fitness assignment strategies ranking 
cost landscape induced ranking objective separately shown 
normalized rank cost landscapes defined ranking objective separately contour plots corresponding objective functions illustrates single objective ranking sum objectives 
peaks arise due problem exhibiting concave trade surface 
importantly peaks remain longer symmetric objectives weighted differently 
surface seen scaled representation cost landscape induced vega selection uniformly distributed population case average performance population objectives clearly illustrates trade surface concavities lead peaks cost surface obtained linearly combining objectives 
speciation vega corresponds population distributing persistent peaks balanced way objectives corresponding highly populated peaks weighted performance terms corresponding objective increases causing population shift peaks equilibrium reached 
result genetic drift controlled different species maintained peak long run 
average ranks computed objectives shown 
case single peak located middle pareto optimal set concavity trade surface longer apparent 
binary tournaments objective drawn random fourman expected define similar landscape 
shows cost landscape ranking maximum objectives simple case goal programming 
single peak normalized rank normalized rank cost landscape defined ranking sum objectives contour plots individual objective functions normalized rank cost landscape defined ranking objectives separately averaging ranks located non smooth ridge direct gradient optimization difficult 
reason alternative formulations usually preferred approach 
example goal attainment method proposed avoids problem introducing auxiliary scalar parameter solving min subject fi wi gi gi goals design objectives fi wi weights specified designer 
pareto ranking 
note pareto optimal set defines ridge shaped plateau cost landscape 
desired plateau includes admissible solutions possible optima produced coordinatewise monotonic function objectives steuer methods figures just examples 
normalized rank cost landscape defined ranking maximum objectives search strategies normalized rank cost landscape defined pareto ranking ridges defined fitness landscape pareto ranking minimax approaches may parallel decision variable axes follow straight line 
ridges equivalently valleys need occur single objective optimization hlenbein schlierkamp voosen appear context certainly expected multiobjective problem 
ridge shaped plateaus raise problems encountered types multimodality 
firstly genetic drift may lead poor sampling solution set 
fitness sharing proved useful addressing problem requires closeness measure 
secondly mating performing individuals different may viable lead production unfit offspring 
mating restriction objective domain absence mating altogether interprets individuals populating pareto front continuum species 
seeks reduce formation encouraging formation offspring similar parents means exploratory search 
non random mating strategy adopted hajela lin fonseca fleming 
alternative interpretation pareto set genetically similar viable family points require search suitable genetic representation addition solution location optima known prior optimization 
fixed genetic representation produces viable family points necessarily correspond pareto set 
ridges impose second type difficulty 
theoretical results wagner show biologically reasonable assumptions rate progression unconstrained phenotypes certain types ridge shaped landscapes bounded case decreases rapidly number decision variables increases 
fast progression achieved genetic operators tend produce individuals stay inside corridor 
self adaptation mutation variances correlated mutations ck implemented evolution strategies addresses problem tried pareto search 
binary mutation usually implemented genetic algorithms particularly destructive ridge expresses strong correlation large number decision variables 
applies discrete recombination decision variables produce offspring vertices hypercube defined mating parents 
similarly single point crossover concatenated binary strings change decision variables 
uniform crossover syswerda shuffle crossover caruana biased respect value decision variables may altered single recombination step 
multiobjective fitness landscapes non stationary dm allowed interact search process change current preferences objective functions remain unchanged

combinations genetic search local optimization resulting lamarckian developmental baldwin learning gruau whitley may provide means addressing difficulties imposed ridge shaped landscapes 
question fitness assignment method better remains largely open pareto methods promising lack sensitivity possible concavity trade surface 
comparative studies multiobjective eas available date wilson macleod srinivas deb vega understandably strong point comparison remained largely qualitative 
extensive quantitative comparison multiobjective eas reported literature far hardly surprising 
ideally quality point trade surface produced assessed meaning performance multiobjective eas vector quantity 
trade surfaces produced sets runs different eas compared meaningful preferably statistically sound way 
scaling objectives affect comparison 
questions need answered 
case time may right ea users implementors consider experimenting available multiobjective ea techniques real world problems losing sight alternative approaches 
cautionary word due 
noted independently horn nafpliotis fonseca fleming pure pareto eas expected perform problems involving competing objectives may simply fail produce satisfactory solutions due large dimensionality size trade surface 
number competing objectives increases search space expected conform definition pareto optimality theoretical problem finding non dominated solutions easier 
unfortunately total absence preference information ea face impossible task finding satisfactory compromise dark occur pure chance
