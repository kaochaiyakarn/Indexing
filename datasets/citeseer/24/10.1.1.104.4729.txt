inconsistency feature single central model visual space 
experiments rensink regan clark ledoux convincingly demonstrate humans construct full monolithic model environment 
humans tend represent immediately relevant environment representations full access 
humans monolithic control 
naive introspection observation lead believe neurological equivalent central processing unit decisions controls functions organism 
undoubtedly control structures model single unitary control system supported evidence cognitive science

subject selected chicken head match chicken leg explaining verbally dominant left hemisphere saw claw picked chicken 
right hemisphere picked correctly match snow left hemisphere explained need clean chicken shed ledoux 
separate halves subject independently acted appropriately side falsely explained choice

experimental results kismet interacting person face 
face moving slowly robot looks interested happy 
face begins move quickly robot begins show disgust eventually leads anger 
face tells caretaker robot needs played 
contrast robot receives overly intense face stimulus extended period time social drive moves regime robot displays expression disgust 
expression tells caretaker interacting inappropriately robot moving face rapidly overwhelming robot 
similarly robot receives overly intense non face stimulus perceiving large slinky motions extended period time robot displays look fear 
expression tells caretaker interacting inappropriately robot probably moving slinky stimulating robot

face recognition obvious step simple face detection
