wikis semantic wikis traditional wiki systems wiki short form derived hawaiian expression wiki wiki meaning fast quick 
wiki essentially collection web sites connected hyperlinks 
wide range wiki systems available mediawiki different purposes audiences share common properties editing browser 
content usually edited simple browser interface installing additional expensive software 
editing simple allows modify pages world minimal technical requirements 
consequence content creators access update wiki home conferences nowadays travelling 
simplified wiki syntax 
content usually expressed simplified hypertext format wiki syntax easier non technical users html 
formatting require knowledge html 
rollback mechanism 
changes content wiki versioned time stored previous versions pages kept 
allows revert earlier versions page case important parts accidentally deleted undesirable modifications 
wiki systems allow compare versions page making possible identify changes edits quickly 
strong linking 
pages wiki usually strongly linked hyperlinks 
reason simplified wiki syntax easy define link page wiki 
example wikis link defined enclosing word square brackets called word contains upper case letters 
links non existing pages usually rendered different colour 
user clicks link system redirects view create non existing page 
wikis way create page 
links wiki important tool navigation 
systems allow follow links direction defined reverse direction back links 
unrestricted access 
wiki systems access completely unrestricted correct modify complete delete 
strange dangerous traditional perspective practice shows system works hand ill meaning users rare hand changes easily undone rollback mechanism 
note wikis allow apply access restrictions users groups traditional content management systems 
collaborative editing 
mentioned properties combined wikis ideal tool collaborative editing 
soon creates content contribute extend correct wiki systems provide support collaborative editing means discussion forums summaries changes list updates 
groupware content management tools wiki gives users complete freedom content development process rigid workflow access restrictions predefined structures 
users need adapt practice dictate system allow practice define structure 
important different domains require different kinds workflow

main idea inherent structure wiki strong linking pages accessible machines agents services mere navigation 
generally done annotating existing navigational links symbols describe meaning 
link mozart salzburg annotated lived born 
annotations useful purposes enhanced presentation displaying contextual information enhanced navigation giving easy access relevant related information enhanced semantic search respects context addition content 
note presentation navigation search done generic manner profit greatly adaptation represented context 
semantic wikis exist different flavours semantic mediawiki ikewiki :10.1.1.94.6443:10.1.1.60.6095
systems primarily focused page content see annotations optional added value 
semantic annotations foreground important actual content 
different systems serve different purposes extending existing content annotations allow better navigation collaborative ontology engineering commonly features typing annotating links 
virtually semantic wikis allow annotate links giving certain types 
idea link carries meaning mere navigation example section 
way link annotations edited differs system system 
semantic wikis include annotations part wiki syntax semantic mediawiki provide separate editor adding annotations ikewiki 
context aware presentation 
semantic wikis change way content semantic annotations 
include enriching pages displaying semantically related pages separate link box displaying information derived underlying knowledge base box graphical tree presentation license information rendering content page different manner suitable context multimedia content vs text content 
semantic navigation 
traditional wiki allows follow link semantic wiki offers additional information relation link describes 
information offer additional sophisticated navigation 
instance links independent textual context displayed separate related information box 
page describing mozart offer separate box categorised lived composed semantic search 
semantic wikis allow semantic search underlying knowledge base 
usually queries expressed language sparql rdf query language proposed 
semantic search users ask queries retrieve pieces composed mozart retrieve documents license permits derivative works 
reasoning support 
reasoning means deriving additional implicit information facts entered system predefined user defined rules knowledge base 
example fact mozart composed die te system capable reasoning deduce mozart composer 
reasoning important feature supported wikis 
reasons time consuming memory intensive yield results expected traceable user
