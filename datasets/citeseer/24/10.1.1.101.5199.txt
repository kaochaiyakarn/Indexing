dbmss tp monitors provide acid transaction model default applications transaction management services 
basic transaction model requires enforcement acid properties atomicity consistency isolation durability allows application interleave long produce results equivalent non interleaved execution 
acid transaction model appropriate workflow applications 
example acid transaction model enforces task isolation permit task cooperation 
restrictive workflows require task interaction 
ctm technology satisfies requirements 
particular ctm supports definition enforcement etms 
application specific support workflow applications specialized requirements correctness reliability functionality require task cooperation 
user defined define constraints built code tmm enforces application requirements object provided guarantees may change 
augmented require correctness reliability capabilities may supported object corresponding system 
multi system support applications require access objects maintained multiple systems extend acid transaction model typically supported dbmss tp monitors refer transaction model properties extended transaction model etm 
application specific etms define correctness reliability requirements applications implementing workflows 
transactional workflows workflows supported etm defines workflow correctness reliability criteria 
particular mapping workflows extended transactions involves 
mapping workflow tasks constituent transactions extended transaction supported etm 
mapping workflow structure extended transaction structure supported etm 
ensuring workflow execution obeys correctness criterion defined etm 
typically workflow requirements diverse single etm sufficient meet needs workflows 
need introducing etms extend traditional acid transaction model typically supported dbmss allow additional application functionality permit task collaboration coordination required ad hoc workflows improve throughput reduce transaction blocking abortion caused transaction synchronization recognized time 
etms proposed refer frameworks defining comparing etms representative etms representative model specification support application specific transaction properties views relationships workflows etms :10.1.1.43.3839:10.1.1.39.41
acid transaction model extensions resulted application specific etms offering adequate correctness guarantees particular application ensuring correctness 
furthermore etm may impose restrictions unacceptable application required 
existing etm satisfies requirements application new etm defined 
give example section 
etms user defined built effectively support variety transactional workflows diverse possibly conflicting etms ii etm changes may result evolution workflow experience correctness reliability requirements correctness constraints may relaxed imposed gain experience application 
traditionally system developed particular application designed provide built transaction model supporting application requirements 
systems selecting appropriate etm responsibility system designer 
doms wfms supports single built etm satisfy requirements diverse transactional workflows take advantage application experience re definition workflow etm 
defining augmented etm involves comparing etm correctness requirements correctness guarantees provided systems determine etm enforced local systems 
local system enforce etm ctm provides additional correctness reliability guarantees complement provided system meet etm requirements 
example consider doms transactional workflow requires correctness reliability guarantees similar provided acid transactions 
satisfy workflow requirements ctm provide acid transactions objects 

dependencies result execution structure transaction dependency problem supporting multi system transactions partially investigated research transaction management multidatabase systems 
multidatabase transactions transactional workflows may consist acid transactions may levels transaction task nesting :10.1.1.43.3839
specification transactional workflows 
specification transactional workflows involves specification etms define correctness criteria structure 
etm specification observation extended transactions consist set constituent transactions corresponding workflow tasks set transaction dependencies corresponding workflow structure correctness criterion 
transactional workflow involves nesting constituent transactions transactional workflow may extended transactions 
transactional workflow kinds transaction dependencies intra workflow transaction dependencies define relationships constituent transactions inter workflow transaction dependencies define relationships transactional workflows illustrate transaction dependencies consider new service provisioning workflow illustrated 
simplify discussion suppose subset new service provisioning workflow includes tasks particular assume executed telephone customer requests telephone service installation 
task performs transaction registers billing information customer database 
tasks execute transactions perform alternative line provisioning functions 
provisioning tasks allowed complete result completed circuit set lines equipment connects customer telephone network 
attempts provide connection existing facilities lines slots switches 
succeeds cost provisioning minimal requested connection established allocating existing resources 
successful completion activity may possible facilities place capacity existing facilities exhausted 
achieves objectives involves physical installation new facilities 
higher cost needed fails contingency transactions 
category intra workflow transaction dependencies transaction state dependencies 
dependencies category conditions transaction state define execution structure transactional workflows 
defining intra workflow transaction state dependencies involves transaction semantics abort commit specify ordering workflow tasks 
specifications precise allowed workflow specification languages wfms typically provide 
depicts dependencies define execution structure assuming commits execute concurrently constituent transactions transaction state dependencies 
commits

abort commits 
committed second category intra workflow transaction dependencies correctness dependencies specify concurrent executions transactional workflows preserve consistency produce correct results defining correctness criterion 
correctness dependencies include serialization dependencies specify operations performed set transactional workflows serializable 
visibility dependencies define operations performed set transactional workflows recoverable strict rigorous 
cooperation dependencies define set transactional workflows may perform specific operations specific objects restrictions 
temporal dependencies specify set transactional workflows perform operations particular temporal order 
dependencies sufficient ensure correctness transactional workflow example inter workflow transaction serialization dependencies operations performed operations performed committed transactional workflows serializable 
note dependency require constituent transactions appear atomic 
intra workflow transaction cooperation dependencies contingency transactions need appear atomic 
cooperative dependencies may result situation transactions able construct complete circuits line equipment 
circuits require exclusive access lines unacceptable provisioning workflows 
semantics particular telecommunications application permits number alternative transactions long allowed commit lines
