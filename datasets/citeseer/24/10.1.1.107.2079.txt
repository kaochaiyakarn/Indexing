difficulty collecting data tuning weights easier create data mismatches matches database images query corresponds mismatches single match 
data squares fit tend give weights skewed finding mismatches best squares fit data query target pair score close 
alternative equal sized sets matched mismatched image pairs means throwing lot perfectly useful inexpensive data
