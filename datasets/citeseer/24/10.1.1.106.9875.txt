wiki syntax simple allows creation links textual markup lists headings 
wikis commonly support binary data attachments versioning change management change notification full text search access control 
wikis lately popular tools personal organisational knowledge management 
knowledge workers individually organisations deploy internally project organisations collaborate restricted access wikis 
considering requirements personal knowledge management wikis support authoring collaboration enable knowledge reuse limited support finding reminding structured access wiki possible arises browsing searching information 
example currently query wiki systems information structured textual 
example users looking old john wrote brief european authors won nobel price literature ask questions directly 
navigate page contains information read 
complicated queries require background knowledge users need manually combine knowledge sources 
example structured access information page navigation wikis allow users easily links page pages links navigate related pages 
explicit links means navigation explicit connection related pages authors back appear page show pages 
publishing navigation possible pages 
knowledge reuse wiki content possible limitation apparent aggregations translations content need provided reusing information aggregation common real world 
consider example books generally written author published author publisher 
books authored john page automatically appear books published random house page 
creating view currently possible wiki information copied maintained manually 
current wikis assumed people speak common language usually english translations languages provided 
manually translating pages maintenance burden wiki system recognise structured information inside page text 
example page john contains structured information birth date books authored publisher 
updates information migrated manually translated versions page 
limitations result lack structure wiki content information written natural language little semantics 
example page author john contain link page novel brief 
english text say john wrote brief information machine understandable querying navigating translating aggregating information 
semantic wikis semantic wiki allows users formal descriptions resources annotating pages represent resources 
regular wiki enables users describe resources natural language semantic wiki enables users additionally describe resources formal language 
authoring effort relatively low semantic annotations similar layout structural directives widespread ordinary wikis 
formal annotations resources semantic wikis offer additional features regular wikis 
users query annotations directly show authors create views queries 
users navigate wiki annotated relations go books john users introduce background knowledge system authors show authors 
designing semantic wiki system architectural decisions need taken

content store stores data rdf allowing full power rdf query languages

user interface responsible user interaction

user interface allows users type text annotations freely intermixed fashion 
user interface shows terms shared ontologies enabling users browse appropriate term page server includes ordinary wiki functionality mentioned section version management binary attachments access control 
parser converts text written user objects parses text semantic annotations layout directives links

content store responsible storing retrieving semantic annotations exchanging data information systems semantic wikis 
rdf triple store

xml wif data analyser responsible computing set related resources page 
regular wiki means just find back pages link current 
semantic environment relations resources richer 
data analyser uses annotations current page parser searches relevant relations content store books current author persons parents current 
annotation language user semantic wiki visible change compared conventional wikis modified annotation language 
semantic wikis annotation language responsible change text style creating links semantic annotation wiki pages writing embedded queries page

embedded queries executed page visited results included displayed page example show aggregations books written john embedding queries page allows knowledge reuse persistently combining pieces different sources

query returns books written creates view data displayed page text 
information access information accessed structured navigation querying facilities 
navigation navigation ordinary wikis limited explicit links entered users possible navigate information structural relations 
semantic wiki provides metadata necessary navigate information structured way 
example knowing john author show authors system offer navigation 
views resulting embedded queries read editable 
editable views cause maintenance issues change recorded version history result page page affected edit similar view update problem databases 
john author retired lawyer 
rdf type foaf person dc publisher query shows books book dc creator dc creator dc creator dc creator fig 

page showing embedded query approach structural navigation faceted meta data browsing 
faceted browsing information space partitioned orthogonal conceptual dimensions facets data constrain relevant elements information space 
example collection art works consists facets type time periods artist names geographical locations common faceted browsing approaches construct facets manually specific data collection 
semantic wiki users free add arbitrary metadata prohibiting manual facet generation 
developing technique automatically generating clustering facets see details 
querying distinguish kinds querying functionality keyword search queries views 
keyword full text search useful simple information retrieval supported conventional wiki systems 

structured queries annotations allow advanced information retrieval 
user query wiki pages resources satisfy certain properties 
retrieve example authors query type author 
triple patterns combined form database joins type author publisher retrieves authors publishing companies 

discussed earlier users create persistent searches embedding queries pages

navigating information reuse addresses noted limitations ordinary wikis 
concerning structured access users find related information associative browsing wiki analyses semantic relations data provides navigational links related information 
users search information structured queries addition simple full text search 
concerning information reuse semantic annotations allow better translation maintenance annotations language independent understood reused barriers 
users write embedded queries creating saved searches database views 
views revisited reused provide consistent picture structured information 
furthermore annotations language independent ontologies contain label translations easier translating general knowledge 
information represented rdf standard semantic web terminologies allows information exchange 
related describes architecture semantic wikis focuses annotating representing page structure concerned page content discusses specific implementation decisions generic architecture choices 
approaches improve wikis augmenting semantic annotations 
platypus wiki semantic annotations adding annotations requires significantly effort normal text 
wiksar semantic wikipedia offer easy annotations allow reuse existing semantic web terminologies allow simple annotations current page exclude blank nodes 
wikis successful information collection fully satisfy requirements personal knowledge management 
shown semantic wikis augment ordinary wikis metadata annotations offer better information access structured navigation faceted browsing structured queries knowledge reuse embedded queries information exchange
