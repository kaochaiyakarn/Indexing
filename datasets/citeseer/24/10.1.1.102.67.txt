important mention far efforts relied relatively simple techniques inadequate real user profile data resilient noise typically user traversal patterns 
web mining involves data mildly severely corrupted noise 
outliers incomplete data easily occur data set due wide variety reasons inherent web browsing logging

computing dissimilarity matrix absence priori knowledge unsupervised classification clustering method ideally suited partition user sessions 
major classes clustering techniques object data feature vectors relational data similarities dissimilarities data 
class clustering algorithms popular received lot attention suitable clustering user sessions explained earlier 
chose relational approach clustering data sessions numeric nature 
approach requires definition computation dissimilarity similarity session pairs relation matrix prior clustering process 
paragraphs introduce similarity measures user sessions proposed 
measures attempt incorporates structure site urls involved 
consider simple case individual attributes urls accessed sessions totally independent structure site ignored 
simply cosine angle measure similarity seen simply measures number identical urls accessed sessions relative number urls accessed sessions 
desirable properties problem similarity measure completely ignores hierarchical organization web site adversely affect ability capture correct profiles 
example session pair courses cmsc courses cmsc session pair courses cmsc research receive similarity score 
evident sessions similar second users sessions interested courses 
similarly expect sessions courses cmsc projects proj similar courses cmsc projects courses cmsc overlap urls sessions directory hierarchy tree 
leads define similarity measure structural url level computation similarity session level 
model web site tree nodes representing different urls 
nodes essentially directory structure rooted server document root links redirects aliases explicitly brought 
edge connects node url corresponding hierarchically located example courses courses cecs 
root tree node incoming edges corresponds document root server 
account syntactic representation urls similarity assessed comparing location corresponding nodes tree 
done comparing paths root tree nodes 
define syntactic similarity urls denotes path traversed root node node corresponding url indicates length path number edges included path 
note similarity lies basically measures amount overlap paths urls 
similarity session level incorporates syntactic url similarities defined correlating url attributes similarities sessions follows similarity uses soft url level similarities vary depending similar hard similarities depending different identical respectively 
special case urls accessed session zero similarity urls accessed session reduces sessions identical value simplifies considerably small depending number urls accessed 
means similarity measure unintuitive ideally similarity maximal identical sessions 
identical sessions similarity generally underestimated session pairs share identical urls rest unshared urls low syntactic similarity 
general sessions syntactic url similarities low provides higher accurate session similarity 
hand syntactic url similarities high higher accurate 
define new similarity sessions takes advantage desirable properties follows purpose relational clustering similarity mapped dissimilarity note squaring complement similarity effect amplifying difference 
similar different sessions 
dissimilarity measure satisfies desirable properties metric distance possible distinct sessions zero dissimilarity 
measure occurs equivalently 
particularly true url level similarities urls accessed sessions 
typical example consists sessions courses cecs courses cecs html 
property desirable application consider sessions fit profile 
session dissimilarity measure violates triangular inequality metric distances cases 
instance dissimilarity sessions courses cecs courses cecs zero 
dissimilarity courses cecs courses cecs
