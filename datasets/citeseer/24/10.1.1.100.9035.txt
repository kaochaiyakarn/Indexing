canonical vs individual models dimension characterizes major difference classical human factors flexible models needed provide individualized interfaces software control allows 
variety computer systems designed canonical user model 
example robertson newell ramakrishna frame system facilitates user computer communication 
design heavily influenced factors response speed necessary prevent user frustration 
example system built model canonical user genesereth automated consultant macsyma symbolic mathematics package genesereth

individual models enable systems provide user interface appropriate needs provided canonical model 
course necessary demonstrate exist techniques implementing models improve performance system 
variety techniques section 
decision exploit individual user models profound impact aspects user modeling 
system possesses single model canonical user model designed directly incorporated system structure 
hand system ultimately possess large array models corresponding users question models constructed arises 
leads second dimension space user models 

explicit vs implicit models ways systems different different users 
allow users modify system suit 
approach taken systems allow users create explicitly environments system 
consider example computer program enables system users communicate sending mail messages back forth 
program stores messages set files provides functions users read messages answer forth 
systems allow users set system parameters determine things message fields displayed message printed 
greater degree personalization provided systems implementations programming language lisp allow users specify arbitrarily complex program automatically executed user enters system 
facility user create procedures alter system variables define symbols 
approach seen personalized data base systems borman 
systems personalization comes fact user explicitly select documents information interest store private data base 
approach leaves quite lot responsibility hands user probably appropriate systems expect truly naive users people system times non trivial amount expertise required order able know wants specify specify 
way approach problem personalization provide system information users take charge personalization 
done trivially intelligent way 
trivial example program asks user rate level expertise system 
program uses level determine information provide error messages 
program essentially contains models information people level possess 
sophisticated approach automatic user modeling needed systems order deal need information user problem users tell system needs know 
examples problem occur domain computer aided instruction cai 
cai system needs know individual student knows doesn know knows incorrectly 
student unfortunately know doesn know knows incorrectly 
course students lack knowledge 
lot evidence psychological literature support assertion people reliable sources information see example nisbett wilson mcguire singer 
addition lack accuracy inherent explicit models consideration argues allowing system build user models 
people want answer large number questions get trying system 
particularly true people intend system times brief periods 
best serve users system form initial model user immediately system 
initial model known characteristics system user community additional information system individual user example job title set facts characterizing new user system 
person interacts system provides additional information 
acquires information system gradually update model user eventually comes model individual distinct canonical user 
approach greatest effort expended construction models frequent users effort expended models extremely infrequent users models little payoff user satisfaction
