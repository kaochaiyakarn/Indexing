couple researches including proposed frameworks querying logical information units web 
approaches discover retrieve logical information units classified ways follows 
static approach dynamic approach static approach approach statically divides web graph fixed subgraphs corresponding logical documents 
query issued logical information units including keywords returned 
approach natural consequence original observation exist web data logical information units intended page authors 
advantage approach employ complex analysis information unit detection causing response latency query execution analysis done advance phase index creation 
dynamic approach approach dynamically finds information unit including query keywords time query issued 
approach partition web graph units variable depending query 
existing researches minimal subgraphs including query keywords approximations information units matching query 
minimal subgraphs may part information unit may spanning multiple documents 
give priority subgraphs part single document uses query relaxation schemes size graph uses ranking algorithms 
advantage dynamic approach return best results mentioned 
classification information unit discovery page contents approach analyzes contents pages order detect logical information units 
example researches term frequencies neighboring pages subgraphs compared similar neighboring pages subgraphs merged logical information unit 
hand uses similarity tagging patterns neighboring pages 
techniques capture semantics documents natural language processing techniques may effective 
link structure approach information hypertext structure 
example graph theoretic properties various kind connectivity fun fun clue detecting strongly related pages 
dynamic approaches size subgraphs query relaxation schemes answer ranking 
directory structure useful information find web data directory structure embedded url 
usually reflects intention page authors useful guess links intended standard routes set pages intended composing single document 
develop new techniques discovering retrieving logical information units web data 
adopt dynamic approach particularly minimal subgraph approach 
reason choice static approach straightforward solution problem retrieval logical information units quite difficult detect units perfectly 
cases author oneself tell pages composing single independent document 
minimal subgraph approach practical 
problem dynamic approach cost dynamically traverse web graphs find minimal subgraphs 
examine arbitrary subgraphs usually include subgraphs clearly part single logical document 
searching subgraphs wasting time 
need method eliminate clearly wrong cases early phase 
cost grows especially average fun number going links page large 
reducing number links traverse effective reduce cost 
research eliminate links intended page authors standard routes part single document looking directory structure urls 
dynamic approach query relaxation scheme ranking algorithm essential explained

words appear page words related 
example suppose long links page listing links brief explanations 
query keyword appears near top page query keyword appears near bottom page keywords related strongly

measure strongly words page related appearance density words 
appearance density word position calculated frequency word window position 
regard reflecting importance degree influence word position 
calculate appearance density words need select window function 
consider document sequence words suppose denotes length sequence 
window function defines weight value position sequence 
simple window function rectangular window function gives position window fixed width gives 
hanning window function 
hanning window function centered defined formula width window range non zero weight 
gives maximum value center window gets smaller gets far center 
appearance density word position hanning window function defined follows defined word appears position sums weight values positions word occurs 
consider expresses importance word position area high locality word shows examples docu ment top occurs twice distance longer width window 
examples document separate part form window function shown right document 
document bottom occurs twice distance shorter width window 
document shown right document 
case parts corresponding occurrences overlaps graph sum graphs window function 
order measure importance relative positions document normalize peak document
