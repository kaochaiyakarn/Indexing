programming mentality dominates previous conceptions smart home services provide interaction techniques affords language express control home 
bachelor pads aside homes multiple occupants systems need account multiple users complexity creates 
designing social greatly limits interactions smart home may capable delivering situations users want exert control violates core principles design 
multi user approach especially relevant system needs address household activities fundamentally collaborative 
people perceive chores activities procedures systems approach smart home services combination operations performed confederation devices

families described chores laundry dinner expect design systems conform mental models systems understand laundry refers devices washing machine dryer iron steps required describe various sub tasks people want help 
activity laundry extend wider set activities laundry depends including having soap separating colors additionally potential services smart home offer independent specific procedures locations devices

ownership chores complex account social environment need reflect complex ambiguous responsibility accountability tasks home 
primary importance tasks nature collaborative 
chores follow interesting patterns large number chores families evolved specialized preferences patterns assigning responsibility 
families treated tasks food shopping laundry entirely collaborative activities obfuscating notion single person exert exclusive control information pertinent completion activities 
smart home confronted social reality simple ambiguity chore ownership 
smart home reaches decision point chore owner absent unavailable 
smart home assign responsibility absence 
thermostat rules don agree smart homes accept input multiple users means deciding inputs conflict

see major tasks fall fieldwork 
task define services deliver value cognizant conforming embedded social constraints identify 
second task create expressive flexible language allows families customize services match wide variability homes customs cultures 
address point turn 
develop valuable services augmenting core capabilities home smart home allow families develop different potentially deeper relationship home 
relationship manifested choice services offered manner services delivered 
research valuing efficiency example want suggest applications help remind people pending tasks walked door 
tasks known non time provide reminders 
fieldwork shows people entry house highly valued moment services valuing efficiency violate great relief brought moment entry 
importantly fieldwork revealed particular susceptibility dual income families cascade coordination failures 
fieldwork brings light need system support pressing user need 
interestingly fieldwork suggests way deliver services 
research exploring reminder services describe way receive advice servant 
metaphors accommodate wider vocabulary service design delivery 
example research shows opportunity smart environment take duties provided exclusively stay home mom vision extends house mission role shelter proactive position managing coordinating information needs individuals anticipating alerting individuals hidden impending dependency failures ultimately occupying position social support 
fieldwork suggests reminder services pay close attention economy motion chain dependency activities 
regarding economy motion reminder provided places individuals expend energy wasting valuable user patience 
system understanding existing traffic patterns know people cross boundaries provide reminder critical moment individuals directional decisions 
reminders involve basketball practice example need account chain dependency activities 
reminder includes note laundry delivered game time provide sufficient time needed dependent activities take place 
suggests need interaction technique allows people easily identify describe unique dependencies activities participate system cognizant include reminding functions 
customization control dual income families depend substantially homes maintaining sense control augmented environment presents important challenging contribution 
dey note users experience control customize context aware applications 
control depends language allows families express seen wild variety preferences 
creation language forms central part research interests 
long term vision requires create assortment application concepts examine elements common see common elements find expression language allowing families programming smart home 
challenge consist identifying activities occupy sweet spot flexibility enduser programming provide kind services valuable 
services hot water heater totally predictable customization provide little value 
conversely events variable people want eat dinner defy expression language event exception 
hope find sweet spot custom services provide value families invest customization process
