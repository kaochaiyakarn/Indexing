components vs designs frameworks just reuse techniques 
ideal reuse technology provides components easily connected new system 
software developer know component implemented specification component easy understand 
resulting system efficient easy maintain reliable 
electric power system buy toaster store television home office 
people know ohm law trouble connecting new toaster power system 
unfortunately software nearly composable electric power system 
design software component trade simplicity power 
component thing easy fewer cases 
component parameters options harder learn 
reuse techniques range simple inflexible complex powerful 
developer choices usually complicated require training part developer 
example easiest way get compiler buy 
compilers compile language 
hand build compiler language reusing parts gcc sta parser generator reusable backend code generation 
takes expertise build compiler gcc just compiler approach lets compile language 
decide gcc flexible language concurrent depend garbage collection write compiler scratch 
don reuse code probably design ideas gcc having separate parser 
learn ideas textbook compilers 
component represents code reuse 
textbook represents design reuse 
source gcc lies 
reuse experts claim design reuse important code reuse applied contexts common 
applied earlier development process larger impact project 
developer expertise partly due knowing designs customized fit new problem 
design reuse informal 
main problems reusing design information capturing expressing br 
standard design notation standard catalogs designs reuse 
single standardize 
lead industry wide reuse 
original vision software reuse components mci 
commercial interest object oriented technology focused code reuse indicated brad cox software ics cox 
pure design reuse popular seen form patterns ghjv bmr cs fow 
frameworks intermediate form part code reuse part design reuse 
frameworks eliminate need new design notation object oriented programming language design notation 
programming languages suffer defects design notations necessary desirable specialized tools frameworks 
programmers framework tools compilers 
reuse frameworks motivations 
main save time money development 
time market increasingly important companies build frameworks decrease time market 
find uniformity caused frameworks just important 
graphical user interface frameworks give set applications similar look feel reusable network interface mean applications follow protocols 
uniformity reduces cost maintenance maintenance programmers move application having learn new design 
final reason frameworks enable customers build open systems mix match components different vendors 
spite motivations predictions software reuse discussed years ago come true 
reuse small part development projects 
exception world object oriented programming environments user interface framework 
framework 
key ideas underlies frameworks class 
class class instances superclass gr 
class usually unimplemented operation deferred subclasses 
class instances template creating subclasses template creating objects 
frameworks designs components 
way class acts design specifies interface subclasses 
client indicates wants instance class means instance class meets interface class 
class usually provides part implementation subclasses 
example template method defines skeleton algorithm class deferring steps subclasses ghjv 
step defined separate method redefined subclass subclass redefine individual steps algorithm changing structure 
class leave individual steps unimplemented methods provide default implementation hook methods pre 
concrete class implement methods superclass may implement hook methods 
able methods inherits superclass 
framework larger scale design describes program decomposed set interacting objects 
usually represented set classes way instances interact jf 
includes way instances classes interact collaborative model pattern object interaction kinds classes design 
important part framework way system divided components deu deu 
frameworks reuse implementation important reuse internal interfaces system way functions divided components 
high level design main intellectual content software frameworks way reuse 
frameworks take advantage distinguishing characteristics object oriented programming languages data abstraction polymorphism inheritance 
data type class represents interface implementations change 
polymorphism ability single variable procedure parameter take values types 
object oriented polymorphism lets developer mix match components lets object change collaborators run time possible build generic objects wide range components 
inheritance easy new component 
framework describes architecture object oriented system kinds objects interact 
describes particular kind program user interface network communication software decomposed objects 
represented set classes usually kind object interaction patterns objects just part framework classes 
characteristics frameworks inversion control 
traditionally developer reused components library writing main program calls components necessary 
developer decides call components responsible structure flow control program 
framework main program reused developer decides plugged new components plugged 
developers code gets called framework code 
framework determines structure flow control program 
widely framework developed late smalltalk user interface framework called model view controller mvc gol kp lp 
mvc showed object oriented programming suited implementing graphical user interfaces 
divides user interface kinds components models views controllers 
objects consisting view controller interacting model 
model application object supposed independent user interface 
view manages region display keeps consistent state model 
controller converts user events mouse movements key presses operations model view 
example controllers implement scrolling menus 
views nested form complex user interfaces 
nested views called subviews 
shows picture user interface standard tools smalltalk environment file tool 
file tool subviews 
top subview holds string pattern matches set files middle subview displays list files match pattern bottom subview displays selected file 
subviews model

smalltalk file tool st file list st mini st train st user interface 
edit self 
subview hierarchy file tool template operations displaying different kinds views require different display algorithms 
concrete subclasses view unique display algorithm 
user moves mouse subview controllers activated deactivated active controller controller view managing region display contains cursor 
class controller implements protocol ensures subclass controller automatically inherits ability cooperate controllers 
class object provides dependency mechanism views detect model state changes 
object model 
versions smalltalk added model class provides efficient version dependency mechanism ps 
file tool typical model view controller application need new subclasses view controller 
user interface consists entirely objects classes standard part smalltalk class library 
smalltalk class library contains dozen concrete subclasses view controller

successful frameworks evolve spawn frameworks 
user interface frameworks influenced model view controller designed specifically implementing macintosh applications sch

return frameworks powerful just kind application framework reduce amount effort develop customized applications order magnitude 
probably better think frameworks components different cooperating technologies 
frameworks provide reusable context components 
component assumptions environment

framework provide standard way components handle errors exchange data invoke operations 
called component systems ole beans really frameworks solve standard problems arise building compound documents composite objects 
kind framework provides standards enable existing components reused 
second way frameworks components frameworks easier develop new components 
applications infinitely variable matter component library eventually need new components 
frameworks new component user interface smaller components widget
