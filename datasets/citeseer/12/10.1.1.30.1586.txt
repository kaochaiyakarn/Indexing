claim order adequately represent actions events needs explicit temporal logic approaches weaker temporal models state spaces strips approaches situation calculus handle problems require dramatic extensions effect grafted explicit temporal logic earlier formalism 
furthermore formalisms extended way temporal logic part dominate original formalism plays little role solution 
primarily defend position proposing specific temporal representation showing handle wide range situations problematic formalisms 
particular properties actions events feel essential general representation 
actions events take time 
events may instantaneous occur interval time 
time may rich structure 
instance event driving car involves wide range different actions states world complications activity stretch time nicely described single event 
events extended time different events actions may overlap time interact 
am driving rock gas tank gasoline drains may stranded highway arriving time 
able represent reason complex interactions 

relationship actions events effects complex 
effects true event remain true time event 
example put book table effect book table short time action completed 
effects hold event progress 
instance consider flashlight button flashing 
light button pressed 
effects start hold event started holding finishes 
example am walking school usual route time walk bridge crossing river 
effect action true 

actions events may interact complex ways overlap occur simultaneously 
cases interfere certain effects arise events done isolation 
cases effect performing actions may completely different effects isolation 
radical case consider wristwatch controlled buttons pressing changes mode display shows alarm time setting 
pressing simultaneously turns alarm 
effect performing actions simultaneously causal relation effects actions performed isolation 

external changes world may occur matter actions agent plans may interact planned actions 
possible external events important factor reasoning effects action 
certain goals accomplished depending external events 
example sail lake put depend wind blowing bring event

representing actions events starting formal development attempt describe intuitions motivating representation 
consider commonly accepted representations action ai meet needs 
intuitions actions events issue concerns event take position events primarily linguistic cognitive nature 
world really contain events 
events way agents classify certain useful relevant patterns change 
restrictions event consist involve object stretch time involve change state 
circumstances world described number events 
instance consider circumstance ball rolled table bounced floor 
description happened 
set circumstances described event ball fell table ball hit ground ball dropped 
descriptions different way describing circumstances packaged description event occurred 
description correct may informative certain circumstances help predict required information suggest way reacting circumstances 
course states world referred ways classifying world inherent world 
set circumstances described partially described terms ball red 
say differences events states 
intuitively describes change describes aspects change 
language say events occur states hold 
easy blur distinctions 
falling table floor clearly describes change describes event circumstance agent john holds door shut couple minutes 
door remains shut time doesn change state john holding door shut occured event 
issues studied extensively semantics natural language sentences 
proposals agrees basic distinctions dowty 
prime relevance sentences describe states world ball red john believes world flat sentences describe general ongoing activities john ran hour events john climbed mountain 
types sentences different properties important distinctions occur relation time 
sentences true interval time 
state holds interval time conclude state held subintervals ball red entire day red morning 
property termed homogeneity temporal logic literature 
events hand generally opposite property anti homogeneous event occurs interval doesn occur subinterval completed 
ball dropped table floor time subinterval just air table floor 
activities hand fall 
may homogenous holding door shut example describe dynamic aspect world events 
type distinction appreciated general purpose knowledge representation action change 
general point intervals time play essential role representation events 
events defined occur intervals time reduced set properties holding instantaneous points time 
course semantically define time intervals ordered pair time points truth conditions defined terms ordered pairs terms individual points 
specifically interval simply set points points truth interval defined terms truth points interval predicate homogeneous 
word actions 
word action different senses different people 
action refers person robot 
way classifying different sorts things agent affect world resembles sensory motor program event 
performing action agent causes event occur turn may cause desired events occur 
instance action walking may perform hope causing event walking car 
theories refer event caused action intend 
draw analogy robot situation view actions programs 
performing action described terms running program 
situation calculus situation calculus means different things different researchers 
original formulation mccarthy hayes call general theory situation calculus situations introduced ontology complete snapshot universe instant time 
effect situation calculus point temporal logic branching time model 
common call constructive situation calculus highly restricted form proposed green way situations introduced constructing action composition initial state 
practice attracted attention precisely formalism constructive specifically planning 
plan goal prove exists situation holds 
proving situation constructed action composition desired sequence actions plan extracted proof 
pointed schubert criticisms expressibility situation calculus concern constructive form general theory

general theory hand richer extended model closer proposing loss constructive aspect 
see difficulties consider simple example

train initially starts originating city 
trip typically takes hours 

cars remain attached train entire trip 

train track segment cross junction track segment rest trip

logic events logic developed far insufficient conveniently capture circumstances need reason 
particular need introduce events objects logic 
reasons important discussed remainder section 
davidson argued potentially unbounded qualifications included event description 
example event jack lifting particular ball asserted occur time predicate lift lift jack ball 
problem arises representing event jack lifted ball table 
need add argument lift predicate need introduce new predicate represents variant lifting includes extra argument 
satisfactory 
case predicates describing event occurrences contain large number argument positions typically unspecified particular event description requiring large number existential variables 
case large class predicates asserting essentially thing 
put bound number argument positions needed solutions viable 
fact add additional information event captured parameter forcing add 
natural language creates particular difficulty representing adverbial modifiers 
davidson suggested solution reifying events additional modifiers simply additional predications event 
event jack lifting ball table represented lift jack ball dest table instrument issue reifying events issue representing natural language meaning 
sophisticated plan reasoning system needs represent reason events similar complexity 
addition forms plan reasoning system able distinguish events information distinguish 
instance plan recognition task agent know separate lifting events occurred knows little 
reified logic easy state lift lift logic situation represented complex formula growing size number arguments 
lift predicate took arguments need formula lift lift cumbersome formulation committed able distinguish lifting events basis arguments 
davidson argument accepted number qualifications unlimited able express situation 
representation event variables central component organizing knowledge events 
particular events divided types type defines set role functions specify arguments particular event instance 
event jack lifting ball table time represented lift agent jack dest table theme ball time event predicates written small caps distinguish functions predicates 
logic containing reified events allows discuss events occur 
particular asserting event instance exists necessarily entail occurred 
new predicate occurs introduced assertion jack lifted ball time represented lift jack ball occurs 
explicit occurs predicate allows events exist occur occur 
need expressive power proceed interpretation events occur exist 
having put occurs predicate formula simplify presentation 
representation somewhat verbose presenting examples 
needed point representation functions events 
times standard predicate argument notation convenient abbreviation 
usually abbreviate formula lift jack ball table arguments predicate argument form depend predicate argument positions time event event instance respectively 
note event predicates anti homogeneous hold sub interval time hold discussed section 
representation role functions event instance uniquely defines arguments 
important remember predicate argument abbreviation 
particular asserted lift lift true entail fact obvious predicate argument form clear functional form 
represent knowledge events ways 
defining necessary conditions event occurring 
instance consider event block stacked robot 
described event predicate form stack 
axioms define consequences event occurring 
instance assert stack event occurs block second block action 
predicate argument notation written stack oe functional form axiom stack oe time block block course necessary conditions order stacking event occur 
instance say block moved block clear event starts agent holding block time event event block block clear just event block immediately event completes 
event terminates time block block 
information expressed directly temporal logic axiom stack oe clear overlaps holding finishes clear clear useful form axiom planning uses temporal functions event define structure temporal intervals needed definition 
example oe oe oe oe oe oe stack clear pre clear pre holding con clear eff eff necessary conditions stacking class stacking events need functions produce times corresponding existential variables axiom 
new function names define temporal structure stacking event follows stack oe overlaps pre finishes con pre con eff pre eff temporal functions named informally suggest classes conditions arise event definition 
preconditions conditions hold prior event occurrence prefix pre effects conditions hold event prefix eff conditions hold event prefix con 
temporal functions viewed skolem functions justified original axiom 
aspect puzzling skolem functions axioms 
viewed notational convenience allows large conjunctive axiom single universally quantified event variable smaller axioms 
temporal structure defined stacking event axiom defining necessary conditions event occurrence expressed follows stack oe clear pre holding con clear eff clear pre eff axiom shown graphically 
axiom asserts true stacking event occurs independent situation 
knowledge events relevant certain situations event conditional effects 
instance block moved stacking action initially block block clear 
expressed logic axiom states block initially block clear moved stack overlaps oe con clear oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe stack clear pre holding con clear eff clear pre eff clear conditional effects stacking initially situation illustrated graphically 
axiom applies situation blocks originally block note definition assert block clear stacking event 
particular stacking events overlap time say stack stack may case may placed placed representations easily represent subtleties 
worth noting conditional effect axiom complicated interval ontology fact demonstrate typical pattern 
notice lefthand side implication contains proposition right hand side contains new interval defines extent property event occurred 
formulation bit cumbersome occurs conditional effect 
easy define abbreviation convention specifying axioms convenient 
course events needed represent simple events occur blocks world temporal logic overkill 
interested realistic events may significant knowledge world changes event occurs 
quick example consider event cup filling water 
cup full event occurring level water continually increasing 
commonsense knowledge event easily captured interval logic 
instance fact level water continues rise event captured axiom fill oe oe oe level level level function gives minimum level water cup time axiom captures intuition water continually rises quite simply directly making commitment continuous model change 
dealing events involve continuous change focus examples involve simple actions common literature planning reasoning action 
wonder logic separate mechanism describing processes 
may ultimately necessary existing formalism supports wide range process predicates 
particular define property true event occurring

furthermore stacking action causes block clear affect condition block clear

jack robot action execution program involved correct control sequences perceptual input 
robot world action corresponds program event corresponds situation program executed successfully 
noted section action corresponding event consisting agent performing action 
exploit names events actions 
stack predicate previous section correspond action term stack denotes program correspond blocks stacked 
course events involve actions 
example natural forces wind blowing result events involve action sense 
actions may arbitrarily complex activities decomposable complex actions may decomposable certain basic level action attained 
primitive actions called basic actions goldman

assert axiom defining conditions sufficient guarantee successful action attempts 
case stacking agent tries stack starting situation clear stacking event occurs temporally constrained initial conditions try stack clear overlaps clear oe stack course realistic axiom include duration constraints action attempted sufficiently long allow succeed 
note logic presuppose particular relationship action performed event caused occurs 
constraint need commonsense notions causality caused event precede action caused 
simultaneous event included time action performance immediately follow action 
practice forms axioms common useful 
simultaneous causality action event caused simultaneous example stacking event temporal action execution recall abbreviation stack implies time 
causality event immediately follows action say action pushing ball causes roll hill 
note issue action relates event independent event relates effects distinctions

sandewall hiding turkey scenario quite naturally handled simple case reasoning triggered external events 
setting turkey may deaf 
deaf go hiding gun loaded escape death shooting 
information turkey respond certain situation hide hears gun loaded 
conclude shooting turkey alive deaf dead 
formalizations problem treat turkey hiding conditional effect loading gun external event 
approach worked triggered external events justified 
unfortunately works simplest cases event caused structure temporal complexity characterized static effect 
example consider situation place turkey hide box box door closed agent 
natural formalization include facts ffl turkey deaf try hide gun loaded 
ffl box door open turkey tries hide hidden seconds 
capture situation adding new effect rule loading box door open turkey hide 
clear encode fact turkey hidden seconds shoot quickly hit 
scenario complicated information packed load action hiding event 
done unintuitive allow reason turkey hiding case agent loads gun 
turkey may hide reasons spontaneously decide hide hides pm pm 
clearly hiding just valid event event loading requires similar treatment 
return simple example originally formulated 
deaf atemporal predicate triggering hiding loading captured conditional generation axiom load deaf oe hide time time capture simplicity original problem solutions literature assume hiding simultaneous loading 
natural formulation complicate proof need reason agent shoot turkey trying hide 
need add axioms hiding events axioms 
edef hide oe hidden eff time eff excp hidden hidden oe hide time hide oe deaf load time time edef axiom simply states hide event results turkey hidden 
excp closure axiom says things hidden result hide event occurring 
closure axiom justified important information implicit problem statement turkey hide hears gun loaded

triggered events useful characterizing domains 
example press button start machine trigger event 
formalism allows define behavior machine full power language describe events 
pressing button trigger complex sequence events greatly affects domain extended periods time 
simple example involve making simple meal pizza 
plan put pizza microwave oven press start button 
cooking take beer refrigerator get dishes 
microwave beeps take pizza eat 
fact microwave running constrain actions perform time 
instance couldn coffee microwave 
electric service limited able run toaster oven time blowing fuse 
simple scenario sounds representing capabilities formalisms 
definite events definite events viewed generalization triggered events arbitrary constraints events occur 
cases easily handled temporal logic 
instance am time interval am am fact sun rise time simply sunrise am event defined axiom sunrise oe pre eff pre eff problem arises system infer sun doesn rise importantly set times constraints allow 
information stated prevent 
problem formalism 
problem axiom doesn capture know sun rising 
fact know rises day 
revised axiom needed look follows am defined today time interval entire day includes am 
sunrise am sunrise today oe words sun rising event am sun rising event today 
note better capturing actual knowledge event constructed closure axiom gives exactly right behavior 
mistake tried handle case uniform strategy events model minimization automatically generated closure axioms appropriate axiom depends specific knowledge event 
external event say different characterization occurs twice day complex structure 
spontaneous events final class external events considered involves events occur contrast definitely occur discussed 
agent knowledge events class occur possible events interfere agent plan time 
result minimization strategy applied events result overly optimistic plans reasoning similar proof failure prove event occurs doesn occur 
course strategy eliminates possibility representing spontaneous events 
event possible spontaneously occur time represented absence closure axiom whatsoever 
event significant effects effectively prediction process 
claim exactly right 
consider turkey shoot domain agent may unload gun time 
situation impossible construct plan guaranteed kill turkey 
point plan agent unload gun fired 
introducing notion probability best purely logical theory 
interesting cases arise events may occur spontaneously certain conditions say agent unload gun agent nearby agent interfere morning agent unload gun times 
constraints spontaneous events occur agent may able concrete predictions effects set actions 
need minor extension formalism allow specify constraints spontaneous events 
specifically new predicate spontaneous introduced asserts event instance spontaneously occured 
events planned say spontaneous captured axioms form oe spontaneous events occur spontaneously similarly declared non spontaneous axiom says guns load spontaneously load oe spontaneous events may occur spontaneously may caused agents actions axiom way leaving open possibilities 
interestingly events may spontaneous certain conditions represented axioms 
instance unload event may occur spontaneously agent nearby appropriate axiom unload oe spontaneous agent nearby unload event occur spontaneously 
leaves possibility open spontaneous unloading event circumstances 
note encoding notion possibility form ignorance 
event spontaneous prove spontaneous spontaneous prove spontaneous possibly spontaneous prove spontaneous spontaneous 
possibility spontaneous events closure axioms developed earlier need modified events occur spontaneously 
simply accomplished adding new disjunct allowing spontaneous occurrence 
instance new closure axiom unload unload oe try unload spontaneous unload event occurs agent attempts unload action spontaneous 
agent isn nearby previous axiom eliminate possibility unload event spontaneously occuring occur agent explicitly 
example consider hiding turkey scenario 
suppose know turkey may hide spontaneously know restrictions hiding may spontaneously occur 
extended closure axiom hide oe deaf load time time spontaneous proof sketched go 
turkey deaf able prove turkey didn go hiding spontaneously 
able show deaf alive shooting deaf won know alive 
course situation interesting 
instance know turkey spontaneously hide times say hide evening 
easily expressed 
axiom constraining spontaneous hiding events hide time oe oe time oe spontaneous axiom states hiding spontaneous occurs allows possibility spontaneous 
result original proof go times 
particular prove turkey killed deaf shoot time appropriate axioms ordering 
interesting observe concerned prediction need axioms explicitly assert event definitely spontaneous prediction process driven closure axioms require prove spontaneous order prove persistence 
considering additional reasoning tasks domain explanation explicit axioms stating event spontaneous useful 
abductive nature explanation explanations involving provably spontaneous axioms require fewer assumptions explanations simply assume event spontaneous 
considered explanation techniques developed kautz plan recognition adapted easily representation 
discussion formalisms prohibit external events 
example action definitions strips systems encode changes world external events fundamentally banned analysis 
similarly constructive situation calculus problem way express information state world action happening mechanism allowing event occur action performed 
lifschitz lifschitz limited mechanism handle allowing occur action performed explain effects expected 
allow external events occur independently actions give events class status required represent complex situations 
addition minimizing number approach difficult handle uncertainty external event occur 
possibility encode external events pseudo actions result function clearly different normal actions agent couldn plan execute 
addition situation calculus typically represents possible futures initial state notion actual 
simply state event occur say noon tomorrow 
obvious way capture axiom guarantees possible action sequence extends past noon tomorrow includes appropriate place sequence 
represent information need able quantify possible action sequences including actions overlap 
formalism extended way loses constructivity constructive situation calculus attractive formalism reasoning action 
problematic external events conditional agent behavior simply may may occur independent agent 
event occurs reasoner consider situations constructed action sequence doesn occur sequence 
forces change interpretation situations 
external events situation defined action sequence indicated possible attainable find plan goal needed find sequence resulting situation true 
external events may sequences produce situation true finding guarantee goal achieved situation may attainable 
example situation true constructed external event agent guarantee occur situation may attainable 
situation calculus addresses external events typically rejects constraints constructive approach uses general formalism 
approaches situations arbitrary states world necessarily related particular action sequence 
addition situations associated times time line quantify situations 
introduce occurs predicate asserts particular action occurs specific time defined axiom quantifies situations time pinto miller shanahan 
development moves formalism closer proposing 
ultimately main difference approach extended situation calculus representations explicit time probably approach 
start representation actual world agent beliefs world introduce mechanisms allow reasoning effects possible actions 
situation calculus starts representation possible futures actions introduce mechanisms dealing information actual world 
reasoning external events going complicated formalism believe approach superior reasons 
allows problems formalized simpler feel direct manner 
second representation closer types representations implemented knowledge representation systems appears suitable deriving practical applications planners natural language understanding systems 
main weakness lack notion possible futures 
modal operator possibility needed independently temporal reasoning reasoning action 
combining modal operator linear time model phi phi phi phi phi phi phi phi phi phi phi phi phi phi corning avon bath track track track example trains domain map allow express expressible situation calculus 
advantage combining needs single mechanism 
interestingly demonstrates wide range problems solved explicit modality 
simultaneous action levels difficulty dealing simultaneous actions 
model described far handles cases simultaneous actions ffl actions occur simultaneously ffl occur simultaneously independent ffl additional effects individually 
difficult case actions partially conditionally interfere 
describing basic approach handles cases discuss approaches reasoning interference 
prefer complex domain illustrate cases 
trains domain transportation manufacturing domain developed trains project allen schubert 
goal project build intelligent planning assistant proficient natural language 
domain involves cities connected rail links warehouses factories various cities engines transport goods 
simple trains domain map examples follow shown 
domain interacting simultaneous actions external events unavoidable aspects domain 
independent mutually exclusive actions actions independent existing formalism exactly right thing 
effect actions simply sum effects actions individually result get directly axioms 
simple interactions mutual exclusion actions certain circumstances behavior typically naturally falls reasonable axiomatization domain 
example consider simplified axiomatization concerning engines moving cities ranges engines cities tracks move action moves engine track etry try move oe etry try move oe edef oe eff eff etry states trying move track city city engine track 
etry states track clear agent attempts move engine event occurs 
edef states occurs engine ends destination city 
addition axioms general knowledge domain includes fact object different places means track clear engine ax oe ax engine oe note added special knowledge move actions interact axioms capture range intuitions domain 
example consider scenario shown engines corning 
tries move avon track tries move bath track simultaneously get destinations 
scenario axiomatized follows ax ax engine engine engine oe ax track track ax ax corning ax try move avon track ax try move corning bath track prove time avon bath true 
proof consider proving avon 
etry ax get track ax get track 
ax ax give track ax etry gives avon track edef gives avon eff eff required 
exactly parallel proof shows bath eff eff shown actions intended effects 
actions interfere domain knowledge block unwanted inference events occured successfully 
instance consider variant scenario engines try track ax try move corning track ax try move corning track case able prove event occurs 
reason move actions create situation engines track 
prevents etry conclude little events caused actions 
notice fact actions attempted true 
general limit action attempts way reflecting belief agent may attempt actions time 
conditions appropriate actions simply won cause desired events 
course add additional axioms describing happens action attempts interact 
instance add dramatic axiom asserts move actions attempted simultaneously track engines crash 
realistically predict deadlock situation events engines returning originating cities 
point temporal logic provides fairly natural way axiomatize knowledge domain capture desired behavior 
form interaction simultaneous action attempts resource conflicts 
instance trains domain engine requires fuel trips 
engines planning trips fuel station engine succeed 
cases require reasoning quantities introduce complications necessary points 
resources modeled unitary resource don 
cases techniques adapted resources 
fact view track previous example resource required engine trip problem engines try track resource conflict 
constraints simultaneous action arise limitations part agent 
restrictions cast terms resource conflicts temporal logic allows specific axioms action occurrence 
instance say engineer try couple car decouple time 
constraint simply captured axiom try couple try decouple oe axiom set assertions agent simultaneously attempted couple car decouple inconsistent 
axioms useful defining simple planning systems similar non linear planners allen 
synergistic effects easy define additional synergistic effects occur actions occur simultaneously 
instance define events occur actions performed simultaneously 
agent lifts piano agent lifts entire piano lifted floor 
situations easily described representation 
example assuming axioms lif action causes lift events specify simultaneous lifting ends piano results piano lifted generation axiom lift lef lift right oe lift fact actions events durations allows somewhat realistic requiring lifting ends overlap simultaneous lift lef lift right oe lift function refers interval common non disjoint 
realistic version axiom require ends lifted long 
realistic example synergistic effects involves performing action events occurring possibly caused actions cause additional effects 
consider example trains world illustrates 
decouple car engineer activate engine moving forward 
actions engineer simultaneous engine moving forward event triggered engineer action setting throttle 
scenario axiomatized follows etry try oe move etry try activate oe activate etry states setting throttle triggers moving event 
etry states activated engineer holds activator button 
events need occur simultaneously car results car uncoupled 
knowledge captured conditional generation rule involves events left hand side 
possible axiomatization move activate coupled oe edef oe coupled eff eff says move activate events overlap temporally engine car coupled prior simultaneous moving activating event occur time events overlap 
edef simply states effect uncoupling engine car coupled 
complete example need encode commonsense closure axioms fact move event continues engineer throttle 
prove engineer sets throttle activates simultaneous occurrence move activate events result car decoupled 
interference complications handling simultaneous actions events arise partially interfere interfere certain conditions 
note view events classifications patterns change sense talk events interfering 
world characterized events definitions mutually inconsistent 
interference sense talking actions 
instance agent trying open door performing push action hoping cause event 
simultaneously agent pushes door way agent performed push action event occurred 
say push actions interfered 
case cancelled 
course action attempts affected external events occurring simultaneously 
consider cases 
action interacts events occurring interaction treated handled conditional effects action attempts different properties hold 
technique formalizes problem terms events different effects result synergistic interaction events 
example consider situation want load boxcar automatic hopper 
push start button hopper tips dumps cargo boxcar 
course requires boxcar appropriate location hopper 
boxcar hopper start clear loading car occur hopper emptied 
interesting case occurs boxcar initially hopper moves away loaded 
intuitively say moving boxcar interferes loading car 
hopper empty boxcar contain cargo 
simple axiomatization actions events 
pushing start button causes event occur occurrence event entails hopper empty etry try oe edef oe empty eff eff addition need axiom moving captures fact move event occurring car continually changing position ax move oe oe course place time ax oe information boxcar hopper loaded cast event generation axiom followed axiom defining loading events oe load edef load oe loaded eff eff think uncontroversial characterization general knowledge agent need reason domain 
needed reason interaction 
instance consider situation agent pushes start button boxcar hopper boxcar moving 
suitable assumptions duration events definition move event prove time event boxcar hopper 
load event inferred axiom 
course crude axiomatization purposes illustrating technique 
better characterization axioms enable reasoning changes occur loading action 
done doesn add point 
may true characterize interactions simultaneous actions terms events way 
ultimately require reducing events characterizing physical force equations 
fact suggested papers addressing simultaneous action pednault 
believe appropriate commonsense theory action requires agents understand physics world fairly deep level order understand simple everyday interactions 
examples show need method characterizing agent knowledge action attempts interact performed simultaneously 
instance armed robot know lift large small block individually lift small blocks simultaneously tries lift large blocks tip 
knowledge captured directly axioms etry block try lif overlaps try lif oe lift etry try lif try lif oe lift lift etry try lif try lif oe ax lift oe criticize solution saying just wrote answer 
exactly knowledge agent acquire short amount experimentation domain 
reasonable assume agent relatively complete knowledge actions attempt certain period time negative conditions etry easy prove 
fact haas idea build reactive planner uses explanation closure 
event formalization level plausible solution solves problem reasoning force equations require detailed knowledge domain 
mccarthy ab predicate mccarthy etry allow incrementally add conditions entail abnormal lifting attempt 
standard nonmonotonic method minimize ab risk losing information cases robot uncertain 
instance axioms say happen agent simultaneously lifts small block large block 
reflects fact agent doesn know 
technique predicate minimization lin shoham agent assume tip possibly dangerous assumption 
explanation closure techniques ab predicate allow leave cases uncertain 
agent knowledge actions interact external events 
example consider agent knowledge driving car 
action turning ignition starts event engine running try level oe function level produces minimum level gas time engine running pressing accelerator causes car move forward try oe move axioms capture interaction agent action simultaneously occurring external event directly requiring deep understanding underlying causal model cars 
addition agent knowledge engine running event fact requires gasoline tank consumes gasoline runs oe level oe oe level level note axiom expressed event formalized static property precondition moving car 
capture information single framework engine running formalized event 
discussion part treatments simultaneous actions literature limited

pednault allow synergistic effects cast terms domain constraints states state left side piano lifted right side lifted piano lifted 
situation calculus shows promise action composition operators

actions independent reasonable solutions long actions instantaneous appears theory remain constructive 
approaches easily extended handle complex cases actions duration may temporally related complex ways

explored possibility allowing duration action gelfond 
duration sequence actions simply sum individual action durations 
little point doing allows extended actions overlap actions external events

approach provides range techniques representing information interacting actions

believe flexibility important building comprehensive knowledge bases contain information wide range situations applicable different reasoning tasks

problems significant open issues temporal durations 
realistic characterization examples require capability 
instance realistic say agent tries turn ignition car length time engine start 
action tried short time engine probably won catch 
action tried long time starting motor burn 
durations play critical role 
glance adding durations pose problem 
simply defines function interval returns value metric scale 
small number axioms required define appropriate properties function 
pursued complicate examples remove attention main points case simple metric model doesn solve problem 
consider action starting engine
