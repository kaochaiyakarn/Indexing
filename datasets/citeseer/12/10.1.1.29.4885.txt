crossover recombination sexual reproduction binary operator gas called crossover creates children parents 
crossover rate prescribes probability selected pair parents mate crossover applied 
crossover applied 
interpretation analogous gas bit representation 
basic crossover mechanisms point crossover uniform crossover 
point crossover cuts parents length segments randomly chosen crossover points points parents creates child gluing odd segments father segments mother 
child odd segments come mother segments come father 
majority ga applications point crossover point crossover higher applied seldomly 
uniform crossover decides bit insert bit value father mother child child created opposite decisions 
order representation requires individual permutation 
applying point uniform crossover permutations may create children containing multiple occurrences genes children permutations necessarily permutations 
fact led design special order crossovers preserve property permutation 
example order crossover ox resembles point crossover 
ox cuts parents segments randomly chosen crossover points 
child inherits middle segment parent modification 
remaining positions filled genes parent order appear skipping genes child child created analogously reversing parents roles 
clearly tree representation gp requires special crossover operators 
standard gp crossover works randomly chosing node parent parent independently 
nodes define subtree parent crossover exchanges subtrees
