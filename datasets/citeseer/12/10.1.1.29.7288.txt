violent swings inferences changes measured large constitute complexity 
complex systems turning formal definitions self dissimilarity speculate self dissimilarity important indicator complexity 
certainly self dissimilar systems interesting coincide commonly considered complex systems 
systems commonly viewed complex interesting constructed evolutionary process life culture intelligence 
assume selective advantage systems maximizing amount information processing system volume led consider systems able process information different ways spatio temporal scales different processes communicating 
exploiting different scales run different information processing systems certain sense maximally dense respect information processing achieve volume 
systems processing information similarly different scales worse exploiting different scales simply inefficient information processing capabilities 
maximal different information processes different scales presumably efficient communication processes 
communication common systems usually viewed complex 
example typically effects large scale occurrences broken bones organisms propagate smallest levels stimulating bone cell growth complex systems 
similarly slight changes small scales bankruptcy firm mutation gene marked large scale industry wide body wide effects 
despite clear potential benefits multi scale information processing explicitly constructing system engages behavior formidable challenge 
specifying necessary dynamical conditions hamiltonian system able support multi scale information processing appears difficult 
difficult explicitly construct physical system engages researchers consider life behavior engages intelligent behavior hypothesis coincidence reflects fact systems engage multi scale information processing 
try construct systems engage multi scale information processing merely assume nature ways

generally self dissimilarity signatures compare entirely different kinds systems information densities human organizations versus mass distributions galaxies 
complexity measure theory meaningfully address questions modern economy complexity signature compare inside cell 
naturally occurring ecology modern city

fact applying statistical technique clustering self dissimilarity signatures able create empirically defined taxonomies ranging broad classes real world systems 
example self dissimilarity signatures certainly separate marine environments mass density organisms similar mass density environment terrestrial environments mass densities organisms quite different environment 
hope signatures divide marine creatures terrestrial ones bodily processes marine creatures observe broad commonalities terrestrial creatures vice versa 
certainly expect signatures separate eukaryotes plants animals short statistical clustering self dissimilarity signatures may provide purely datadriven model driven worse subjective means generating biological taxonomy 
extend set signatures clustered far biological systems creating theory taxonomy natural phenomena 
example cluster cultural institutions eastern western socio economic institutions break distinct clusters cluster signatures institutions insect colonies fall cluster human feudal societies
