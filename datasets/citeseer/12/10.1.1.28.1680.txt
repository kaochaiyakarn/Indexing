workflow technology emerged appropriate platform consolidating distributed information resources enterprise promoting interoperability cross platform systems providing global view understanding business process models 
business processes workflows represent dynamic nature encounter frequent unavoidable changes 
dynamism organizations maintain competitive edge 
workflow technology date provide sufficient support dynamically changing processes 
managing schema change workflow processes multiple active instances complex issue 
analysis workflow changes relation business process change classification workflow changes dictate scope problem 
classification lay foundation generic framework support dynamically changing workflow processes 

business environments exceedingly dynamic competitive times 
technological advancements possible organizations automate business processes extensively 
specialized information systems emerged tailored specific functional divisions organizations 
time giant leaps connectivity owing advancement communication infrastructure protocols 
organizations seek achieve higher goals consolidating specialized distributed disconnected resources 
workflow technology provides appropriate platform consolidating distributed information resources enterprise providing global view understanding business process models 
business process model description organization activities terms tasks agents rules procedures 
engineered fulfill business goal 
workflow defined automation business process part documents information tasks passed participant action set procedural rules 
workflows bring tasks agents rules procedures business process 
workflow management means ordering coordination allocation tasks defined controlled accordance usually set rules procedures 
agents called processing entities responsible performing tasks humans information systems 
workflow main components process model process model workflow model definition tasks ordering data resources aspects process 
represents workflow schema type 
workflow models defined graphs depict flow ordering tasks involved process description task properties 
example define admission workflow handles student admission applications university 
process instance process instance particular occurrence process example particular application admission represents instance admission workflow 
different instances workflow may perform different subset workflow tasks may different execution paths workflow graph 
instance class set instances represented execution subgraph 
exception handling active area research information systems issue attracted interest workflow research groups owing necessity 
earliest contributions came 
divide exceptions may occur workflow execution basic failures failures system level application failures expected exceptions unexpected exceptions

abort active workflow instances may aborted process model changed 
abort commonly adaptation individual instances example canceling reservation 
abort may incur losses organization cases losses may unacceptable 
cases abort require compensation accomplished far 
migrate change effects current instances may introduced allowing instances abort flush 
current instances normally different stages process execution

briefly introduce workflow modeling language 
conforms closely workflow management coalition standards 
gives example immigration workflow handles immigration visa applications 
workflow directed acyclic graph dag finite set nodes flow relation nat set natural numbers nat number incoming flows node nat number outgoing flows node set condition nodes set task nodes call initial node call final node task workflow described set properties

elaborate task properties 
task complex object rich semantics considered mere node workflow graph 
node workflow execution structure consisting set visible states set transitions states 

execution nodes modeled finite state machine
