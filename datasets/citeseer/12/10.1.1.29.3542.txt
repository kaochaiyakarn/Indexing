key elements project centered tasks information extraction retrieval 
outlined interface integrates described 
terminology identification classification discussions domain experts identified classes useful entities names proteins genes 
reliable identification acquisition class members key goals terminology databases automatically extended 
underestimate difficulty task naming conventions field loose 
initial experiments shallow parser voutilainen identify noun phrases classify proteins cooccurrence set verbs 
due difficulties caused inconsistent naming terms decided multiple sources evidence classifying terminology 
currently extended approach exploring models named entity recognition 
statistical model word clustering baker mccallum trained pre classified word lists swissprot databases 
supplemented short word lists identify class term final noun existed head final position 
experiments judgement set expert tagged medline abstracts model yielded scores pre identified phrases follows source entities proteins rna dna 
expect improve addition better training word lists 
second approach decision trees quinlan supplemented word lists classes derived swissprot databases 
tests phrases terms pre identified 
model trained corpus expert tagged medline abstracts tested corpus articles yielding scores source protein entities 
number rna dna entities small train 
part project creating expert tagged corpus medline abstracts full papers training testing tools 
markup scheme corpus developed cooperation groups biologists conceptual domain model implemented sgml

information extraction information extraction methods automatically extract named entity properties events domain specific concepts medline abstracts full texts 
part construction maintenance ontology domain executed system developing called ontology extraction system oems 
oems extracts types information domain ontology ogata called typing information abstracts taxonomy subtype structure mereology part structure synonymy identity structure 
eventually hope able identify extract domain specific facts protein protein binding information full texts aid formation cell signalling diagrams necessary 
thesaurus building goal construct thesaurus automatically medline abstracts domain dictionaries consisting medical domain terms purpose query expansion information retrieval databases medline see jing croft 
currently working med test set queries documents smart see salton buckley 
eventually plan building specialised thesaurus genome domain currently depends creation suitable test set 
interface key aspect project providing easy interaction domain experts information extraction programs 
interface provides link information extraction programs clickable links aid querying related information publically available databases www single environment
