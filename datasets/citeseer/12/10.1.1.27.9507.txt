distance model years ago waldo postulated called law geography related closer things closely related 
geographers geospatial scientists premise

mercator projection preserves angular relationships making preferred choice navigation purposes

peters projection aims preserving relative area sizes

dealing visualization high dimensional information spaces similarly difficult choice different projection techniques respective parameters

areas visualization struggle issue different terms employed level detail lod notion context virtual environments 
cartographic generalization deeply connected concept scale traditionally defined ratio size feature map size real world 
variety reasons digital age required cartography related fields rethink notion scale 
resolution granularity stand modern notions scale especially context remotely sensed raster imagery 
solutions shown question arises inherently appropriate scales generalized solutions shown 
existing cartographic expertise may provide starting point 
cartographic generalization notoriously difficult automate due large degree subjectivity involved

feature labeling dimensional information visualization cartographic representations feature labeling problematic number reasons 
text labels tend occupy relatively large portions display area contribute greatly problem graphic complexity 
case point features labels take map space symbols refer 
generalization procedures consideration text labels reducing number displayed features labeling subset features 
case labeling integrated generalization routine 
second visualization procedures decisions choice label positions 
especially problematic dimensional displays containing dense feature clusters 
conflicts inevitable large numbers closely neighboring features individually labeled 
problem related generalization issue way addressing reduce number labeled features 
hand may want search optimized positions labels legible clearly associated map features 
developed number principal rules regarding label placement 
significant body cartographic research devoted subject 
studies prescribe preferred label positions cartographic experience 
article influential 
describing hierarchy point feature label positions discusses treatment area line features 
researchers attempted verify label position preferences analyzing labeling solutions existing maps quantifiable manner 
existing cartographic labeling rules reasonably learned applied human automation non trivial task 
dominant approaches distinguished 
employment expert system techniques 
approach views labeling combinatorial optimization problem 
areas cartographic problem great interest broader graphics community 
example christensen reports implementation various optimization routines 
sophisticated automated labeling routines starting implemented cartographic packages varying success 
areas outside cartography feature labeling problem 
example psychometric studies confronted dealing results multidimensional scaling procedures 
third choice label terms information space units challenging 
case vectorspace models unproblematic single terms visualized 
similar labeling geographic place names settlements label terms typically correspond real world names features 
hand documents visualized choice label terms difficult 
weighted ranking keywords help automate process 
principle extended label clusters documents computationally extract cluster labels shown figures 
feature labels information visualization requires recognition interrelations aspects 
furthermore may various relationships especially complex visualization 
cartographic labeling aims prevention labeling conflicts occur labels feature class labels different feature classes labels features 
generalization issue utilize labels convey geographic locations distributions various levels 
example labels towns cities map africa allow casual map reader draw history clusters french names clusters english names portuguese names 
maps consider geographic reality label placement 
names coastal cities supposed placed completely inside water area cities located near coast supposed labeled inside land area 
cases place shape labels may substitute direct representation feature geometry line area features 
done features species habitats sub oceanic ridges 
important thing remember text labels complex map information visualizations labels merely serve fixed identifiers map symbols 
addition role serve counterparts map elements overlapping content spatial domains echoing iconic properties 
recognition complicated relationship iconic linguistic codes help evaluation information visualizations 
example ask continuous visualization appropriate associated text labels suggest meaning restricted ridges valleys pits remain labels 
especially useful investigation meaning information visualization efforts cartography outline theoretical framework map design map maceachren maps 

map design value maps largely stems successful marriage utilitarian components 
process known map design raw geographic data turned visual representations attractive useful 
necessarily involves degree subjectivity number widely accepted map design principles 
visualization non geographic information 
case point graphic variables encode quantitative qualitative data variables 
example size graphic variable restricted quantitative data variations symbol shape encode qualitative data 
formalized jacques bertin principles recognized root information visualization investigated graphics community various contexts 
tufte particularly contributed cartographic ideas turning quantitative data visualizations 
numerous graphic examples fact depict geographic space 
establishment visual hierarchies intelligent symbol choices important aspect map design 
illustrates administrative divisions geographic space 
note inherent hierarchy mapped features supported visually 
higher level area objects delineated thicker lines labeled larger font size 
color labels supports association labels respective area features 
similarly create visualizations non geographic information multiple levels hierarchical classification simultaneously displayed 
portion visualization newspaper articles shown levels hierarchical clustering tree projected dimensional base map 
visual hierarchies express multi level classifications restricted hierarchical classifications 
example simultaneously display means clustering solutions varying number clusters 
color effective tools convey meaning graphic representations natural focus attention broader graphics community time 
brewer provides set guidelines color encoding quantitative qualitative information cartographic purposes 
guidelines provide starting point dimensional visualization information 
example visualization quantitative information single som layers 
applied vector space model layers contain information variations influence individual terms different parts map 
common information visualization packages employ full spectral color scheme convey quantitative differences 
traditional view differences hue appropriate encoding qualitative variables 
addition full spectral scheme especially problematic due position bright saturated yellow center schemes
