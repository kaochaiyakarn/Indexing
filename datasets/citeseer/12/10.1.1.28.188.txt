search engine able provide reasons selecting rejecting document 
representations satisfy clustering requirement people interests similar similar representations 
necessary exploration slightly modifying pro le required result commensurate change documents selected 
genetic algorithm genetic algorithm promises interesting approach modeling adaptive ltering systems 
ga approach fully exploited due time constraints 
directions relating gas information ltering 
area research automating application genetic operators user actions 
user starts providing negative feedback increasing frequency newer generations may speed adaptation 
ga system involves number parameters retention rate mutation rate automatically modi ed user behavior 
example user consistently provides positive feedback documents retrieved increase 
interesting problem maintain diversity population preventing pro les getting close 
di erent pro les ideally cover nonoverlapping regions information space 
calculating proximity pro les vector space representation easy 
interesting problem devise scheme applies selective pressure neighbouring pro les move away 
economic model optimizing computational resources possibly provide solution 
users typically special needs integrated ga model 
example user create special high priority pro le eliminated population matter 
users want pro le eliminated gets explicit negative feedback 
ga model described thesis extended special members population handled special way 
issues need addressed 
agent model agent behavior biggest obstacle users accepting agent systems 
critically important user develops understanding agent behavior 
area creating tools help users develop satisfactory agent models 
approaches solving problem 
internal state agent accessible comprehensible user 
second agent able provide meaningful explanations actions 
needs done providing users better view internal state agent 
way facilitate allow better views interfaces 
instance consider situation arose testing system real users 
user wanted see list newsgroups searched pro le separately times user liked see newsgroups searched entire population pro les 
user needed di erent views internal state 
implementations user allowed experiment scenarios 
example user want kinds articles retrieved extra keyword added pro le 
second method enhancing understanding agent explanations agent behavior 
current implementation information stored scoring process done nal score document 
alternative instance remember terms contributed document score 
reasonable explanation available justify document selected 
interfaces provided user query action agent 
user interface user interface interesting area research 
amount user interaction required reduced intelligent interfaces 
smart badges user modeling detect physical location user 
possible application ltering system automatically assume positive feedback user spends long time front computer document displayed 
lessen burden interaction user 
interface take advantage multiple media 
example users textual news hear re driving view involves video 
interesting problem design intelligent agent communicate multiple media er user seamless navigation media
