remainder information items list 
provide brief description sctp features multi homing increased security 
data concerning benefit providing multiple streams partial order delivery 
sctp multihoming features machines multiple ip addresses 
routers necessity systems route packets multiple ip addresses 
example hosts provide mission critical services provide multiple ip addresses redundant protection single points failure 
tcp connection defined tuple remote ip address remote port local port local ip address suppose system local ip addresses tcp connection established remote system local ip address connectivity lost address tcp connection aborted reestablished tcp provides capability migrate established connection ip address 
tcp connection sub optimal 
transparent failover lost application involved 
term stream sctp refer sequence user messages delivered upper layer protocol order respect messages stream 
contrast usage tcp refers sequence bytes 

connection setup adds cost round trip time 

reestablished connection slow start 

data buffered receiver need discarded retransmitted 
contrast sctp allows transport layer connection association sctp terminology defined set local ip addresses set remote ip addresses 
heartbeat packets form ping monitor connectivity local host remote ip addresses 
connectivity lost primary ip address association association seamlessly fail alternate ip address 
sctp associations potential useful systems battlefield networks system mobile command center provides mission critical service may require seamless failover multiple network attachments satellite wireless lan wired lan 
sctp mobility features battlefield networks may highly mobile systems ip address continuously changing 
situations sctp offers alternative mobile ip solutions require ip ip encapsulation forwarding home agents 
mentioned section sctp allows associations defined sets local remote ip addresses 
feature addition extension dynamically adding deleting ip addresses sets allow mobile systems hand smoothly transparently 
time host moves new subnet obtains new ip addresses add new ip address set delete old 
transport layer activities remain application gets disrupted 
resistance attacks tcp sctp provide connection oriented data delivery tcp connection establishment process particularly vulnerable denial service attacks 
tcp connection establishment data transmitted tcp hosts establish connection way handshake 
initiator connection sends syn packet 

passive connection allocates resources dedicated connection replies syn ack 

initiator acknowledges syn ack acknowledgment 
tcp implementations limit number connections syn rcvd state connections passive host received syn allocated resources replied syn ack received final ack way handshake 
attacking system send series syn packets usually forged ip addresses victim reached limit half open connections leaving unable accept new incoming connections 
half open connections purged period time attacker send syns faster timeout period little cost 
form attack known syn flooding widely accepted defense implemented entirely tcp 
glance may raising eliminating limit half open connections help exacerbates problem 
attacker send syns eliminating limit render victim unable receive new incoming connections exhaust supply memory 
internet security attack rests solely internet service providers willingness restrict outgoing ip packets forged source addresses 
working isps filter forged packets may practical partial solution internet battlefield network enemy may means forge packets alternative solution needed 
sctp defense way handshake sctp association setup incorporates exchange message authentication code mac generated passive host cryptographic hash algorithm 
passive host commit resources association mac exchanged target system vulnerable denial service attacks spoofed addresses 
additionally mac helps prevent replay attacks 
example typical sctp association establishment active host attempts connect passive host 
resources connection sends init packet 

replies init ack containing cookie comprised transmission control block state setup new connection established time cookie generated 
time cookie expires 
mac implementation depen dent private key hash algorithm 

sends cookie echo chunk containing copy cookie sent init ack optionally piggybacks user data 

cookie echo contains valid cookie resources association sends cookie ack optionally piggybacked user data 
cookie invalid discards packet 
example sent init spurious ip address sent init ack spurious address 
saved state allocated resources association received valid mac ability perform denial ofservice attack curtailed 
traditionally macs separate parties share private key 
sctp ensure state cookie echoed back passive host forged 
generates mac secure hash function private key impossible send counterfeit mac accept break encryption scheme 
result sctp offers enhanced protection replay denial service attacks 
current sctp implementations md sctp specification endorse particular secure hash algorithm 
allows protocol implementors strongest efficient algorithms disposal 
fact hash generated verified host passive host eliminates problems associated interoperability 
event particular algorithm cryptographically insecure may replaced new minimal effort 
similarly sctp implementations military encryption may seamlessly integrate military civilian sctp implementations weakening security
