summarization transcripts produced manually recognizer output wish produce condensed informative summaries meetings 
attempting detailed linguistic analysis semantics meeting adopt statistical approach flag select salient relevant informative passages meeting meeting varying detail 
experiments attempt quantify quality compression achieved approach 
metric selecting salient informative passages human dialog explored maximal marginal relevance mmr metric introduced text summarization tipster project carbonell 
mmr iteratively maximizes similarity query section document minimizes similarity previously ranked document sections 
identifies relevant diverse non redundant sections document 
apply modified version mmr conversational dialogue find relevant non redundant turns meeting transcript 
top turns user original order meeting transcript summary meeting 
experiments created summaries dialogues switchboard collection set person conversations 
demonstrate resulting segments provide brief summary gist meeting 
mmr requires query necessary generate query center summary 
previous modifications mmr create generic summaries submitting common words document combination document title query 
case chosen common word query 
plan explore top common words phrases query generate improved generic summary 
summarization algorithm summarization algorithm takes input textual transcript generated manually actual speech recognition run 
produces summary consisting turns utterances 
algorithm divided steps 
eliminate words consideration

weight turn utterance 
include highest weighted turn summary 
eliminate common stem words included turn consideration 
preset summary size reached go step 
step set words consisting common words spoken english language eliminate uninformative words dialogue focus topical substance 
mark stopwords uninteresting essentially consideration 
goal second step identify set remaining words common word stem 
technique similar noun phrase summaries 
algorithms noun phrase summaries generate lists words phrases appear document ordered number times phrase appears 
purpose provide reader gist document presenting common words 
provide ordered list words counting occurrence word non zero weight 
save time words limited noun phrases 
complete implementation count phrases individual words 
contention word highest weight unique important 
believe finding common stem provides indication important remaining topic document 
simplification considering letters word significant 
technique proven successful compromise place better stemming algorithms 
common stem identified third step turn previously included summary weighted 
count number occurrences common word stem turn
