integrating working learning document enrichment approach paul zdrahal john domingue marek knowledge media institute open university milton keynes mk aa uk kmi open ac uk zdrahal domingue open ac uk fax integrating working learning seen desirable alternative traditional training regimes 
integrated approach working learning gradual contextual problem oriented cost effective 
knowledge technology aims workplace learning requires right organisational culture brings additional costs regarding articulation representation transmission knowledge 
approach reduces costs making articulation natural part collaborative working designing informal formal knowledge facilitating transition socially situated knowledge enriched documents 
successful approach certain concerning organisational culture nature shared documents organisational knowledge activities 
companies workers need adapt changing demands 
traditional top approach problem identify skills gap need current competencies staff 
gap bridged conventional training methods extend staff competencies meet requirements 
model number shortcomings 
training shown ineffective 
reported training transferred job wasting year 
believed due training occurring outside normal context difficult transfer 
second approach leads stress employees skills developed intermittently abruptly rd 
third process solely top senior personnel identify needs done role workers play determining development 
recognized potential harness support learning naturally occurs colleagues workplace 
process termed organisational learning involves workers learning sharing ideas normal part social collaborative nature activities 
appears beneficial process compared conventional training responsive immediate needs driven problems occurring workplace gradual ongoing conducted context
