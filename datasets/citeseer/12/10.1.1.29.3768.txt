behaviour learning agent message engine user position information obtained gps system 
latitude longitude coordinates received behaviour learning agent translated virtual location home defined 
gps data stored agent analyzed recognize locations 
feature eliminates need users fill extensive forms provide data system 
salient location identified commotion informs user prompts assign virtual location string tag home grocery store 
user required tag location immediately done time identifying mark map 
new location assigned corresponding list 
lists specific shared 
example grocery stores typically share list 
lists contain text audio data edited number ways full text editing graphical user interface mobile client audio entries client user interface text entries regular email system 
reminders messages specifically assigned virtual location

interaction system done graphical user interface speech commands 
user define receive data arriving leaving specific location minutes 
additionally time user view map current location neighbourhood locales banks movie grocery stores user privacy issues system monitors mobility user raises privacy issues 
common reaction big brother watching 
user privacy taken account 
gps tracking behaviour learning agent monitoring done client side solely accessible client 
mobile user moves virtual location server updated current position order retrieve relevant messages

query engine module permits query location commotion mobile user 
order prevent feeling little brothers monitoring authorization assigned virtual location 
user queried commotion client regular email system 
query request goes server specific client 
request sent authorized person receive location information example user way home 
queried unauthorized response user 
case queried user log location information requested 
commotion progress
