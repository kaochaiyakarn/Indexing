propose certain situations possible precisely quantify notions modeling value private information 
give simplified stylized examples value information supplied individuals transaction evaluated quite accurately fair compensation fact ways act incentives individuals truthfully participate transaction 
examples treat transaction coalitional game consider core shapley value examples fair allocation principles 
consider cases information collected single monolithic enterprise cases information pooled distributed fashion 
example instance scenario marketing survey individuals announce preferences possible products catalogs services exactly product adopted 
vendor payo increases size majority supporting outcome individual wants preference adopted 
example show imputations core favor participants majority surprisingly general shapley value cases close vote known happen real life 
clear majority preferences individuals shapley value confers vanishingly small quantity individuals outside majority 
quite di erent setting recommendation system 
single vendor individuals pool knowledge interesting items goal learning new items collective knowledge base 
predictably shapley value game rewards novel contributions core empty uninteresting case disjoint contributions 
consider extension collaborative filtering situation agents take recommendations items know 
examples marketing survey consider vendor conducting survey consumers regarding preferences possible versions planned product 
assume consumer single clear preference alternatives advantage preferred alternative adopted 
case multiple votes allowed top winners adopted handled analysis completely parallel follows 
vendor decides adopt alternative attracts votes simplicity say lower indexed item wins case ties 
payo vendor equal size majority presumably represents size market item consumer winning majority gets payo consumers get payo zero 
formulate coalitional game consider agents consumers 
vendor named payo coalition subset set agents determined situation restricted subset contains vendor payo twice size majority preferences consumers contain vendor zero

important solution concept shapley value

mathematically imputation 
sn denoting set agents arrival order arrived shapley value shown notion fairness compatible natural controversial axioms see 
settings shapley value despite complicated appearance represented simple closed form expression

follows assume number consumers grows number alternatives fixed grows slowly 
divide customers categories 
corresponding subset voting single alternative suppose indexed 
denote size largest category majority denote sizes remaining categories 
constant say clear majority margin majority largest minority categories di er votes 
claim proposition shapley value vendor satisfies constant clear majority margin consumers majority category payo consumers outside majority category payo vendor payo

sketch proof proposition 
see observe expected number members arriving vendor precisely point vendor arrival payo increases expected value suppose clear majority margin particular implies 
permutation agents denote set agents arriving positions 
say permutation largest category subset hoe ding bounds constant depending random permutation log holds high probability 
similarly log high probability 
union bound log fact follows random permutation log high probability 
consider customer random permutation 
consider event log log arguments holds high probability

conditioned event contribution payo conditioned contribution cases 
combining contribution permutations hold interesting notice absence certainty preference majority consumer incentive participate survey shapley value symmetric payo core exception proceeds go vendor 
recommendation systems consider recommendation system individuals pool information interesting items books see theoretical recommendation systems 
suppose individual likes items benefits finding 
simple model agent identified set items knows 
payo coalition 
total benefit coalition total number items collectively known members

shapley value agent words agent payo shapley value naturally total novelty items agent contributes novelty item inversely proportional number agents know 
collaborative filtering introduce somewhat sophisticated model preferences ways participants benefit announcement preferences suppose preferences form matrix entry ij agent likes item agent item agent know item 
setting motivated formalizing classic ideas collaborative filtering see instance
