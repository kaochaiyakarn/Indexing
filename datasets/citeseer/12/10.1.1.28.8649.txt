bayesian inference statistical inference consists establishing model process world drawing parameters non observed variables model set observations resulting process 
bayesian inference considers model parameters non observed random variables allows encourages knowledge process establish prior probabilities parameters favor configurations model priori 
computationally set random variables allows infer impact set variables interest ae observation non overlapping set variables ae model ability compute account prior beliefs impact 
order carry computations efficiently underlying model usually mapped graph inferences achieved belief propagation adjacent nodes 
graphs known graphical models bayesian networks belief networks encompass popular solutions difficult image processing problems including kalman filters hidden markov models markov random fields mixture models 
specifically bayesian network set variables fx xn probabilistic model composed graph set local probabilistic relations graph consists set nodes node corresponding variables set links edges link expressing probabilistic relationship variables nodes connects 
state node observed marginal probabilities states remaining nodes updated efficient algorithms require message passing neighboring nodes structure junction tree derived graph

semantic user interaction show experimental evidence fact semantic characterization achieved rates high real movie databases 
section illustrate large potential user interaction inherent type characterization considering tasks video summarization browsing 

video summarization system capable inferring content semantics summarization simple outcome characterization process 
system user understand language required system display inferred semantic attributes way overwhelm user 
user cognitive resources extrapolate semantic attributes attributes usually higher semantic level may required coarse understanding content 

semantic time lines graphical summarization attained form time line displays evolution state semantic attributes movie 
presents time lines resulting analysis promotional trailers movies circle friends cof river wild trw 
line time line corresponds semantic attribute identified letter left margin action close crowd natural set interval small tick marks displays state attribute shot trailer filled empty intervals mean attribute active 
shots represented order appear trailer 
simply looking time lines user quickly extract significant amount information content movies 
understand right away cof contains action scenes consists dialogue semantic time lines trailers movies circle friends top river wild bottom 
part shot man sets trw action contains dialogue shot wilderness

fact believe written summary movies people doubts establishing correspondence summaries movies information provided semantic time lines 
verify consider summaries provided movies internet movie database circle friends story lives loves irish girls eve nan go trinity college dublin

river wild gail expert white water takes family trip river family house

family finds pair men armed 
men physically force family take river meet 
trip family definitely importantly lives stake 
currently designing experiments human subjects allow achieve objective assessment benefits semantic summarization 

semantic content access browsing obviously argued example fully stretch capabilities semantic characterization movies belong different genres semantic characterizations allow smart user find desired movie

semantic characterization help 
answers question 
characterization fine distinguish trw 
solution augment system finer semantic attributes subdivide natural set attribute classes river forest desert second significantly simpler say simply looking time lines help interacting 
consider action scenes movies 
trw expect see river woman bad guys expect see lions hunters 
action scenes probably place look 
consider trw time line bottom 
key frames shots high area time line bottom 
shot correctly classified containing action depicts promotional message included 
high concentration action shots highlighted area indicates best area look action

viewing shots represented clear action occurs river bad guys third shots depict fight woman child boat 
information contained completely disambiguate content semantic attributes provide way quickly access relevant portions video stream
