discussion factored probabilistic model citations described advantages disadvantages respect traditional linear factorization 
important advantage probabilities estimates provides clear interpretation traditional model provides scalar magnitudes authority model estimates actual probabilities 
probabilities wellunderstood semantics may combined manipulated provide answers quantitative bibliometric questions 
subjectively authorities extracted probabilistic model correspond better human intuition extracted pca hits model 
citation data robustly recovers established categories better pca 
web links recovers intuitive communities frequently mixes representation 
part difference may due mismatch statistical model factor may citations intentional web links www microsoft com appears uniformly authoritative topics web pages carry linked banner page best viewed internet explorer 
aside enforcing factor orthogonality means weighting authority page relevance determined word content alleviate spurious associations 
see section current area 
unintended mixing communities minor disadvantages current probabilistic model subject research 
eigenvector model derived pca em training guaranteed identify globally optimal factoring 
performance em procedure dependent starting point optimization may get stuck local optima poor performance 
empirically observe variation factors corresponding authorities runs primary trends fairly constant 
observed noticeably bad fits experiments guarantee re missing perfect global fit 
performing multiple restarts fitting procedure little done address shortcoming 
interesting possibility computing pca model factors seed probabilistic model 
shortcoming probabilistic model implementation decide priori number factors model 
pca permits extracting successive factors iteratively observing magnitude 
looking magnitude extracted factors called test estimate significant factors extracted 
roughly may accomplished probabilistic model process trades computational expense risk getting stuck local maxima 
factored probabilistic model select factor split 
re fit resulting increase model likelihood examined 
model selection criterion aic akaike bic schwarz determine increase likelihood justifies split 
split kept factor selected splitting process repeated 
danger hierarchical techniques early split appears optimal may eventually lead suboptimal splits 
automatically identifying right number factors learning hierarchy increasingly specific factors extensions exploring 
computationally approaches comparable 
running matlab sparse matrix routines pentium iii hits required approximately seconds compute factors 
machine required seconds compute factors seconds compute factors 
final advantage probabilistic factored model traditional provides foundation building unified probabilistic model content connections linked documents 
hofmann plsi hofmann performs way term document factoring :10.1.1.1.4458
model performs way document citation factoring
