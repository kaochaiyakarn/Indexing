ontological query language content image retrieval labs cambridge technical report chris town david sinclair laboratories cambridge street cambridge cb qa england discusses design implementation query language content image retrieval 
retrieval process takes place entirely ontological domain de ned syntax semantics user query 
system rely pre annotation images sentences language format text queries highly exible 
language extensible allow de nition higher level terms cars people buildings basis existing language constructs 
images retrieved deriving syntax tree textual user query probabilistically evaluating comparing composition perceptual properties salient image regions light query 
matching process utilises automatically extracted image segmentation classi cation information incorporate feature detection mechanisms face recognisers context dependent knowledge available time query processed 
powerful easy textual document retrieval systems pervasive constitute major driving forces internet 
people familiar simple keyword strings retrieve documents vast online collections natural extend language querying multimedia data 
content image retrieval cbir basis short query sentences prove ecient intuitive alternative query composition schemes iterative search example user sketches employed current systems 
comparatively small number query languages designed cbir largely failed attain standards necessary general adoption 
major reason fact language text image retrieval systems rely manual annotations captions document context pre generated keywords leads loss exibility initial choice annotation indexing 
languages mainly concerned deriving textual descriptions image content inappropriate general purpose retrieval infeasible generate exhaustive textual representations contain information levels detail required process query 
formal query languages extensions sql limited expressive power extensibility require certain level user experience sophistication 
orts rely pre computation object relational graph structures computationally expensive may require complex queries yield expected results 
order address challenges mentioned keeping user search overheads minimum developed query description language

tokens serving adjectives denoting desired image properties parameterised enable values ranges speci ed 
defaults terms representing fuzzy value sets simple rules operator precedence associativity help reduce ective complexity query sentences limit need special syntax brackets disambiguate grouping
