appears working notes ijcai workshop abduction induction ai pp integrating abduction induction machine learning raymond mooney department computer sciences university texas austin tx usa mooney cs utexas edu discusses integration traditional abductive inductive reasoning methods development machine learning systems 
particular discusses areas traditional abductive methods propose revisions theory refinement existing knowledge base modified consistent set empirical data inductive learning methods automatically acquire examples diagnostic knowledge base abductive reasoning 
abduction process inferring cause effect constructing explanations observed events required tasks diagnosis plan recognition 
induction process inferring general rules specific data primary task machine learning 
important issue reasoning processes integrated abduction aid machine learning machine learning acquire abductive theories 
research group explored issues development machine learning systems years 
particular developed methods abduction identify faults suggest repairs theory refinement inducing rule bases abductive diagnosis 
treat induction abduction distinct reasoning tasks demonstrated direct service developing ai systems solving real world problems 
briefly review areas focusing issue abduction induction integrated 
abduction induction precise definitions abduction induction somewhat controversial 
order concrete generally assume abduction induction defined general logical manner 
ffl background knowledge observations data represented sets formulae order predicate calculus restricted ground formulae 
ffl find hypothesis set logical formulae abduction generally restricted set atomic ground existentially quantified formulae called assumptions generally quite large relative hand induction generally consists universally quantified horn clauses called theory knowledge base relatively small may empty 
cases occam razor preferred kept small simple possible 
despite limitations formal definitions encompass significant fraction existing re additional details available publications listed bibliography available postscript world wide web www cs utexas edu users ml 
search abduction induction syntactic constraints capture intuitive distinctions reasoning methods 
abduction hypothesis specific set assumptions explain observations particular case induction hypothesis general theory explains observations number cases 
body logical abduction poole levesque ng mooney kakas generally fits definition abduction diagnostic models reiter peng reggia shown equivalent special case poole ng inductive logic programming ilp muggleton lavrac dzeroski employs definition induction machine learning induction seen fitting paradigm michalski intent current debate philosophical advantages disadvantages definitions induction abduction believe debate eventually just question terminology 
acceptance fairly large body researchers areas range specific algorithms systems developed performing abductive inductive reasoning prescribed definitions 
claim current existing methods fruitfully integrated develop machine learning systems effectiveness experimentally demonstrated realistic applications 
abduction theory refinement theory refinement theory revision knowledge base refinement machine learning task modifying existing imperfect domain theory consistent set data 
logical theories precisely defined follows ffl initial theory set positive examples set negative examples restricted ground formulae 
ffl find minimally revised consistent theory generally examples ground horn clauses form bn body gives description case head gives classification logically follow description follow case negative example 
revising logical theory may require adding removing clauses adding removing literals existing clauses 
generally ideal goal minimal syntactic change existing theory pazzani mooney unfortunately task computationally intractable practice heuristic search methods approximate minimal syntactic change 
note compared background knowledge induction theory refinement requires modifying existing background knowledge just adding clauses 
experimental results number realistic applications demonstrated revising existing imperfect knowledge base provided expert results accurate results inducing knowledge base scratch ourston mooney towell shavlik theory refinement systems abduction individual examples locate faults theory suggest repairs ourston mooney ourston ourston mooney pazzani mooney mooney brunk systems abduction slightly different way discussion summarizes basic approach 
individual positive example derivable current theory abduction applied determine set assumptions allow proved 
assumptions suggestions modifying theory 
potential repair learn new rule assumed proposition inferred known facts example 
potential repair remove assumed proposition list antecedents rule appears abductive explanation example 
example consider theory 

unprovable positive example 
abduction find assumption positive example provable 
possible revisions theory remove literal second clause theory learn new clause 
possible abductive assumption suggesting possible revisions removing clause learning new clause 

order find small set repairs allow positive examples proved greedy set covering algorithm select small subset union repair points suggested abductive explanations individual positive examples resulting subset covers positive examples 
simply deleting literals clause causes negative examples covered inductive methods ilp techniques foil quinlan learn new clause consistent negative examples 
continuing example assume positive examples 

negative examples 

abductive assumptions generated second positive examples respectively 
making repair predicate cover cases 
note previously mentioned potential repairs cover second example abductive assumption sufficient assumed 
repair single predicate covers positive examples chosen 
deleting antecedent clause original theory allow negative examples proven 
new clause needed 
positive examples required abductive assumptions 
negative examples assumptions allow negative examples derived 
descriptions provided examples ilp system foil induce new clause 
simplest clause covers positive examples covering negatives 
note alternative equally simple clause covers positive examples covers negative example 
ourston mooney ourston mooney theory refinement systems allow multiple assumptions order prove example preferring specific assumptions employ specific abduction cox ii pazzani brunk series theory refinement systems single fault assumption abduction 
positive example find single specific assumption example provable 
different constraints abduction may result different repairs chosen effecting level specificity theory refined
