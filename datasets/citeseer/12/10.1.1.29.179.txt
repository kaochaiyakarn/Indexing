state space multiagent problems exponential 
proposed representation circumvents problem low order relationships agents probabilistically recognize collaboration observing coordination 
representation allowing minor variation individual actions take place observing major temporal changes actions 
major changes encoded moderately sized network 
example multiagent representation uses temporal analysis functions condense information entire observation interval single evidence detector incorporated multiagent network 
feature space size 
size feature space large features importance relate object trajectories 
deictic features visual networks limits feature computation significantly 
agent centered features reasonable agent goal action behavior recognized analyzing agent interactions locally space time 
feature space size controlled hierarchically recognized agent goals input features recognition multiagent action 
football domain agent usually goals play 
representing time 
representation time simply set relationships intervals 
interval boundaries fuzzy determined likelihood curves 
temporal representation weak propagating temporal contraints reasoning temporal activity 
representation adequate recognizing temporal behavior 
scalability classes 
algorithm scale number multiagent actions differentiated 
current algorithm suffer actions differentiated small subset motions 
example plays identical motion player may temporal relationships differentiating motion noise relations small variations agent behavior may prevent correct play selected 
algorithm fails scale actions require intentional differentiation introduced 
example plays identical play primary receiver play intille bobick primary receiver thinking process led change receivers represented primary covered ll throw 
system need infer logic detecting player covered unavailable receive pass subtle distinction football weight cost throwing secondary player sufficiently covered 
representational uncertainty 
visual networks multiagent networks adequately encode uncertainty noisy trajectory data 
multiagent networks softly weight components making representation robust small variations observed multiagent action 
encoding domain rules 
temporal structure descriptions easy encode 
components descriptions visual networks difficult knowledge engineering challenges 
experience encoding rules project suggests rule systems problematic extend due hidden dependencies rules bayesian networks difficult time consuming design 
rule system problem rule dependency appear solved bayesian networks system possible construct multiple network modularity required violates independence assumptions 
comparing likelihoods 
multiagent network independent 
likelihood values networks ideally directly compared 
visual networks assumption larger likelihood difference output networks likelihood value difference significant 
implication assumption multiagent play networks needs include approximately number attributes approximately sensitivity 
network contains relation attributes easy detect contains relation attributes difficult detect comparing likelihoods little value 
temporal structure descriptions added modifying descriptions effort keep descriptions approximately level descriptive detail avoid unwanted biases 
modeling optional actions 
discussed section algorithm currently model optional actions 
reason multiagent networks attributes evidence class play voting scheme 
optional action added attribute result decrease computed likelihood action optional action observed 
weighting factor assigned optional attribute small optional attribute may provide sufficient information differentiate actions noisy environment 
exclusive action easily modeled attribute observed likelihood action legitimately reduced 
hierarchical information 
multiagent networks implicitly encode relative importance attributes 
example fig 
relative importance attribute obj agent goal node logical relationship obj act xor obj act determined conditional probability values assigned 
different types evidence weighted differently conditional probability assignments automatically inserted multiagent network structure 
example set evidence nodes weighted classification decision evidence xor nodes 
recognizing planned action currently conditional probabilities set knowledge engineer system construction 
ideally relative weights attributes specified domain expert temporal structure description marking important necessary actions 
relative weights actions adjusted conditional probabilities entered multiagent network
