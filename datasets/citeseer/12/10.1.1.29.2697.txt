applications part speech tagging part speech tagging programs tried combine statistical gram models local combinational constraint rules various ways 
large scale pos tagging system pos tag brown corpus set constraints hand crafted linguists tag combination preferences specified window local context words

successor pos tagger built tagging follow lob corpus st order markov bigram model tag learnable pre tagged training corpus sampled brown augmented hand picked longer context constraints post editors thought improve accuracy 
widely brill tagger uses constraint rules statistical bigram model constraints machine learnt pre tagged training corpus system learn different tagging schemes different tagged training corpora 
approach requires expert linguist devise constraint grammar rule set linguistic knowledge corpus evidence 
extended statistical bigram approach sophisticated statistical models manning schutze may require larger training sets furthermore increase sophistication bigrams trigrams yield corresponding increase accuracy error rates improved dramatically
