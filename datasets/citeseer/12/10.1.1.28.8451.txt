summaries summary query expansion study summaries summary query expansion question answering task ian tombros jose department computing science university glasgow glasgow qq scotland jj dcs gla ac uk report initial study effectiveness query biased summaries task 
summarisation system presents searchers short summaries documents 
summaries composed set sentences highlight main points document relate query 
summaries evidence query expansion algorithm test summaries evidence interactive automatic query expansion 
results set experiments test approaches discuss relative success techniques 
query formulation commonly regarded demanding activities information seeking 
complexity information need increase need vague document collection unfamiliar searcher inexperienced information retrieval ir systems 
relevance feedback methods designed overcome difficulties selecting query terms detecting terms collection retrieving relevant documents 
main source evidence relevance feedback techniques documents user assessed containing relevant material 
achieve benefits relevance feedback user assess number documents retrieved response initial query 
real life situations user may willing read assess full text entire documents documents may lengthy user may time restrictions initial query may retrieved poor set documents 
alternative strategy explore user short summaries retrieved documents 
summaries allow users assess set documents enter relevance feedback quickly 
report set experiments investigate summaries interactive searching 
experiments form query biasing summarisation technique proposed tombros sanderson create short document summaries tailored user query 
summaries highly matching sentences allowing users view context query terms document 
hypothesised form summarisation allow users filter non relevant documents effectively target potentially relevant documents quickly title full text documents 
summaries form important source evidence relevance feedback algorithms potentially better full text relevant documents 
summaries display context query terms feedback sections document pertain query 
addition investigating effectiveness summaries interactive searching investigated summaries relevance feedback content summaries full text documents generate query expansion terms

qualitative analysis section summarise findings major components system relevance feedback section summarisation section 
relevance feedback relevance feedback popular searchers 
particular subjects convinced benefits rf average response question relevance feedback useful question system add terms query understand relevance feedback option 
users tried automatic expansion technique 
user seriously interactive option 
users interactive query expansion facility source new terms search 
user suggested terms add variants existing terms add place names search sites roman noted searchers experimental system tended enter new search terms modified query 
searchers control system just relevance feedback 
interviews searchers extracted main reasons terms added place names unfamiliar user thought places relevant search 
ecir summaries summary query expansion understanding relevance feedback 
subjects short tutorials systems relevance feedback explained searchers feel understood relevance feedback operated 
particular felt lacked information relevance decisions documents mark relevant mark relevant effect marking document relevant ii 
poor choice expansion terms 
users criticised choice expansion terms interactive query expansion option 
method calculating relevance weights previously shown give results automatic interactive query expansion 
expansion terms produced case useful 
reasons low numbers relevant documents processing summaries relevance weighting 
searchers tended find relatively low numbers relevant documents 
searcher relevant document display documents relevance weighting prioritised terms appeared relevant document 
case terms useful retrieving relevant documents occasionally terms turned spelling errors original documents 
flaw preparation summaries relevance weighting remove words summaries weighting 
consequently proportion suggested expansion terms consisted labels docno 
shown affect small number queries 
experiment summary determine possible expansion terms user viewed full text document 
natural enhancement may vary source expansion terms representation document viewed user 
example user viewed summary making assessment summary feedback user viewed full text document full text may better source evidence feedback 
iii 
cognitive load 
relevance feedback demonstrated provide useful technique improve retrieval effectiveness require additional actions behalf user particular marking documents relevant 
searchers keen provide additional effort especially seeing actual benefit 
iv 
search experience 
believe high familiarity web search engines subjects may contributed lack uptake relevance feedback 
web engines subjects familiar typically provide relevance feedback users forced generate new query terms 
subjects may easier submit new queries modify existing 
summarisation subjects average favour summaries average score question document summaries useful answering questions question document summaries representation full document text 
doubtful second result valid users compared full text summary 
subjects judged length summary right remaining subject said summaries short 
subjects liked simplicity interface felt summaries took long produce 
summaries produced request section consequently speed important issue system 
average time taken produce summary seconds range seconds 
practice summaries took longer average generate order seconds average 
main reason summarisation time dependent length original document 
experiments retrieved documents tended longer average document length consequently summaries took longer average produce 
criticised users 
way speed line generation summaries compute static part sentence scores section idf scores title scores ordinal weights indexing time leave scores added retrieval time 
analysis conclusive believe summaries may resulted false positive answers 
case searcher marks document supporting solely summary fact document support answer searcher identified read full text 
ecir summaries summary query expansion contributing factor misleading behaviour summaries lack coherence 
wellknown problem sentence extraction approaches 
query biased approach belief coherency problems tackled customisation summary query 
purposes time limited interactive search task users seek relevance clues order achieve goals especially context query terms documents 
intentions analyse results identify cases summaries lead users false positive answers aim improve user interaction 
example assessment document ap topic name films appeared 
summary produced document contained sentence turner entertainment said black white film classic citizen kane late director estate may right prohibit correctly identified film citizen kane films 
summary contained sentence document movie previously classics wonderful life casablanca christmas carol led searcher credit appearing films supported text full document 
may affected searchers may real concern operational environment users restricted time limitations 

research aim investigate summarisation techniques question answering task summaries relevance feedback 
main hypothesis summaries provide useful source evidence relevance feedback proved disproved due lack uptake relevance feedback experimental system 
lack relevance feedback systems disappointing demonstrates encouraging users interact system remains fundamental problem 
achieved success summaries 
subjects returned low number documents analysis showed subjects returned higher proportion supporting documents lower proportion non supporting documents summarisation system 
subjects viewed fewer full documents relevant document experimental system control system 
experiments partially completed findings indicate experimental hypothesis summaries help users target relevant documents eliminate non relevant documents effectively worth investigating 
addition positive response subjects summaries indicates summaries effective popular aid searching 
research area continuing main aims improving efficiency summarisation creation techniques improving interface increasing uptake rf 
outlined possible solution problem section pre processing documents offline 
second third issues investigating large scale evaluation users interaction summarisation systems techniques eliciting relevance information users 
study considering wider range searching tasks document types gain broader insight role summaries rf interactive searching
