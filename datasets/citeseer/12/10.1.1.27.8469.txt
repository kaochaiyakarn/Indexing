immune system overview immune system defends body harmful diseases infections 
capable recognizing virtually foreign cell molecule eliminating body 
perform pattern recognition tasks distinguish molecules cells body called self foreign ones called nonself 
problem immune system faces distinguishing self dangerous nonself 
number foreign molecules immune system recognize unknown estimated greater 
foreign proteins kinds molecules distinguished estimated different proteins self recognition highly specific 
staggering numbers especially considers human genome encodes program constructing immune system contains genes 
architecture immune system multilayered defenses provided levels 
outermost layer skin barrier infection 
second barrier physiological conditions ph temperature provide inappropriate living conditions foreign organisms pathogens 
pathogens entered body handled innate immune system adaptive immune response 
innate immune system consists primarily circulating scavenger cells extracellular molecules materials clearing system debris pathogens 
adaptive immune response called acquired immune response sophisticated involves different types cells molecules 
called adaptive adaptive response layer similar purpose traditional intrusion detection systems proposing system autonomous 
describe human immune system vertebrate immune systems quite similar 
natural immune systems plants different architectures mechanisms organizing principles similar human immune system 
responsible immunity adaptively acquired lifetime organism 
adaptive immune system provides potential computer security viewpoint focus overview 
material overview largely necessarily leave important details emphasize aspects relevant 
adaptive immune system viewed distributed detection system consists primarily white blood cells called lymphocytes 
lymphocytes function small independent detectors circulate body blood lymph systems 
lymphocytes viewed negative detectors detect nonself patterns ignore self patterns 
detection recognition nonself occurs molecular bonds formed pathogen receptors cover surface lymphocyte 
complementary molecular shape electrostatic surface charge pathogen lymphocyte receptor stronger bond higher affinity 
detection approximate lymphocyte bind different kinds structurally related pathogens 
ability detect pathogens requires huge diversity lymphocyte receptors 
diversity partly achieved generating lymphocyte receptors genetic process introduces huge amount randomness 
generating receptors randomly result lymphocytes detect self nonself cause problems immune system attacks body 
disorders rare lymphocytes self tolerant recognize self 
tolerance self achieved process called clonal deletion lymphocytes mature organ called thymus self proteins circulate bind self proteins maturing eliminated 
receptors randomly generated lymphocytes body provide complete coverage space pathogen patterns estimate different lymphocyte receptors body time detect potentially different foreign patterns 
immune system mechanisms addressing problem mechanisms immune response dynamic specific 
protection dynamic continual circulation lymphocytes body continual turnover lymphocyte population 
lymphocytes typically short lived days continually replaced new lymphocytes new randomly generated receptors 
dynamic protection increases coverage provided immune system time longer pathogen body detected encounter greater diversity lymphocytes 
protection specific learning memory 
immune system detects pathogen encountered undergoes primary response dur ing learns structure specific pathogen evolves set lymphocytes high affinity pathogen process called affinity maturation 
darwinian process variation selection resembling genetic algorithm 
high affinity lymphocytes bind tightly available pathogens stimulated reproduce great numbers resulting lymphocytes large number mutations 
new mutated lymphocytes compete pathogens parents clones 
affinity maturation produces large number lymphocytes high affinity particular pathogen accelerates detection elimination 
speed response important immune system pathogens replicating cause increasing damage numbers increase 
speed response previously encountered pathogens generally high information encoded adapted lymphocytes retained immune memory 
subsequent encounters antigen pattern immune system mounts secondary response 
case adapted lymphocytes eliminate pathogens rapidly symptoms infection noticeable individual 
mechanisms coverage provided immune system necessarily incomplete 
consequence immune system vulnerable particular pathogens 
individuals vulnerable pathogens degree individual unique immune system 
diversity immune systems population greatly enhances survival population 
way immune systems differ individual having different lymphocyte populations different detector sets 
key component gives immune system uniqueness variation molecule called major complex mhc 
mhc molecules enable immune system detect intracellular pathogens viruses reside inside cells 
intracellular pathogens problematic inside cell visible lymphocytes lymphocytes bind structures surface cells 
mhc molecules bind protein fragments called peptides viral cell transport peptides surface effectively displaying contents cell passing lymphocytes 
set proteins mhc molecule bind dependent structure mhc genetically determined 
person limited number mhc types vulnerable particular pathogens readily transported available mhc types 
population far vulnerable individual different set mhc types vulnerable different pathogens
