assistance retrieving documents web provided kinds tools search engines classified directories known catalogues 
search engines allow keyword searches content large collections web documents

unfortunately list quite long users willingness skills necessary perform complex boolean queries narrow search

navigating catalogue docking category interest user may directly access relevant sites pre categorized perform keyword searches restricted documents value catalogue expressed terms various parameters

achieving qualities catalogue difficult task 
deciding document categorized category requires extent understanding meaning categorization traditionally accomplished manually trained human classifiers 
clearly unsatisfactory categorization significant portion web requires skilled manpower srinivasan yahoo acknowledges web grows fast human keep pace manual categorization slow keep catalogue date evolution web 
new documents published old ones removed updated new categories emerge old ones fade away take new meanings 
keeping evolution manual means practically impossible manual categorization guarantee quality resulting catalogue categorization decisions highly subjective cleverdon

automatic classification typically performed comparing representations documents representations categories computing measure similarity

techniques automatically deriving representations categories category profile extraction performing classification developed area text categorization ittner lewis ng yang yang discipline crossroads information retrieval machine learning 
text categorization uses machine learning techniques inductively build representations set categories training set documents pre categorized 
automatic process compare representation categories representation document order decide categories belongs 
alternatively document compared previously classified documents placed categories similar documents placed yang avoiding need construction explicit category profiles 
document representations typically obtained standard indexing techniques developed field information retrieval salton measures similarity ones embodied vector space retrieval salton fuzzy retrieval computed order perform actual categorization

improving web search engines approaches attempted improving services provided web search engines 
altavista provides refine capability users receive suggestions terms include exclude improving query 
problem approach suggested terms statistically related query terms rarely represent useful semantic concepts refined query narrows focus search necessarily direct search topic interest 
approach puts additional burden user providing limited benefits 
infoseek provides grouping query results allows retrieving pages similar providing limited form relevance feedback harman 
related pages take user parallel possibly overlapping set classified documents necessarily focused ones 
northern light introduced technique custom search folders results traditional keyword searches dynamically organized folders containing documents similar subject source type 
folder opened new subset original result list produced containing focused results 
implement service northern light pre classifies automatically collection documents subject subject hierarchy terms hand crafted human specialists type shallow hierarchy document types language source collection home page educational site 
performing classification advance grouping query results produced quickly effectively 
custom search folders dynamically greek hero helped ariadne getting labyrinth killed 
name chosen technique developed connection search engine italian name ariadne 
created opposed static structure manually built catalogue yahoo 
example benefits approach consider query citation processing 
typical search engine return produce list hundreds documents topics include driving violation information retrieval data processing infoseek select results instance journal information retrieval ask related pages produces list times pages apparently drifting documents unrelated original query 
northern light produces number search folders including ones probation government sites archive record management document management office equipment information retrieval folder finds folders clustering relevancy ranking ac uk site journal information processing management help discriminating documents 
automated categorization techniques may lead better web retrieval tools provide access large amount date documents search engines added convenience selecting properly organized material classified directories 
lycos providing catalogue built automatic classification new catalogue consists links summary useful information regarding contents sites 
lycos uses relevance feedback users sorts list recommended web sites accordingly 
attardi uses semi automatic classification techniques matching hand crafted category profiles contents documents builds automatic summary page contents displayed catalogue 
infoseek developed tool called content classification engine organizes information automatically categories 
quickly create basic directory structure techniques import analyze information site map classify documents accordingly examining directory structure server educated guesses categorize documents 
example documents relating employee benefits kept benefits directory server employee contact details directory 
type structure exists take advantage build category tree
