miscommunication 
miscommunication particular case lack alignment agents mental state specifically diverge occurrence results communication 
austin noted communication action miscommunication viewed instances action failure speaker fails produce intended effect hearer recognize speaker intended communicate 
represent communicative act done ff means agent performed action ff ff means action ff communicative meaning 
done ff ff type miscommunication classified source non alignment communicative act problem recognizing action having occurred interpreting meaning 
clark identifies different levels conversation problems maintaining common ground may arise 
dillenbourg discuss levels generalize apply grounding multimodal collaboration 
take points section apply specifically aspects miscommunication shown table identify sources disparity belief

communication action perception perception communication action world relation world mental states agents plays important role miscommunication recovery miscommunication 
errors action perception cause lack alignment mental state causes miscommunication 
secondly world prime resource recognizing mistakes arbitrating conflicting interpretations 
looking see different vantage points considering miscommunication objective view world views agents 
subjective viewpoint non alignment achieved embedding beliefs subjective view non alignment partial motivation communication 
general case non alignment object oe simply belief held agent

consider approaches general problem reaching alignment common ground mental state including limited repairing miscommunication 
grounding grounding process adding common ground agents clark schaefer taken narrowly involves reaching state mutual understanding belief said meant 
taken generally include discounting paradoxical case agent believes belief mistaken 
strictly speaking mutuality stronger just commonality attitudes described previous section 
commonality deduced mutuality mutual belief includes additional belief commonality holds 
see clark marshall barwise halpern moses discussion issues involved 
achievement commonality agents including actual beliefs communicated information joint intentions goals action 
clark wilkes gibbs point necessary fully ground aspect interaction merely agents reach grounding criterion contributor partners mutually believe partners understood contributor meant criterion sufficient current purpose 
criterion may depends reasons needing information common ground vary type information collaborators local goals 
clark wilkes gibbs consider important principle collaborative effort 
contrary classical efficiency principles try minimize effort receiver number repairs clark wilkes gibbs principle minimize total effort collaborators 
means cases cost producing perfectly interpretable utterance may producing flawed utterance easily repaired 
costs include effort producing understanding utterance total time collaboration 
clark brennan discuss grounding different media 
point different media bring different resources constraints grounding having different associated costs 
describe media including face face telephone terminal teleconference email properties see things visibility see hear messages received time sent simultaneity parties send messages time take turns sequentiality turns get sequence review messages received producer edit message privately sending 
costs considered media formulation costs easy decide exactly say production costs articulating typing message reception costs listening reading message including attention waiting time understanding costs interpreting message context start costs initiating conversation including partner attention delay costs making receiver wait formulation asynchrony costs able tell responded speaker change costs fault costs repair costs 
different media different combinations constraints costs expect principle collaborative effort predict different styles grounding different media
