employee timetabling problem problem main entities employee shift task type simply task location 
assume employees em shifts sn tasks locations locations correspond working places production lines industrial plant production scheduling departments hospital nurse scheduling tasks correspond speci activities ful lled system shift carpenter head nurse controller 
employee different tasks di erent shifts 
regarding shifts assume temporal horizon week xed structure hours shifts day working days 
shifts numbered consecutively starting monday morning 
certain shifts particularly inconvenient involved speci constraints objectives 
call special shifts 
night shifts mod weekend shifts prede ned special shifts 
special shifts added user 
shifts de ned special limited subset tasks regular tasks 
employees usually able ful ll di erent tasks di erent ability 
employees full time part time workers 
employees exible workload available working regular workload single week exibility 
positive negative variations taken account need removed yearly basis 
problem consists assigning employees tasks locations shifts satisfying hard constraints minimizing objective function de ned 
requirements shift required number employees pair location task 
ability employee quali cations enable ful ll certain types tasks 
availability personal availabilities employees restrict assigned subsets shifts 
con icts employee assigned task shift 
addition employees assigned shifts con ict 
xed shift structure considered shifts con ict ji jj 
means employee rest hours working shifts 
workload employee contractual number working shifts week typically full time workers 
actual workload week exible upper lower limit di erence number shifts employee assigned week 
objective function problem weighted sum components soft constraints 
preferential ability availability tasks employee able di erent degrees skill 
similarly available shifts personal preferences system take account 
reasons ability availability data binary values integers serve hard soft constraints 
workload exibility employee store separate historical data positive exibility weeks worked negative exibility weeks worked 
components objective function devoted cumulated exibility order importance balance positive negative exibility tend 
importance objective increases approaching year 
positive negative exibility values kept uniform possible employees 
fairness special shifts special shifts assigned preferably employees worked shifts past weeks employees regular workload week 
shift location stability preferable employee shift morning afternoon night location week 
notice computation objectives requires complex aggregations historical data current year 
data needs updated scheduled week 
notice shift stability considered hard constraint literature 
workers regulations allow exible assignment increases signi cantly possibilities satisfy constraints
