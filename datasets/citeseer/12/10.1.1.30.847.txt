dictionary includes comlex syntax dictionary large general purpose english dictionary plus various special dictionaries dictionaries major place names major companies common american names suffixes 
example sam harry tagged names tagged suffix 
name recognition phase processing identifies various types proper names special forms dates currency amounts 
names appear frequently types texts identifying classifying simplifies processing names furthermore important argument values extraction tasks 
names identified set patterns regular expressions stated terms parts speech syntactic features orthographic features capitalization 
personal names example identified preceding title smith common name fred smith suffix smith jr middle initial humble hopp available linguistic data consortium 
addition system uses probabilistic part speech tagger bbn exclude part speech assignments system operate tagger slightly degraded performance 
names usually identified final token associates bank major names general motors may mentioned overt clues important dictionary major companies 
example passage names identified name type person sam schwartz retired executive vice president famous hot dog manufacturer name type succeeded name type person harry 
name identification typically includes processing required identify aliases name effect name coreference 
example system identify larry subsequent mention hewlett packard hp 
alias identification may help name classification 
read humble hopp reported may know humble hopp person subsequent hopp ambiguity resolved 
name identification worked quite intensively past years incorporated products extract classified name lists documents 
highest performing systems large numbers hand coded patterns performance systems learn rules annotated corpora steadily improving percent hand coded systems 
syntactic structure identifying aspects syntactic structure simplifies subsequent phase fact extraction 
arguments extracted correspond noun phrases text relationships extracted correspond grammatical functional relations 
hand identification complete syntactic structure sentence difficult task 
result great variation amount syntactic structure explicitly identified 
trade offs discussed section 
systems don separate phase syntactic analysis 
attempt build complete parse sentence 
systems fall build series parse fragments 
general build structures quite certain syntactic semantic evidence 
current nyu proteus system lead sri fastus system builds structures noun groups noun plus left modifiers verb groups verb built cases just local syntactic information 
addition builds certain larger noun phrase structures conjoined noun groups noun groups modifiers semantic information confirm correctness structure 
done regular expression pattern matcher systems special procedures parsing 
set patterns labels basic noun groups noun phrases np example includes names pronoun larger noun groups 
followed set label verb groups vg 
patterns applied text labeled follows np entity sam schwartz vg retired np entity executive vice president np entity famous hot dog manufacturer np entity np entity vg succeeded np entity harry 
associated constituent certain features tested patterns subsequent stages 
vg include information tense past voice active passive root form verb np information root form head including name syntactic number 
addition np system creates semantic entity example entities created entity type person name sam schwartz entity type position value executive vice president entity type manufacturer entity type name entity type person entity type person name harry sets patterns follow build larger noun phrase structures attaching right modifiers 
syntactic ambiguity right modifiers patterns incorporate semantic constraints noun verb group patterns domain specific 
patterns typically coalesce noun phrases possible intervening words larger noun phrase modify entity associated head noun incorporate information modifier 
example text relevant patterns recognize appositive construction description name prepositional phrase construction position example sequences look apposition part conjoined structures prepositional phrases right noun attach preceding verb 
second pattern position represents pattern element matches np entity type position matches np entity type 
system includes small semantic type hierarchy isa hierarchy pattern matching uses isa relation subtype example manufacturer matched 
pattern name specifies np type head name description specifies np type head common noun 
patterns produce labeling np entity sam schwartz vg retired np entity executive vice president famous hot dog manufacturer np entity vg succeeded np entity harry 
entities updated follows entity type person name sam schwartz entity type position value executive vice president entity type manufacturer name entity type person entity type person name harry scenario pattern matching processing sense preparatory scenario pattern matching 
role patterns extract events relationships relevant scenario 
example executive succession patterns person retires position person succeeded person person position pattern elements match np associated type 
retires succeeded pattern elements match active passive verb groups respectively 
result text labeled clauses pointing event structure event structures point turn previously created entities clause event sam schwartz retired executive vice president famous hot dog manufacturer clause event succeeded harry 
entities events updated follows current system new label subsumes earlier labels earlier labels longer visible subsequent patterns removed labels text removed entity 
entity type person name sam schwartz entity type position value executive vice president entity type manufacturer name entity type person entity type person name harry event type leave job person position event type succeed person person coreference analysis coreference analysis task resolving anaphoric pronouns definite noun phrases 
little text example pronoun entity 
coreference analysis look previously mentioned entity type person find entity 
effect change refer leaving events entities entity type person name sam schwartz entity type position value executive vice president entity type manufacturer name entity type person name harry event type leave job person position event type succeed person person coreference module isa hierarchy appeared text properly resolved entity manufacturer 
inferencing event merging situations partial information event may spread sentences information needs combined template generated 
cases information implicit needs explicit inference process 
executive succession domain need determine succeed predicate implies wish ultimately produce templates specifying particular individuals got lost particular positions 
example sam president 
succeeded harry 
infer harry president conversely sam president succeeds harry 
infer harry president 
inferences implemented production system rules fact inferences hard coded system muc production systems similar rules prior muc systems 
leave job person job succeed person person start job person job start job person job succeed person person leave job person job leave events entity type person name sam schwartz entity type position value executive vice president entity type manufacturer name entity type person name harry event type leave job person position event type succeed person person event type start job person position translated templates shown earlier 
simple scenario shown require take account time event 
scenarios time important times reported sequence events significant 
cases time information may derived sources including absolute dates times april relative dates times week verb tenses knowledge inherent sequence events 
time analysis may interact inferences discourse normally performed part stage processing 
evaluation noted unusual aspects information extraction degree development past decade fostered shaped series evaluations message understanding conferences muc 
order understand discussion follows progress problems information extraction need briefly describe muc evaluation process 
muc evaluation participants initially detailed description scenario information extracted set documents templates extracted documents training corpus 
systems developers get time months adapt system new scenario 
time participant gets new set documents test corpus uses system extract information documents returns extracted templates conference organizer 
organizer manually filled set templates answer key test corpus 
system assigned variety scores comparing system response answer key 
primary scores precision recall 
key total number filled slots answer key response total number filled slots system response correct number correctly filled slots system response number match answer key 
precision correct response recall correct key score combined recall precision score theta precision theta recall precision recall 
design issues parse parse noted evident differences extraction systems involves amount syntactic analysis performed 
benefits syntax analysis noted 
particular arguments wish collect scenario pattern matching usually connected grammatical relations example want extract subject object verbs hire fire succeed 
syntactic relations correctly marked expect scenario patterns simpler accurate 
considerations motivated early extraction systems perform full syntactic analysis looking scenario patterns 
building complete syntactic structure easy 
decisions conjunction scope attachment modifiers particularly difficult 
principle full sentence analyzers able global constraints resolve local ambiguities 
fact inevitable gaps grammatical lexical coverage full sentence parsers may making poor local decisions structures quest create parse spanning entire sentence 
effect global constraints may things worse 
furthermore full sentence parsers relatively expensive computer time surprising large space search 
note information extraction interested grammatical relations relevant scenario correctly determining relations may waste time 
result current high performance extraction systems create partial syntactic structures syntactic structures created high confidence local information 
systems bbn system separate parsing procedures 
considerations just listed led shift full parsing approach employed earlier partial parsing described 
specifically followed approach adopted fastus brackets noun verb groups structures quite reliably identified local information 
addition illustrated common ambiguity regarding noun groups involves leading participles classic example flying planes 
cases bracket earlier example identify larger noun phrase constituents semantic evidence confirm correctness attachment 
general say current extraction systems parse conservatively strong evidence correctness reduction 
gains benefits full parse introducing errors block applications scenario patterns 
traditional syntactic analysis role identifying syntactic structure regularizing syntactic structure 
particular different clausal forms active passive forms relative clauses reduced relatives mapped essentially structure 
regularization simplifies scenario pattern matching need deal fewer forms scenario pattern 
employ partial parsing approach perform regularization separate scenario patterns syntactic form effect multiplying number patterns written factor 
example need separate patterns ibm hired harry harry hired ibm ibm hired harry 
harry hired ibm 
harry hired ibm lessen burden sri fastus system nyu proteus system introduced metarules rule schemata methods writing single basic pattern having transformed patterns needed various syntactic forms clause 
write subject verb hired object person system generate patterns hired person person hired hired person person hired person hired approach bears similarity metarules gpsg generalized phrase structure grammar expand small set productions larger set involving different clause level structures 
clausal patterns need account modifiers intervene sentence elements interest 
example may find subject verb sentence modifiers minimal noun group excluding participle subsequent patterns possibility may participle preceding noun group 
ibm yesterday promoted smith executive vice president 
noun modifiers accounted noun phrase patterns ge founded promoted smith president 
partial parsing approach need include optional pattern elements separately clausal pattern match modifiers 
metarule mechanism automatically insert pattern elements appropriate positions clausal pattern 
way regain benefits syntactically clausal analysis 
widespread partial parsing reflection current state full sentence parsing technology experience shows parsers introduce errors fix information extraction tasks 
parsing technology improving rapidly largely corpus methods 
years ago hand coded grammars operating newspaper texts got recall precision scores range 
parsers trained large hand bracketed corpora gotten recall precision scores performance steadily improving 
performance gets may worth revisiting decision full sentence parsing 
portability barriers making information extraction practical technology cost adapting extraction system new scenario 
general application extraction involve different scenario 
implementing scenario requires months effort skills extraction system designers market extraction systems remain limited 
need tools allow potential users adapt system create initial system days weeks months 
basic question developing customization tool form level information obtained user assuming goal customization performed directly user expert system developer 
pattern matching system probably focused development set patterns 
changes needed semantic hierarchy set inference rules rules creating output templates 
users considerable experience writing patterns regular expressions associated actions familiarity formal syntactic structure may find difficult inconvenient operate directly patterns 
possibility provide graphical representation patterns finite state network exposes details parseval metric compares bracketing produced system university pennsylvania tree bank 
patterns 
groups developing systems obtain information primarily examples sentences interest information extracted 
sites experiment approach university massachusetts amherst 
system developed muc relied large number small lexically triggered patterns built individual concepts concepts consolidated create information needed template filling 
muc developed tool autoslog create patterns semi automatically development corpus templates 
template slot filled words text name program search words text hypothesize pattern immediate context words example governing verb noun phrase 
patterns system developer accept reject pattern 
developed system uses machine learning techniques rely human review 
system seeks generalize merge patterns derived individual examples checking resulting patterns match corpus examples marked relevant scenario 
earlier involved large training corpora documents templates corpora encouraged approach 
centralized preparation large consistent training corpora proved expensive proposition suggested large corpora available real tasks 
users may willing prepare examples best dozen examples filled templates 
experiments smaller training collections documents provided muc suggest fully automated learning techniques provided text examples associated templates minimal automatic syntactic generalization may able achieve sufficient coverage 
possible compensate part lack training data providing information example 
hasten system developed sra muc developer builds structural description example marking type constituent constraints constituent semantic label constituent 
approach able achieve level performance muc task requires expertise part developer mark examples 
nyu building interactive tool customizing extraction system 
believe provide efficient approach acquisition situations user large pre annotated corpus fact may refining scenario response new examples expertise create patterns unaided 
user begins providing example normally drawn corpus fact template extracted 
system responds existing patterns create structural description example 
interact user extend generalize example syntactically semantically 
syntactic gen produced metarule mechanism discussed semantic generalizations produced isa hierarchy 
way possible quickly extend single example pattern broad coverage 
addition allowing user see examples corpus match generated pattern possible insure pattern 
improving performance major barrier widespread extraction systems limitation performance 
observer muc muc struck relatively similar level performance top ranked systems 
systems got scores range reflecting recall precision 
account clustering performance 
response speculative 
part reflects convergence technologies top systems fairly similar design 
probably reflects characteristics task 
reasonable know linguistic phenomena distribution vocabulary syntactic structures large fraction relevant facts encoded linguistically small number forms small number lexical items small number syntactic structures 
result relatively easy reasonable framework established reach level performance 
point working tail distribution linguistic phenomena improvement increasingly expensive 
hope move tail improve extraction performance fixed investment labor new scenario 
shortcomings represent scenario independent phenomena 
include complex syntactic structures different types subordinate clauses complex anaphoric phenomena anaphors split antecedents 
temporal information plays significant role extraction tasks temporal processing independent specific scenario 
aspects core extraction system gradually enhanced expect improvement performance scenarios 
shortcomings performance reflect lack knowledge relative specific scenario difficult address 
tools interacting users acquire generalize patterns improve expect augment knowledge rapidly 
example tool suggests related lexical items broaden lexical coverage seen training corpus 
addition extraction scenarios implemented expect see pattern sets applicable families related scenarios entire domains 
example patterns basic actions purchase sale goods may applicable scenarios domain business 
interactive analysis requires fast extraction system current nyu system process typical newspaper article seconds high pc
