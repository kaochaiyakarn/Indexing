implications traffic important implications heavy tailed file size distributions network engineering lies connection traffic self similarity 
previous shown network traffic considered time series representing bytes packets unit time typically shows self similar characteristics scaling parameter

transmission time distribution appears heavier tailed silent time distribution distribution file sizes web primary determiner web traffic self similarity 
web traffic currently responsible half traffic global internet presence strong self similarity web traffic implications performance internet 
pkc shown presence self similarity large values network traffic severe performance effects network significant buffering 
buffering refers storage network temporarily hold packets wait transmission 
buffer related burstiness traffic burst occurs transmission channels overloaded packets need buffered waiting transmission channels available 
traffic strongly self similar nature bursts occur wide range timescales 
long bursts occur packets may require buffering 
negative effects result 
packets stored large buffer wait long periods transmitted 
problem packet delay 
second buffers finite demand placed large burst may exceed capacity 
case networks discard packets leading problem decreased throughput network bandwidth retransmit packets 
practice network buffers usually large avoid problem packet loss maintain high throughput
