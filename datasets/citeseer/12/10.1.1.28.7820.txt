informal semantics choose model world temporal structure branching time single past called time tree 
particular time point particular world called situation 
event types transform time point 
primitive events events directly agent uniquely determine time point time tree 
non primitive events map non adjacent time points allowing model partial nature plans 
potential decomposition primitive events model hierarchical plan development 
branches time tree viewed representing choices available agent moment time 
example branches emanating particular time point labeled say agent choice executing moving time point branch time tree labeled executing likewise moving associated branch 
course agent may attempt execute event fail 
distinguish successful execution events failure label branches accordingly
