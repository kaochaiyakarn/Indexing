general proximate selection involves entering variables locus selection particular interest user interfaces automatically default locus user current location 
kinds located objects interesting select technique 
kind computer input output devices require location 
includes printers displays speakers video cameras 
second kind set objects interacting need addressed software process 
includes people room beam document 
third kind set places wants find restaurants night clubs gas stations stores generically exits entrances 
consider electronic yellow pages directory city divisions information sorts represented businesses distance reader 
location information weight choices printers nearby 

shows proximate selection dialogs printers columns name printer location distance user 
interface issue navigate dialogs contain additional location information 
example dialogs familiar alphabetical ordering name ordered location 
shown alphabetically ordering name ordered proximity alphabetical nearby printers emphasized alphabetical selections scaled proximity perspective view 
factor proximate selection interfaces take account bandwidth requirements 
presenting information changes due user moving contents dialog changing people moving cause update network traffic 
approach view location information precision situation

driving town dialog example change viewer objects selection dialog crossed city limits 
proximate selection may choose virtual objects 
parctab voting application users select previously created ballots alphabetically current location 
proximate selection helpful ballots referenced particular locations voting high tea meeting group just created ballot 
user interfaces proximate selection pose challenges 
example ui display alphabetical proximity information simultaneously 
map imagery may provide ui metaphor 
proximate selection may occur mobile host ui techniques developed take account device capabilities screen real estate communication bandwidth 
appear ieee workshop mobile computing systems applications december automatic contextual reconfiguration reconfiguration process adding new components removing existing components 
altering connections components 
typical components connections servers communication channels clients 
reconfigurable components may include loadable device drivers program modules hardware elements case context aware systems interesting aspect context bring different system configurations 
group people place people easily share physical objects place 
example people meeting room share table hold scattered papers whiteboard diagrams 
promote similar sharing wrote multi user drawing program parctab provides workspace room sort virtual whiteboard 
entering room causes automatic binding mobile host room virtual whiteboard 
way people room easily collaborate virtual whiteboard 
moving different room brings different drawing surface 
automatic reconfiguration creates illusion accessing virtual object physical 
reconfiguration information addition location example people room 
project group meeting project whiteboard active 
change virtual whiteboards powerful physical analogues virtual whiteboard persist meeting meeting follow participants room room 
contextual reconfiguration include operating system functions example leaving disk spinning mobile power connection 
schilit duchamp describe operating system memory nearby idle computers backing store swapping local remote disk 
context hosts vicinity define system configuration hosts change location configuration adapts accordingly 
systems reconfigure context subject problems faced reconfigurable systems general 
addition context changing rapidly may distracting user impractical due performance adapt change 
certain may confuse users particularly context incorrectly reported user unaware context application considers relevant context changes 
address issues 
contextual information commands people actions predicted situation 
certain things library kitchen office 
contextual information commands aim exploit fact 
queries contextual information produce different results context issued 
similarly context parameterize contextual commands example print command default print nearest printer 
location browser parctab application views location filesystem directories named locations contain files programs links 
moving room room browser changes displayed directory match viewer location 
example office see occupant finger plan calendar files 
public area lab see general description research group near kitchen see directions making coffee finding supplies 
location directories writable group add customized information 
researcher leave electronic post note colleagues telling plans return office 
aside displaying data files parameterized viewer location location browser runs programs 
contextual commands kind may take forms 
appearance command change depending context 
example library button invoke card catalogue database appear normally hidden 
second command may appear produce parameterized results 
example location browser presents migrate button user interface appears identical room room causes user windows migrate different host displays depending location invoked 
location browser contrasts scoreboard application takes advantage large foot stationary displays public areas 
program monitors users pass vicinity shows information interested latest hockey scores 
third example exploiting contextual information lamming newman activity information retrieval

appear ieee workshop mobile computing systems applications december category example date time april noon location room location ftype having table predicates context triggered actions contextual information commands pose challenges 
businesses government agencies find profitable export contextual information commands order inexpensively engage large numbers potential customers 
people interacting third parties need ensure security authenticity information 
personal customizations coordinate provided third parties 
context triggered actions context triggered actions simple rules specify context aware systems adapt 
information context condition clause triggers consequent commands living rule expert system 
number applications organized way 
category context aware software similar contextual information commands context triggered action commands invoked automatically previously specified rules 
sample predicate set include forms 
experimented context triggered action applications active badge watchdog tab contextual reminders watchdog program monitors active badge activity executes arbitrary unix shell commands 
startup program reads user configuration file containing description active badge events actions 
entries form badge location event type action badge strings match badge wearer sighting location

include badge owner owner office sighting location name nearest host 
example coffee kitchen arriving play sounds rooster au schilit attention emacs display example monitors coffee badge attached coffee maker kitchen plays rooster sound coffee 
second starts emacs window nearby host attention signal received 
addition generating normal functions reminders certain dates times contextual reminders permit fuller description situation reminder occur 
message pops 
example time library time see marvin back desk parctab implementation contextual reminders pops message tab different situations occur 
user may edit reminder dismiss ignore 
problems building context triggered actions include balance requirement timely execution need predictable behavior systems transition number states may desirable intermediary actions triggered delaying long system sluggish
