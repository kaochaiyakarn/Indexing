similarly define union consonants fragment union vowels various cv templates regular languages consisting concatenations consonants vowels 
define etcetera define define define define etcetera vocalizations defined similarly define nv define nv arabic morphological analysis internet nv denotes regular language consisting number ignoring non vowel symbols 
definitions stems computed straightforwardly intersection drs yields regular language consisting just string drs yields stem drs yields stem symbol realized copy previous consonant subsequently applied variation rules similar finite state treatment

xerox arabic morphological analysis generator available testing internet september 
currently underlying lexicons include roots hand encoded indicate subset patterns combine practice average root participates distinct stems yielding approximately stems roots patterns 
phonologically indistinguishable lower side resulting approximately root pattern intersections performed compilation 
pattern dictionary contains phonologically distinct entries ambiguous 
include prefixes suffixes stems root 
altogether lexicon compiles finite state transducer accounts words analyzed possible spellings ranging diacritics fully 
additions lexicon easy trained internal codes 
xerox system research stage project continued commercialized sufficient interest shown 
known dictionary needs proper names testing doubt uncover omissions 
need devise way handle multi word expressions expands part speech disambiguation parsing 
continue user interface including provision new virtual keyboard layouts paste input online text 
analyzer may redesigned take advantage newest finite state algorithms merge provide efficient way perform intersections build stems
