ontology ontologies deliberately addressed interdisciplinary audience advisable pay attention preliminary terminological clarifications especially crucial terms appear different senses different communities consider distinction ontology capital statement ontology fascinating discipline ontology lowercase expressions aristotle ontology cyc ontology 
term uncountable reading case countable reading 
reading reasonably clear referring particular philosophical discipline different senses assumed philosophical community artificial intelligence community general computer science community term 
philosophical sense may refer ontology particular system categories accounting certain vision world 
system depend particular language aristotle ontology independently language describe 
hand prevalent ai ontology refers engineering artifact constituted specific vocabulary describe certain reality plus set explicit assumptions regarding intended meaning vocabulary words 
set assumptions usually form order logical theory vocabulary words appear unary binary predicate names respectively called concepts relations 
simplest case ontology describes hierarchy concepts related subsumption relationships sophisticated cases suitable axioms added order express relationships concepts constrain intended interpretation 
readings ontology described related order solve terminological impasse need choose inventing new name shall adopt ai reading word conceptualization refer philosophical reading 
ontologies different vocabulary english italian words instance sharing conceptualization 
elaborate material published case ontology called formal ontology shall expression formal ontology refer philosophical research field 
conceptualization 
notion conceptualization introduced requires suitable formalization may generate confusions 
conceptualization defined known ai textbook structure domain set relevant relations definition tom gruber defined ontology specification conceptualization 
giaretta discussed definition arguing order sense different intensional account notion conceptualization introduced 
try clarify notions making clear relationship ontology intended models conceptualization 
problem genesereth nilsson notion conceptualization refers ordinary mathematical relations extensional relations 
relations reflect particular state affairs instance blocks world may reflect particular arrangement blocks table 
need focus meaning relations independently state affairs instance meaning relation lies way refers certain couples blocks spatial arrangement 
need speak intensional relations shall call conceptual relations reserving simple term relation ordinary mathematical relations 
standard way represent intensions conceptual relations see functions possible worlds sets 
disadvantages works fairly purposes 
ordinary relations defined certain domain conceptual relations defined domain space 
shall define domain space structure domain set maximal states affairs domain called possible worlds 
instance may set blocks table set possible spatial arrangements blocks 
domain space shall define conceptual relation arity total function dn set ary ordinary relations generic conceptual relation set contain extensions 
conceptualization defined ordered triple set conceptual relations domain space say conceptualization set conceptual relations defined domain space 
consider structure introduced 
refers particular world state affairs shall call world structure 
easy see conceptualization contains world structures world shall called intended world structures conceptualization 
conceptualization 
possible world intended structure structure wc wc wc set extensions relative elements 
shall denote set wc intended world structures subsequent nils nilsson stresses importance conceptualization modeling task 
instance relations triangle turn extension possible worlds 
symbols denoting structures sets sets appear boldface 
consider logical language vocabulary rearranging standard definition define model structure world structure interpretation function assigning elements constant symbols elements predicate symbols known model fixes particular extensional interpretation language 
analogously fix intensional interpretation means structure conceptualization function assigning elements constant symbols elements predicate symbols shall call intensional interpretation ontological commitment ontological commitment say commits means underlying conceptualization language vocabulary ontological commitment model compatible ii constant iii exists world predicate symbol maps predicate extension exists conceptual relation 
set models compatible called set intended models general way reconstruct ontological commitment language set intended models model necessarily reflect particular world fact relevant relations considered may completely characterize state affairs model may describe situation common states affairs 
means impossible reconstruct correspondence worlds extensional relations established underlying conceptualization 
set intended models weak characterization conceptualization just excludes absurd interpretations really describing meaning vocabulary 
ontology clarify role ontology considered set logical axioms designed account intended meaning vocabulary 
language ontological commitment ontology set axioms designed way set models approximates best possible set intended models fig 

general easy convenient find right set axioms ontology admit models intended ones 
ontology specify conceptualization indirect way approximate set intended models ii set intended models weak characterization conceptualization shall say ontology language approximates conceptualization exists ontological commitment intended models included models expression ontological commitment denote result commitment terminology underlying conceptualization 
mistake version published fois proceedings due erroneous quantification possible worlds 
version correct 
point compatible model pick single possible world 
statement clarifies possible confusion arising stated definition ontology explicit partial account conceptualization rephrased ontology explicit partial account intended models logical language 
seen conceptualization equivalent set intended models statements equivalent implies 
ontology commits designed purpose characterizing ii approximates language commits ontology commits conceptualization agrees clarifications come definition refines gruber definition making clear difference ontology conceptualization ontology logical theory accounting intended meaning formal vocabulary ontological commitment particular conceptualization world 
intended models logical language vocabulary constrained ontological commitment 
ontology indirectly reflects commitment underlying conceptualization approximating intended models 
relationships vocabulary conceptualization ontological commitment ontology illustrated fig 

important stress ontology conceptualization language independent 
de facto ai term ontology collapses aspects clear separation essential address issues related ontology sharing fusion translation general imply multiple vocabularies multiple conceptualizations

intended models logical language reflect commitment conceptualization 
ontology indirectly reflects commitment underlying conceptualization approximating set intended models 
coarse vs fine grained ontologies ontology indirectly accounts conceptualization may wonder get close 
fact classify ontologies accuracy characterizing conceptualization commit 
possible ways ontology get closer conceptualization developing richer axiomatization adopting richer domain richer set relevant conceptual relations 
necessarily formal vocabulary part logical language example may pro tocol communication agents 
case distance set ontology models set intended models reduced 
second case possible principle include set relevant conceptual relations relations characterize world state extending time domain order include entities involved relations instance case blocks world may consider spatial location block relevant conceptual relation including locations domain considering relation completely derivable locations model carries information concerning state world refers underlying conceptualization reconstructed set intended models 
case ontology axiomatized way exactly models perfect ontology 
possibility increase accuracy ontology consists adopting modal logic allows express constraints worlds just reifying worlds ordinary objects domain 
course tradeoff coarse fine grained ontology committing conceptualization gets closer specifying intended meaning vocabulary may establish consensus sharing vocabulary knowledge base uses vocabulary may hard develop reason number axioms expressiveness language adopted 
coarse ontology hand may consist minimal set axioms written language minimal expressivity support limited set specific services intended shared users agree underlying conceptualization 
distinguish detailed ontologies coarse shareable ontologies line online ontologies accessed time time purposes support core system functionalities 
ontology integration problem seen information integration major application area ontologies 
known systems adopt vocabulary guarantee agree certain information commit conceptualization 
assuming system conceptualization necessary condition order agreement possible intended models original conceptualizations overlap fig

important benefit ontology development time enables developer practice higher level reuse usually case software engineering knowledge reuse software reuse 
enables developer reuse share application domain knowledge common vocabulary heterogeneous software platforms 
enables developer concentrate structure domain task hand protects bothered implementation details 
unfortunately availability shelf ontologies way today extremely limited see instance example reuse ontology physical measures 
opinion reason ontologies general effectively specialized various applications 
cases integration shelf ontologies necessary encounter problems discussed section 
second scenario depicted appears realistic 
quantity ontological knowledge available may modest quality nature fundamental ontological distinctions help designer task conceptual analysis 
practice role ontology case building block going adapted reused powerful tool analogous case computer aided software engineering tool increase quality analysis process 
words think case develop application ontology help relatively small top level ontology necessarily having developed domain ontology hand 
important point keep mind ontology driven development ontology build new engineering equally profitably re engineering order increase reuse maintainability
