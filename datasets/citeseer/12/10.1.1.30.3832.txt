fairly straightforward refine notion dependency definition adequate purposes 
definition dependency chain list delta delta delta dependency cycle dependency chain begins ends slot 
dependency cycles reflect potential problems model 
indicated discussion correct models may appear problematic simply overestimate probabilistic dependencies 
dependency cycle containing instance frame corresponds possible chain dependencies depends 
cyclic dependency exists prevents defining coherent probability model 
dependency cycle containing class means instance instance depends cases necessarily instance cases called truly cyclic 
distinct instances class cases problematic may represent infinite dependency chain depends depends models typically defined probabilistic semantics 
conclude discussion want disallow dependency cycles 
types dependency cycles easy prevent purely local considerations 
specifically build class dependency graph graph contains slots edge dependency holds 
clearly want avoid dependency cycles graph acyclic 
care designing dependency model inverse slots implies class dependency graphs acyclic avoid truly cyclic dependency chains class level 
formally define class level dependency chain classes obtain theorem theorem knowledge base class dependency graphs acyclic truly cyclic class level dependency chains 
discussed dependency chains truly cyclic result incoherent models 
addition eliminated instance level dependency chains truly cyclic 
unfortunately general problem easy prevent purely local constraints 
detect kb contains dependency cycle building global directed graph called dependency graph kb 
nodes class named slot edge dependency holds

random sampling process implicitly defines distribution different possible value assignments probability value assignment probability generated process 
note random sampling process stochastic algorithm approximate inference proposing approach sampling process purely thought experiment defining distribution 
section show standard process exact inference effectively answer queries relative distribution 
sampling process builds value assignments slots frames incrementally different components required 
allowing partial assignments bypass problem going infinite sampling chains 
assumption finite dependency chains guarantees sampling chains required sample value simple slot terminate 
definition partial value instance frame assignment values appropriate type subset simple slots assignment instance frames appropriate class subset complex slots partial value assigned instances 
final subtlety arises sampling construction

assignment done explicit statement named instance frame process inheritance template slot class instance belongs 
explained section semantics assignments condition distribution 
obtain right semantics obvious modification data generating process 
sampling process value generated slot inconsistent observed value simply discard entire partial value generated point

procedure returns partial value global variable procedure contains value lemma dependency graph acyclic sample executed partial value defines probability distribution extensions value assigned furthermore depend order parents examined 
proof basic steps proof follows

proof proceeds simple inductive argument length dependency chains 
prove distribution independent order observe simple slot generated conditional distribution regardless sampled failure conditions applied universally

case single valued slots specific value may asserted multi valued slot class named individual 
interpret assignments asserting values prevent having values fact multiple values may asserted slot 
assignments eliminate number uncertainty slot case slot fewer number asserted fillers eliminated condition num asserted number 
assert values mentioned need explicitly assert value num

note inverse slot may multi valued 
relations give rise potentially infinite chains
