observations really discern clear indications relative quality fh ehc larger benchmarks 
discussion approach describe provides excellent results difficult benchmark problems 
guarantee approach generalise successfully real problems perform just different larger benchmarks clearly promising basis continued research lines 
particularly encouraging best results achieved essentially simple technique improvements readily imagined 
augments continuing theme ga research literature shows gas compete closely outperform known methods problems successfully 
way study sophisticated heuristics strategies 
context interplay ga heuristics results appear counter findings suggest search done ga expense heuristic better terms final solution quality probably expense time 
results authors applications tend show opposite better quality results arrive heuristic little extra time cost 
reconciliation counter observations readily recognising generalisations necessarily small space possible experiments mercy investigation 
better solution quality may arrived pure ga approach job op extreme cost time job op compete terms solution quality ehc may possible far larger population sizes consequently wait far longer convergence 
bagchi notion intuitive sense consider allows ga full rein space possible solutions searching contracted space effectively done hybrid methods 
expansion space allow ga survey carries need extensive sampling larger population sizes 
hybrid ga heuristic method tends better practical choice offering better tradeoff terms speed vs quality problems

schedule builder identifies job currently referred chromosome heuristic choice earlier choices schedule constrain set valid alternative process plans live job 
valid set treated circular chosen directed chromosome 
course possibilities 
example essentially representation simpler ossp change interpretation heuristically choose valid process plan th uncompleted job heuristically choose operation plan place earliest place fit developing schedule 
involves addition heuristic choose process plan choose operation 
possibilities heuristic chooses process plan easily imagined 
example choose plan total processing time remaining smallest 
second important difference jobs due dates need considered relative precedence 
dealt approach simply incorporating considerations fitness function 
fitness measure combination makespan schedule extents job precedences due dates met 
alternatively preference due date information may readily incorporated heuristic 
example heuristic chooses job planning scheduling reasoning actions fang ross corne largest processing time choose job maximises function processing time extent due date met 
various possibilities apparent extending approach deal general problems 
reported example context highly generalised manufacturing scheduling problems report ga simple heuristics chromosomes direct representations schedules 
main point show approach readily allows extensions allow cope problems fully general kind real machine shop environments retaining basic flavour retaining presumed source success 
may immediately apparent success demonstrate simplified benchmark carry effective performance complex problems extended approach apparent reason skeptical possibility 
lines reported due course 
approach ossp performs benchmark twice outperforming previous reported attempts 
discussed approach may extended deal realistic problems simplicity approach apparent success evident potential improvement extension render promising method research 
ultimately course comparisons ai methods instructive 
approach fails meet possible needs schedule managers may machine shop environments clear way rescheduling addressed redefining problem necessary running ga scratch sophisticated technique information gained formation previous schedule rescheduling potentially speedy process 
noted ga configuration experiments optimal 
continuing ga research reveals variants techniques ga application researchers find rewarding heed
