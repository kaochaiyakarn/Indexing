long key press errors alphanumeric key unintentionally pressed longer default key repeat delay 
majority operating systems repeat keys facility allows user control length time key held repeats 
setting appropriate delay disabling key repeats altogether prevent long key press errors 

dropping errors user fails press keys simultaneously shift key 
error type just manifestation difficulty pressing keys 
sticky keys facility activated causes modifier keys latch 
pressed stay active key pressed 
sticky keys user presses shift produce capital 
sticky keys eliminate dropping errors
