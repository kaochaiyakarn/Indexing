properties mappings increasing number modeling languages important introduce systematic techniques constructing mappings transformations modeling languages proving mappings correct 
section discuss general terms issues arise constructing mappings modeling languages 
constructing mappings modeling languages important understand goals purpose mappings 
precise statement goals purpose essential dealing mapping issues mapping required preserve semantics 
ideally languages defined notions semantics 
practice best hope reasonably precise convincing argument semantics preserved 
mapping required defined entire modeling language 
cases may suffice define mapping subset modeling language 
purpose mapping answer question 
language simply means front constructing models second language reasonable constructs language needed second 
mapping simply way mapping language defined directions 
mapping defined directions called way mapping 
mapping way mapping directions inverses 
having inverse mappings generally possible languages similar 
case uml daml 
discussion mapping properties precise need introduce concepts 
presume modeling language notion semantic equivalence 
precise meaning notion depend language usually takes form models semantically equivalent correspondence instances instances preserves relationships instances 
semantic equivalence models mean models differ inessential ways renaming reordering adding redundancy 
presume model language serialized unique way 
example serialize uml model daml defined terms rdf standard xml representation 
model language size serialization unit appropriate serialization number characters 
size written suppose modeling languages 
mapping function models models preserves semantic equivalence 
words semantically equivalent models thenf semantically equivalent 
case uml daml mapping defined uml models necessary expressing daml ontologies partial mapping 
way mapping pair mappings second defined thenf defined vice versa 
assumption way mappings preserve semantics directions general way mappings inverses models defined 
best hope applying mappings successively stabilize hard achieve 
precise say way mapping stable model defined similarly models 
stability easier achieve invertibility strong property mappings 
stable way mapping 
model defined forms kind canonical form sense inverses canonical forms 
put way stable way mappings furnish languages invertible mappings canonical forms 
stability clearly desirable may necessary 
realistic goal way mapping settle eventually 
precise way mapping model defined sequence bounded 
desirable mappings bounded conflict desire keep mapping simple 
consider example mapping uml maps association daml class association daml property 
certainly necessary association classes nonbinary associations 
mapping uniformly associations certainly simpler treating binary associations association classes different manner 
doing unbounded 
binary association map class properties map back class associations map classes properties
