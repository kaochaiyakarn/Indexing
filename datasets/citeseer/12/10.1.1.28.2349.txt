currently comparing different implementations sub paths 
implementation provides sub paths distinctive element annotation

representation permits immediate visual location sub path markers consistent graphical representation markers easy specification sub paths path author 
second implementation permits embedding sub path content annotation 
responsibility distinguishing sub paths path author potential disadvantage

approach corresponds closely philosophy providing options path author embedding system implementation 
discussion directions initial focus walden paths project supporting teacher student discourse 
project matures interested investigating mechanism potential supporting communication direction student teacher 
perseus paths provides example paths context 
perseus paths student prepared artifact communicates student understanding topic form submitted instructor evaluation 
believe appropriate walden paths context broader environment information discovery analysis organization communication 
way perseus uses paths walden path substitute traditional term 
addition serve organizing framework class presentation information 
clear support broader goal requires significant additional thought design implementation 
general note project world wide web provides provocative environment conduct research 
strong opportunity exists web transfer results earlier hypertext research 
distributed unregulated heterogeneous nature web raises issues appear original environments homogeneous sense users sense software architecture 
interesting note heterogeneity web remains surprisingly dependent users support continuing technological survival 
infrastructure web appears depend adherence agreements primarily relying peer pressure enforcement
