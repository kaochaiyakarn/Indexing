suffer bronchitis concerned smoking may caused serious 
concerns founded smoking shown cause symptoms mentioned increase risk developing bronchitis 
shown increase risk getting serious heart disease cancer 
news know soon smoking health begins improve chances developing smoking related fall back normal 
soon notice considerable improvement cough get fewer chest infections 
late smoking years smoking health improve 
extracts letters smoker different experts ka effort centred conventional attempt create analyse corpus

knowledge acquisition planning aspect ka exercises knowledge acquire compiled information intentions underlying reasoning initially 
certainly information intentions reasoning obtained pure corpus analysis mentioned section probably dominant form ka current applied nlg efforts 
words corpus analysis tells developer expert 
develop systems schemas production rules case reasoning develop planning system reasons intentions ways fulfilling goals 
ka planning system heavily techniques structured discussions protocols provide insight reasoning intentions goals 
information provided usually complete 
instance paragraph think aloud protocol shown expert asserts mention letter symptoms health problems patient attributes smoking say simply repeat concerns go detail example smokers suffer bronchitis problem 
examine actual letter written expert shown part see case expert fact gone additional detail 
contrast expert go additional detail earlier letter discussing expense smoking calculating specific yearly cost 
building system schemas production rules consistently saw pattern corpus simply encode rule system give figures cost smoking smoking related health risks 
building proper intention planning system approach suffice need question expert determine gives figures cost health risks 
doing course produce robust useful system require non trivial amount ka 
case means atypical 
project obtained think aloud protocols organised structured discussions areas observe rules underlying rationale 
surprise human experts heavily rely compiled knowledge anderson 
course schedule additional ka sessions attempt understand rationale rules principle lead better letters 
engineering cost benefit perspective reiter mellish sense selectively cases think understanding rationale significantly improve letters insisting acquiring reasoning intentions rule extremely expensive 
words expense acquiring information intentions reasoning means practical perspective probably best mix deep plan reasoning shallower reasoning observed rules heuristics 

meeting ill defined goals rigorous domain theory related issue wish raise planning may difficult domains health goals ill defined strong underlying domain theory 
areas logistics clear goals move widgets underlying theory example know ship carry widgets take days get 
means ka activities domains concentrate high level rules 
need detailed ka domain theory provide rationale specified subgoals 
example ship capacity widgets need run ka sessions determine experts load ship widgets widgets widgets domain theory explains 
health domains contrast goals mathematically rigorous domain theory 
smoking letters project probably unusually clear goal get patient smoking compared goals reduce anxiety improve information exchange cawsey buchanan 
sub goals appeared ka sessions build empathy poorly defined 
fortunate smoking project psychological theory stages change gives guidance top level goal achieved goldstein theories 
stages change gives broad guidance attempt build detailed letter model theory successful see section 
problem health domains may goals interaction poorly understood 
example cawsey grasso point experts discuss explain potential side effects patients goals including helping patients cope side effects reducing anxiety overloading patients information 
furthermore goals conflict 
example telling patient cope extremely unpleasant unusual side effect helps achieving coping goal may detract anxiety reduction goal 
cawsey grasso point difficult incorporate program planning system deal goal conflicts especially poor understanding achieve goals individually 
words planning approach may especially difficult follow domains health medicine ill defined goals subgoals lack mathematically precise domain theory conflicting goals 
factors mean substantially ka required build planning system needed domain logistics precise goals rigorous domain theory
