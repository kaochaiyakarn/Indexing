keywords starfield display smooth zooming animation zoom bar dynamic queries information visualization focal line 
exploring large multi attribute databases greatly facilitated presenting information visually 
users dynamically query database filtering tools cause continuous visual updates rate frames second 
dynamic query applications typically encode multiattribute database items dots colored rectangles dimensional scatter gram called starfield display ordinal attributes items laid axes 
geographic applications arise natural candidates dynamic queries representing latitude longitude axes making starfield display map locations 
databases exploit starfield display mapping ordinal attributes axes third color code dots 
additional attributes controlled widgets sliders buttons 
applications employ visual information seeking vis principles facilitate rapid information browsing empower users find patterns exceptions glance :10.1.1.123.805
vis principles encompass direct manipulation rapid query filtering sliders buttons immediate continuous visual updates results tight coupling query components preserve display invariants zooming starfield display reduce clutter

deals design implementation zooming prototype dynamic queries application filmfinder 
zooming arbitrary image real time necessitates computations pixel zooming starfield display simpler problem computations done colored rectangles background just hundreds thousands rectangles opposed pixels 
prototype application prototype application substrate filmfinder figures visualization database movies 
film multiple attributes title director year release popularity lists actors length minutes category drama comedy horror rating 
film finder fully zoomed axis view showing films onwards 
starfield display formed plotting film small colored rectangle popularity scale popular axis year release axis 
popular movies appear top right starfield display 
categories color coded appear red rectangles musicals yellow database static movies old ones distribution data non uniform 
clicking rectangle pops information card lists attributes selected film shows picture 
number rectangles appear starfield display controlled selecting attributes films show just changing scale axes show films 
query filters implemented widgets toggles category rating alpha sliders title actors director range selection slider movie length new widget called zoom bar varying scale display axes 
global local effects varying attributes distinguish query filters local effects effects global 
example filters alpha slider selecting name actor affect small number display rectangles compared total number films database category toggles global effect terms large number films affect large display area changes take place 
zooming action changes scale display axes forcing redisplay rectangles scale change filter global effect filter 
classification attributes global effect local effect ones highly application dependent 
example query display films directors names supported director classified global effect attribute 
changes global effect attributes take longer time render special data storage access techniques designed speed display refresh rate 
zooming mechanism zooming done changing range attributes axis individually upper limit years continuously decreased scale axis keeps increasing 
rectangles representing movies keep leaving display ones range grow size move display range occupies entire width starfield looking patterned rubber mat getting stretched 
hand varying non axis attributes category film length causes rectangles drop starfield get added scaling movement involved 
taxonomy zooming methods image zoomed continuously discrete steps 
zooming discrete steps employed substantial computations involved drawing new view zooming arbitrary picture gained doing continuous zoom changing view size text desktop publishing application 
continuous zooming important give user feel flying space say world graphical objects virtual reality applications information visualization starfield display 
allows users get detail areas intense interest preserve sense location surrounding items 
continuous zooming requires rapid image consist simple objects hierarchically structured 
difficult arbitrary image 
way classifying zooming effects entire image 
zooming methods typically lens moved image 
magnified portion appears lens boundaries separate window rest image stays undistorted 
case sharp discontinuity boundaries users need mentally integrate views 
window application viewing postscript files uses lens magic lens 
fisheye lens selected object magnified surrounding objects progressively diminished size giving perspective view retains focus context 
fisheye views free user burden mentally integrating discontinuous pictures retain information screen making look cluttered 
third type zooming changes scale display axes causing information leave enter viewing area 
changes amount information viewed focus area changing focus area size identified canonical adjust operation 
advantage screen done big discrete jumps user feel disoriented 

partially zoomed view showing films zoom methods done continuously discrete jumps depending complexity image 
filmfinder uses third methods continuous manner 
figures show successive views starfield display zooming done axis decreasing upper range boundary films year release 

zoomed view showing films purpose zooming zooming information visualization display twin purposes 
images hierarchy oriented diagrams network node link diagrams successive views reveal previously hidden detail 
example node node link diagram network may function icon sub network zooming reveal details sub network node link diagram rung lower hierarchy networks termed semantic zooming 
zooming akin magnifying image selected point 
zooming reduce visual clutter filtering data points lie outside new zoom range 
filmfinder uses zooming achieve effect 
due zooming rectangles overlapped partially zoomed view get spread apart making easier click 
zooming realistic rectangles change size zoomed change bounded prevent shrinking growing occupy large part screen 
easier select larger rectangle smaller amount zoom gauged looking size rectangles 
zooming trickier panning objects translate amount changing size zoomed objects change size move different amounts depending distance focus 
means zooming extensive geometrical recomputations panning 
amount translation zoomed rectangle direction function current range boundaries making impractical precompute increments store lookup table 
zoom bar existing zoom widgets user lens tools suited applications zooming takes place jumps small image areas don zooming continuous entire screen triggered changes range boundary 
initiating zoom mouse button works wish zoom away fixed point interface obvious user screen widget provide visual cue 
disadvantage method feedback users degree zooming current display 
tried pair buttons increasing decreasing range boundary buttons proved confusing users unsure button decreased increased boundary hard see link changing range boundary concomitant zooming effect 
overcame deficiency developing new widget called zoom bar see slider thumbs 
extreme thumbs adjust range boundaries 
right thumb moved upper range boundary increased decreased causing zoom zoom changing scale corresponding display axis 
similarly left thumb controls lower range 
middle thumb pan display range 
size varies positions left right thumbs changing width window pans data 
year film release 
zoom bar viewing range varied sliding thumbs 
panning done middle thumb 
middle thumb minimum width means left right thumbs come close specified separation 
separation defines maximum zoom view 
thumbs opposite ends slider view fully zoomed middle button disabled 
scale display axes varied individually zoom bar 
zoom bar clicked channel position thumb thumb closest clicked point snaps location 
causes jump range values results discrete zooming 
strengths weaknesses zoom bar intuitive easy similarity scrollbar 
occupies small rectangular area saving precious screen space operation rapid small size 
zoom bar provides clear feedback degree zooming current display 
suited continuous discrete zooming panning sliding fixed range data 
scope restricted display dimension time 
alternative camera model single axis time zooming prototype application described terms camera focal point 
section describes alternative model 
traditional continuous zoom techniques give users impression flying perpendicular plane starfield display plane fixed point novel zooming technique gives impression rubber carpet getting stretched contracted user standing fixed distance 
fundamental difference arises zooming scheme provides independently zoom factors axes 
different zooming techniques described view seen camera variable focal length position changed 
traditional zoom techniques employ possible schemes 
camera stays fixed place focal length changes time real camera camera field view remains fixed camera moves away fixed point 
case starfield display rectangles appear move away focal point directions zooming appear converge focal point zoom shown 

zooming causes rectangles move radially outward focal point 
contrast zooming filmfinder done independently directions single focal point 
focal line corresponding range boundary remains fixed 
line sides starfield display 
example zooming done horizontal direction upper range increased focal line left side display 
rectangles lie close left boundary move small amounts compared ones near right boundary rectangles shrink amount 
range increases rectangles enter viewing range right start moving leftwards 
shows behavior 
words rectangles flatten move focal line move away 
traditional zooming technique user defined focal point interest absence additional overview screen user may feel lost zooming smooth 
individual axis zooming user view firmly anchored sides starfield display 
conjecture leads better grasp location improved user satisfaction 
focal line range expanded
