sketch interface sketch interfaces organized gestures drawings produced pen digitizing tablet 
individual gestures drawing commands identified shape recognizer 
appendix lists figures gestures supported recognizer 
drawing commands create solid primitives combination gestures specified order semantics create sketching solids der draw circle line staring center circle 
define syntax visual language create threedimensional drawing primitives executing commands exemplified 
size shapes length lines sketched define attributes new primitives created height width rotation position translates significant savings commands interactions compared conventional approaches 
call feature calligraphic iconic input 
grouping solids gesture editor supports creation simple solids cubes spheres cylinders cones prisms pyramids just sketching combinations gestures 
main attributes solids defined created need invoke usual boring menus 
sets operations performed solids copying deleting changing color cutting applying textures grouping natural intuitive gestures perform operations usually bearing close mnemonic relation semantics operations mind 
example hand drawn signify copy command representing operation issue grouping command 
way wasting time searching options menus trying remember shortcuts just sketch commands 
furthermore sketch commands go bit direct manipulation techniques implicitly select solid apply operation see fig 

see gestures expressive conventional commands specify action performed additional arguments geometry attributes object objects action performed single interaction 
expressiveness gestures sketches better match drawing type applications conventional direct manipulation environments syntax interface gets way 
editor allows creating threedimensional surfaces free hand creating deforming surface dimensional contours 
specifying contour modify surfaces deform pulling points depicted 
cut surfaces drawing cutting line application fractal method emulate real terrain 
undo destructive operations applied solids surfaces delete cut drawing cross object illustrated 
cutting surfaces undoing 
implementation details editor developed ms windows 
cali library recognizing commands primitives 
opengl graphics library opengl utility toolkit woo create display graphical objects simplify direct manipulation commands picking resizing dimensional objects 
creating deforming surfaces uses delaunay triangulation describe adjacencies maintain surface consistency 
super delaunay library support operations 

usability study measure advantages disadvantages editor usability study involving users experience domain 
divided users groups tablet built display simple tablet 
groups experimental procedure 
answer written inquiry define vocabulary calligraphic domain 
want notice users previous contact application 
second phase get users acquainted editor conventional editor compare 
third ask users perform set steps lead clear values allowing withdrawal results 
answer second written inquiry asked compare model application grade set items 
study allows extraction results different kinds number errors time spent operation users feedback grades set items intuitiveness simplicity operations offered 

results analysis questionnaire revealed users quite unanimous way represent simple solids 
test uncovered interesting results 
instance users times errors simple tablet 
interesting result gain experience editor 
users take time create delete objects experience 
noticed creation surfaces tablet display far time consuming conventional methods 
comparing editor map building tool bsp shows better regular scenes oriented axes 
editor user preference far global intuitiveness concerned 
second inquiry revealed users appreciated generality supported operations simplicity sketch edition 
revealed problems solve better navigation method camera implementation spatial constraint satisfaction techniques easy process combining objects scene 

seen results quite users revealed satisfied generality aspects concerning calligraphic model editor particular 
items blurring results naturally lead desirable new functionality inclusion restriction satisfaction algorithms inclusion simultaneous views solve lack threedimensional assistance
