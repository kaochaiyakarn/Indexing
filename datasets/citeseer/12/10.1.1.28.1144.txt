computer theater view providing means enhance artistic possibilities experiences professional amateur actors audiences clearly engaged representational role performance 
classification interactive computer music systems proposed rowe interesting starting point understanding possibilities computer theater 
rowe classifies music systems dimensions naturally extend systems 
particularly important analysis rowe differentiation player instrument paradigms interactive music systems 
classification propose categorization computer theater systems categories hyper actors computer actors computerized stages 
hyper actors rowe classifies interactive musical system instrument paradigm basic concern construct extended musical instrument 
instance project led tod machover mit media laboratory musical instruments built sense musician gestures enabling control modulate computerized counterpart acoustic sound produced instrument 
actor instrument body including voice facial expression actors able control bodies extraordinary different ways 
centuries actors relied masks alter bodies extreme case 
suggest term hyper actor denote computer theater systems aim enhance actor body expressive capabilities 
hyper actor expands actor body able trigger lights sounds images stage screen control final appearance public image voice mediated computer expand sensor capabilities receiving information video goggles control physical devices cameras parts set robots theater machinery 
idea explored dance music theater 
body suits wired sensors having widely explored works examples include performances laurie anderson involving processing voice singing george coates experimentation actors receiving script internet users live performance better bad news christopher performances musician dancer played sound heartbeats possibility having actor stage providing means control physical appearance image audience 
mark virtual theater curious illustration concept 
typical scene actor stage plays stage actor image seen audience large stereo graphic video screens audience wears special goggles 
stage actor image expands contracts play events symbolize enrich power struggle portrayed scene 
computer actors player paradigm interactive music systems corresponds situations intention build artificial player musical presence personality behavior 
computer theater realm player paradigm corresponds computer actor computer program assumes role characters play 
computer displays characters actions sort output device video screens monitors speakers physical devices 
distinction hyper computer actors important computer actors require control system decides independently desires human partners 
computer actor able follow script react role issues decision control expressiveness relevant case hyper actors 
contrast hyper acting bad connotation term require better sensing understanding human performer actions 
straightforward implementation computer actors human characters displayed stage screen 
interesting examples come research oriented direct user interaction computer generated characters 
worth mention bruce blumberg building computer graphics generated dog interacts user obeying simple gestural commands sit catch ball satisfying agenda necessities drink water 
interaction occurs large video screen simulates mirror user dog occupy space

particularly modes possibilities hardly addressed past current computer theater systems instance case computer actors script systems 
rehearsal vs performance ensemble key part artistic process theater 
compared music ensemble rehearsal process theater longer richer experimentation 
characters usually built interaction actors stage supervision guidance director 
performing bad actor bad bad actor quite worse 
limited actor rehearsal creative process 
importance rehearsal major point computer theater experiments far inadequately addressed especially case 
view biggest challenges computer theater build hyper computer actors actively respond variations staging www mic atr jp guide stanford edu people curtis html script discovered proposed rehearsal time human actors director 
computer actors require action representation recognition performance computer actors 
scripts rowe distinguishes score performance driven computer music map concepts scripted improvisational computer theater 
scripted computer theater systems supposed follow totally partially sequence actions described script 
performance system synchronizes going action script giving back lines determined rehearsal process interestingly line mode director 
improvisational theater relies defined characters situations 
type computer theater immediate connections research developing characters computer games software agents 
distinction actor situation game agents interest creatures major source dramatic conflict improvisation setting characters unexpected situations environments 
important fact improvisation requires recognition intentions 
knowing character wants enables interesting rich behavior 
resulting piece flat structurally resembling dialogue animal sense immediacy dictates actions 
interesting notice initial research interactive computer music concerned score driven systems computer theater steering improvisation interest interactive spaces computer games 
performers users experiments building interactive computer characters targeted non actors people unfamiliar computerized environment space 
case computer music fundamental concern provide tools people musical training 
development ideas methods concretely engage users important believe fundamental concentrate efforts understanding reacting actors audience performance situation 
important reason users boring action point view 
users motivated curiosity repertoire displayed actions reactions normally restricted 
hard develop performance people committed engage street performers know 
system assuming non engaged users rely story telling techniques create interesting environment 
theater general performance go story telling assuming performers audience know engaged roles 
galyean interactive narrative interesting example user navigates virtual world coerces watch story 
point narrative user central character plot 
great deal control embedded program assure engagement user user pay attention key events repeated story includes moments designed attract attention instance car crash front virtual user 
immersive story telling environments galyean require different techniques interaction audience users relying interactive narrative action dramatic structure 
view user oriented computer theater systems concerned provision true experiences transforming user performer actor director 
trivial example performance experience style system user interacts computer actor front audience interactive shakespeare built michael interesting possibility giving user experience acting sense building character living intensively situation 
rehearsal games rewarding aspects theater craft 
computer music similar issue addressed new generation hyper instruments built tod machover aimed interaction sophisticated systems instruments intuitive natural possible general public 
eliminate necessity concentration skill imagination challenging mental interfaces computer theater action certainly possible computer theater system just produces output pre determined pre timed computer script 
soon performance starts computer generates output list timed cues determined precisely rehearsal 
human actors especially adjust performances situations results expected devoid richness life 
computer theater worthwhile hyper follows actions human partners adjusts reactions accordingly 
case scripted theater computer system recognize actions performed human actors match information script 
conceive minimal system detailed list sensory inputs corresponding outputs 
list provided manually director technical assistants performance computer system just matches listed sensory inputs generates pre determined output 
simple system just described hard implement practice due noisy sensors performance variability believe interesting japanese literally means empty orchestra appropriate word mean empty role empty actor 
see description pg 

media mit edu growth approach computer theater action understanding 
providing computer actor cryptic list sensor reaction mappings challenge input actions reactions determined textually script director 
textual description actions corresponding human part analyzed computer producing visual auditory components detected sensory routines see 
hand hyper computer actor actions script directly generate low level instructions computer graphics external physical devices see 
view computer actor instructed words shout able recognize automatically action described simply actor walks chair 
positive feature action verbal descriptions precisely vagueness 
description actor walks chair specify actor comes path taken highlights final destination enabling actor explore different ways performing recognition system 
similarly describing computer actor actions textual mode provides room reactive mechanisms rehearsal performance time 
instruction computer shouts back translated fixed volume level volume proportional current scene sound level 
action description scenes employed describe structure improvisational systems advantages recognition actions complicated lack pre determined ordering 
mentioned implement improvisational computer actors necessary deal recognition intentions actions human actor 
example escape sketch necessary recognize actor moving room trying escape exit intends 
perceptual recognition intentions hardly explored believe constitutes major challenge design interesting improvisational computer actors 
computer theater domain action understanding action approach appropriate computer theater believe computer theater domain research action understanding 
action basic underlying foundation theater specific characteristics activity provide range interesting elements ai research action 
simplest analysis easy see gestures employed actors explicit determined ordinary human activity 
instance holding glass important actor sure audience notices glass picked 
theater naturally provides wider range gestures postures situations normal life 
actions theater staged member audience see minuscule gestures rarely 
visual action recognition employ long shot wide angle cameras correspond audience field view avoiding problems having different image resolution needs plague instance building action recognizer office space 
interesting deeper reasons theater domain action understanding 
theater defines clear defined contexts provide natural limits reasoning recognition processes 
context described script basic repertoire sequence actions movements actors 
mechanics dramatic text attention driven actions performers quite rarely non human caused events 
greatest hope computer theater enable action research start tackling hard issue intentionality 
theater intentions translated physical activity including voice punctuation intonation joint effort director actors rehearsal 
traditionally director analyses text assigns intentional actions parts script general objectives different characters see chapter part iv 
rehearsal actors guided find physical activities correspond intention characters process involves relating context personal experience 
resulting activities loaded explicit intentional elements design 
theater enables assume action intentional result conflict character objectives actors actions 
terms intentions expected explicit activity creating situations relationships intention action physical activity easier study model 
action representation recognition generation argued computer theater domain investigate action representation recognition 
section briefly survey current state research action representation recognition generation 
representation representing actions object research linguistics computer graphics computer vision 
research struggling traditional ai problems context common sense reasoning 
part ph research prof aaron bobick mit media laboratory representation scheme developed schank conceptualizations called action frames 
research considers domain tv cooking shows applied development automatic cameras tv studios 
extend naturally computer theater camera control system designed independent general system uses understands actions script cooking show 
part current research efforts focused designing better representation actions 
debating convenience schank primitives describe action 
action frames need augmented incorporating visual elements time possibly allen interval algebra 
important element missing representation system mechanism specify intensity action 
computer theater purposes difference talking crucial 
recognition research visual action recognition restricted recognizing human body movements 
works examined issues related understanding actions effects world 
bruce blumberg dog mentioned uses recognition capabilities alive react commands pointing sitting catch ball 
limited vocabulary precise context enables translation hand positions directly actions extended arm ground means sitting independently actual shape hand direction sight 
aaron bobick conducting research unpublished addressing visual action recognition 
key idea proposal represent time constraints allen interval algebra enabling vaguely specified relationships actions sub actions visual features 
visual features obtained dictionary action verbs translates actions script information features detectable visual routines 
recognition displayed emotional states determine appropriate reaction computer actor 
describes recognition human facial expressions 
case hyper actors detection true emotional states control augmented body 
affective states addressed picard mit direct sensing body variables blood pressure heartbeat 
hard predict techniques performance rehearsal displaying emotions precisely controlled actor 
speech recognition simple way synchronize performance scripts matching spoken words lines script 
improvisational theater necessary go step add understanding capabilities system 
dimension voice expression emotions recognition research case 
generation significant amount incorporate action computer graphics examples 
perlin particularly interesting computer actor receives commands directly action verbs 
synthesis facial expressions human computer characters received significant attention computer graphics community 
typical example modeling facial muscles tissue enables variety facial expressions 
speech synthesizers commercially available ability generate expression modulated speech subject research
