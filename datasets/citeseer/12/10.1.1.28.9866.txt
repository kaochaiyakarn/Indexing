eureka confusion hidden labels 
attributes eureka vertically aligned room attribute labels data say dimensions 
case users troubles making sense data finding attributes need attribute labels top columns largely hidden see 
difficulties attributes 
eureka users considerable troubles solving problems involved attributes 
hidden variable names problems decoding color codes finding right filtering grouping strategies 
errors correlation questions 
eureka users troubles answering questions correctly involved correlations attributes despite training received regard 
forgot sort attributes involved interpret diverging converging graphs indicators negative correlation 

infozoom erroneously seeing correlations 
infozoom subjects troubles determining correlation exists different attributes different reasons eureka 
reason narrow row height compressed view difficult ascertain fluxes data

discussion empirical studies visualization systems tasks relatively simple bound structure underlying data 
examples include searching objects property specifying attributes object performing count tasks 
tasks subjects regarded representative typical operations users perform visualizations 
keeping tasks simple easier attribute differences task performance directly different types visualization helps eliminate confounding factors 
drawback studies low level tasks unclear ecological relevance frequently lowlevel tasks occur real world tasks significant task solution process 
usability studies visualization systems employ complex tasks come closer realworld tasks study factors may influence observed outcomes studies low level tasks 
factors include users understanding tasks ability translate available visualizations operations visualizations problem realworld visualization systems exist visualizations solution paths problems 
careful analysis users solved task comparison similar tasks possible incrementally separate significant factors probably significant ones 
experiments far show success visualization system depends factors including ones 

properties visualization instance different charts available spotfire visualize dimensions normally contained datasets 
users plan advance variables represented 
planning performed assistance visualization takes considerable time 

operations performed visualization 
infozoom allows zooming operations turned successful users 
zooming realized eureka system allows context preserving operations exception filtering users difficult employ problems comprised attributes 

concrete implementation visualization paradigm 
eureka infozoom offer table visualization attributes aligned vertically eureka horizontally infozoom 
hand current computer screens practically oriented landscape mode 
result height infozoom rows smaller width eureka columns reason info zoom users troubles seeing correlations eureka users 
columns eureka far small able display letters variable names variables 
eureka users encountered considerable orientation problems 

visualization independent usability problems 
spotfire offers visualizations shows scatterplot representation default 
spotfire users representation unable give difficulties representing problem 
advantages system respect factor may easily outweighed deficiencies respect factors 
results geographical tasks suggest superior expressiveness visualization case spotfire tasks outweighed impeding factors 
plan investigate hypotheses concrete connect low level tasks studied
