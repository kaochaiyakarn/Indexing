decision identifies alternative decision maker believes prove alternative actions 
standard answer ideal decisions 
variant decision theories touched provide different answers calling decision identifies alternative decision maker considers alternatives deliberation 

formalize evaluation decisions 
decisions formally characterized actions maximize expected utility notion involving belief goodness 
decision theory develops notion stages 
stand set actions alternatives 
decision theory presumes association set outcomes action 
actions theory says little nature outcomes range long short intervals time factors determine association leaving decision analyst decide things 
omega stand set outcomes identified actions union associated action 
second theory presumes measure outcome value assigns utility 
outcome omega gamma theory requires outcomes identified determinate value utility context decision consideration ensure single outcome come ways differ value 
requirement theory takes outcomes refinements matter model decision 
third theory presumes measure probability outcomes conditional actions pr ja denoting probability outcome comes action situation consideration

pr ja 
decision theory defines rational decision makers maximize expected utility 
states orthodox account approaches employ non probabilistic notions belief different notions worth criteria expected utility maximization 

formulate decision problem confronting decision maker 
identifies alternatives outcomes probabilities utilities iterative process hypothesizing testing refining sequence tentative formulations 
identifies alternatives outcomes direct queries knowledge circumstances 
intervene situation 
evaluate success intervention assesses probabilities utilities direct queries think outcome willing pay outcome indirectly inferring patterns hypothetical choices 
indirect approach exploits fundamental theorems decision theory showing certain patterns uniquely determine probabilities utilities 
particular savage representation theorem provides isomorphism rational preferences uncertain outcomes quantitative representations terms expected utility 
repeatedly improves tentative identifications alternatives outcomes probabilities utilities evaluating completeness consistency conceptual convenience sensitivity errors assessment relation intuitive judgments 
complicated cases may require iterations substantial analytical effort obtain satisfactory decision formulation 
central questions means exhaust important practical philosophical issues 
philosophical criticisms utility approaches decisions go back debate late eighteenth early nineteenth centuries 
include doubts existence universal currency reconciling different sorts goods see instance chapter possibility estimating outcomes actions especially long periods times possibility defining legitimate measure group welfare especially context actions change membership group welfare stake 
issues arise automated decision making recall traditional philosophical questions locate debate new setting focusing need efficient reasoning complex decision making cases arise human affairs 
quantitative representations probability utility procedures computing representations provide adequate framework manual treatment simple decision problems successful complicated realistic cases

revision preferences developing satisfactory theory decision capable providing account rational preference revision generally rational guidelines decision theoretic reasoning novel circumstances requires foundational 
scarcity devoted rational revision preferences remarkable view attention paid rational belief revision analogies belief preference see instance

attitudes dissipate quickly topic turns planning acting novel circumstances forms requirement circumscribed robots human proxies 
novel circumstances call creating preferences prior revising refining 
example finding oneself living travelling strange town necessary re invent preferences needed everyday life 
daily shopping decisions instance require standing preferences shop brands buy 
shopping preferences previous life apply automatically new circumstances different stores different selections goods shelves 
cases theoreticians refer high level standing goals goal lead life 
rarely say reasoning lead uninformative general goals specific preferences needed daily activities 
generic preferences offer natural informative starting point reasoning 
generic preference instance food stores minimize driving time minimize cost provide sort specific guidance needed shopping decisions 
course created fashion specific preferences require revision light experience 
interprets goals generic preferences lines standard deliberative methods subgoaling constitute reasoned adoption abandonment preferences
