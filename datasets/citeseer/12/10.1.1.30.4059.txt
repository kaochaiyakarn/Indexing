primary concern research investigate ways team fact similar aggregate agent extent previous individual intention carried joint case 
continue earlier development argue notion joint intention formulated joint commitment perform collective action certain shared mental state glue binds team members 
achieve degree realism required successful autonomous behaviour model individual agents situated dynamic multi agent world possessing complete correct beliefs having changeable goals fallible actions subject interruption external events 
furthermore assume beliefs goals agents need known agents agents start state certain beliefs goals shared situation change time passes 
potential divergence mental state clearly complicates task 
limit cases agent knew doing instance considering joint actions performed publicly simpler see collection agents behave single agent relevant beliefs shared 
hand precisely potential divergence joint activity agents necessarily operate lock step mutually tension trying keep team acting unit 
primary goal research isto discover hold team allowing members arrive private beliefs status shared activity 
words willing assume progressing smoothly shared activity concerned cases example agents longer belief agent intends share 
divergence agents communication necessary 
model individual intention earlier su cient show communicative acts de ned terms beliefs intentions achieve various goals perspective individual agent constraining rational balance agents maintain beliefs goals commitments intentions actions 
special communicative demands placed agents involved joint activities wish examine arise function general constraints team behaviour 
looking example sort joint activity wehave mind possible speci cations underlying team behaviour brie list questions expect theory address addition cited joint intentions leading individual ones said ultimately agents act beliefs goals intentions 
joint beliefs goals intentions teams lead individuals gets done 
typically teams involved joint activities consist parts performed concurrently sequence 
joint intentions perform complex actions lead appropriate intentions perform pieces 
assuming agent intend actions attitude share 
functional role joint intentions bratman argued case individuals intentions play certain functional roles pose problems agents solved means analysis rule adoption intentions con ict existing ones dispose agents monitor attempts achieve barring major changes tend persist 
roles analogues teams 
communication required theory joint action indicate communication necessary 
agents need know activity part agents shares 
agents communicate joint action agent turn joint action nished joint action longer needed 
communication facilitate monitoring joint intentions 
convoy example team behaviour coordinated individual behaviour 
question best answered considering happen case convoy example right sort joint intention 
suppose agents alice bob bob wants go home know way knows alice going near know way 
clearly alice bob bob get home bob need follow alice 
circumstances plan quite adequate 
problems 
example alice decide drive quickly tra bob may unable keep 
better bob point view alice knew intended follow nds way counting fact alice kind soul plan keeping sight 
say bob arranges carl tell going 
assuming disposed speed away 
reason know bob sent carl 
far concerned bob know knows 
particular expect bob signal knows way 
example bob starts having car trouble needs pull alice may speed believing 
realizing possibility bob try get 
get carl tell alice bob asked carl talk alice 
ensure alice aware fact bob knew told 
assuming goes point bob alice appropriate intentions know intentions know knew intentions 
room misunderstanding 
alice say carl told bob sent talk bob knows know driving plans 
know carl mentioned bob sent 
think carl just decided spot say bob doesn realize know 
bob knows know driving plans thinks accidentally thinks won expect signal nds way 
reasoning happen course alice speed bob runs car trouble 
fact situation slightly worse incorrect reasoning take place bob believe want pull fear misunderstood 
clearly kind robustness expects convoy 
point driving precisely able deal better problems occur en route 
kind misunderstanding place go deeper levels due fact parties right intentions right beliefs level lack mutual belief agreed 
suggests bob approach alice directly get agree convoy agreement common knowledge parties 
precise exactly means stage think rough rst proposal concept joint intention property hold group shared activity 
words expect agents rst form directed joint intentions act keep joint intentions time jointly act 
proposal 
jointly intend collective action mutually known intend collective action occur mutually known intend share long theirs 
discuss section proposed literature 
assuming tight connection intention commitment guarantee agents commit achieving goal 
common knowledge committed way party change mind desirability activity 
addition assume hidden obstacles parties share bob get home 
strong assumptions speci cation weak allow divergence mental states 
see consider appropriate reasons dropping participation convoy rst bob come realize knows way intended action successfully terminated second alice realize know bob lives intended action performed 
assume case agent question choice give intention act terminating convoy 
problem bob alice driving alice may come believe bob knows way convoy speed bob may come believe alice know way plan get home way 
party comes erroneous suspect similar happening convoy fall apart 
parties right intentions start right mutual knowledge prevent mutual knowledge doubt enters agent private beliefs regarding status activity 
potential troubles expect joint activity 
precisely problem rst proposal guarantees goals intentions persist suitably time guarantee mutual knowledge goals intentions persist 
second proposal proposal 
jointly intend action mutually known intend collective action occur intend share long likewise mutual knowledge persists mutually known activity successful unachievable irrelevant 
certainly strong rule doubt induced unraveling team ort parties know exactly stand arrive understanding done 
trouble speci cation allowing divergence mental states strong 
see suppose point alice comes realize privately know bob lives 
intention lead bob home untenable point longer mutual belief parties engaged activity 
involved joint intention proposal meant keeping intention mutually believed 
circumstances mutually believed led counterintuitive really joint intention start 
speci cation strong stipulates outset agents mutually believe respective intentions mutually known 
allow private beliefs activity terminated successfully unachievable 
section propose precisely third speci cation joint intention lies strength avoids drawbacks 
roughly speaking consider agent thinking execution shared activity agent normal case agent discovered reason
