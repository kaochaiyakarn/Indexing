explanation gases mix conditions described entropy increase deltas nr log independent nature gases 
gases identical mix entropy increase 
bear mind 
say gases mix entropy increases mean gases separated brought back original states means leave changes external bodies 
external changes consist example lowering weight transfer heat hot body cold 
original state mean molecule returned original position state indistinguishable original macroscopic properties observing 
require molecule originally returns words mean recover original thermodynamic state defined example specifying chemical composition total energy volume number gas 
states system incompletely defined propositions thermodynamics relate 
say identical gases mix change entropy mean molecules originally returned external change 
assertion thermodynamics net entropy change zero original thermodynamic state recovered external change 
reinsert observed macroscopic properties mixed gases identical change thermodynamic state 
follows change entropy thermodynamic function 
trying interpret phenomenon discontinuous change physical nature gases behavior microstates exactly misses point 
principles thermodynamics refer properties hypothesized microstates observed properties macrostates thought restoring original microstate 
put gases exactly discontinuity mean words restore reversible 
considerations explain mixtures gases different footing reduce significance fact entropy change gases independent nature gases 
may doing violence general principles thermodynamics imagine gases presently known appear limit resemblance deltas independent 
may imagine gases absolutely identical properties come play exist gases diffusion cell differ behavior environment 
mixing increase entropy take place process dynamically considered absolutely identical details precise path atom process take place increase entropy 
respects entropy stands strongly contrasted energy 
thermodynamic state defined specifying small number macroscopic quantities pressure volume temperature magnetization stress denote fx observed controlled experimenter seldom greater 
may contrast physical state microstate imagine positions velocities individual atoms specified 
thermodynamic functions particular entropy definition construction properties thermodynamic state 
thermodynamic variable may may property microstate 
consider total mass total energy physically real properties microstate considerations show entropy 
emphasize note thermodynamic state denoted fx defines large class microstates compatible boltzmann planck einstein showed may interpret entropy macrostate log phase volume occupied microstates chosen class formula large mass correct results may explained deduced neat natural way jaynes 
particular simple explanation reason second law immediate consequence liouville theorem generalization second law nonequilibrium conditions useful applications biology jaynes 
interesting implications generally recognized 
thermodynamic entropy definition construction property microstate certain class microstates measure size class 
different microstates ascribe entropy systems microstates 
possible experimenters assign different entropies fact microstate sense position velocity atom error 
contemplating different set possible macroscopic observations system embedding microstate different classes important follow 
place necessary decide outset problem macroscopic variables degrees freedom shall measure control context thermodynamic system defined entropy function variables chosen 
expect obey second law tds dq long experimental manipulations confined chosen set 
unknown vary outside set produce appear violation second law entropy function decrease spontaneously increases 
demonstrate explicitly 
secondly chosen set deviations second law conceivable 
return mixing identical gases 
fact mix change entropy conclude separated external change 
contrary separation identical gases entirely impossible external change 
identical means means way unmixing apparatus determine molecule came originally short having followed entire trajectory 

discussion follows fortiori way accomplish separation manipulation fx happen intervention part course motion molecules came return time 
event impossible consider improbable 
separation nature accomplish case identical molecules surely accomplish easily ones 
spontaneous separation mixed gases just possible ones 
words impossibility decrease entropy reduced 

discussion sentence famous boltzmann quoted years reply zermelo took second volume uber 
note superiority gibbs reasoning 
interchange identical particles real physical event troubled writers including schrodinger 
see strong contrast physical nature energy anthropomorphic nature entropy understood gibbs 
see attempts explain irreversibility searching entropy function supposed property microstate making second law theorem dynamics consequence equations motion 
attempts dating back boltzmann succeeded ceased 
quite unnecessary second law clausius gave statement property microstates 
difference deltas mixing gases paradoxical supposes erroneously entropy property microstate 
important constructive point emerges thermodynamics greater flexibility useful applications generally recognized 
experimenter liberty choose wishes chooses set experimentally reproducible connections equation state entropy appropriate chosen set satisfy second law correctly accounts macroscopic observations experimenter manipulating set 
may draw range validity second law 
place entropy depend particular way decide define thermodynamic states obviously statement entropy tends increase decrease remain valid long having choice stick choice 
soon boltzmann log reason second law seen immediately proposition macroscopic phenomenology true simply considerations phase volume 
thermodynamic states slightly different entropy gamma gamma cal deg corresponding room temperature exhibit phase volume ratio exp gamma exp macrostates higher entropy said occupy overwhelmingly greater phase volumes put accurately macrostates higher entropy may realized overwhelmingly greater number range microstates 
reproducible changes equilibrium thermodynamic states overwhelming majority macrostate changes possibly occur equilibrium nonequilibrium ones higher entropy simply overwhelmingly microstates go factors 
see needed understand second law fact macroscopic phenomenology 
argument just showing entropy depends microstate human choice class embedded may appear leaves reader doubt describing real concrete facts particular philosophy interpretation physical consequences 
particularly recall aforementioned boltzmann spent remaining years life inner outward controversy second law repeatedly changing position 
details klein 
degenerated nit picking arguments exact conditions function decrease 
settled related real experimental facts second law velocity distribution 
sure similar course 
fortunately concrete reality direct experimental relevance gibbs arguments easily shown 
actual calculation probably common elementary textbooks full conditions validity best knowledge recognized 
scenario set slightly discovery nearly realization 
examination textbooks shows discovery prompted great deal confusion entropy mixing included thermodynamics 

gas mixing scenario revisited 
presumably doubts today measurable macroscopic properties argon equation state heat capacity vapor pressure heat described correctly conventional thermodynamics ascribes zero entropy change mixing samples argon temperature pressure 
suppose unknown today different kinds argon identical respects soluble rare elements fact rare discovered 
discovery century shall way preparing argon different proportions 
rare chance happen get pure volume pure way knowing detecting difference resulting diffusion process

gas mixing scenario revisited 
school thought rejects attempts point close relation entropy information claiming considerations energy entropy subjective experimental facts 
observe number fish catch objective experimental fact depends subjective information behavior fish 
things depend human information grounds subjective science education fields human information 
misuse terms subjective objective descriptive adjectives 
science seek describe objectively real hypotheses testable consequences describe human observers see know 
lesson learned relativity theory 
amount useful extract system depends obviously necessarily subjective information microstate tells interactions extract energy paradox 
entropy ascribe macrostate represent kind human information underlying microstates perform thermodynamic function determining amount extracted macrostate 
obvious easily demonstrated scenario 
diffusion take place change temperature pressure internal energy greater information shall associate free energy decrease deltaf gammat deltas principles thermodynamics allowing uncontrolled irreversible mixing carry change state reversibly able obtain gamma deltaf deltas place movable piston 
removed diffuse piston partial pressure sides move piston slowly maintain equal pressure allow heat flow maintain constant temperature direction increasing expansion shall obtain dv rt log deltas term deltas entropy mixing indicates obtainable reversible expansion component full volume initial diffusion represents irreversible entropy increase deltas obtain 
spurred partial success element discovered opposite property 
apparatus moves right giving deltas moves left yielding deltas succeeded extracting just deltas predicted thermodynamics 
entropy mixing represent human information just information needed predict available mixing 
scenario greater knowledge resulting discovery elements leads assign different entropy change may fact identical physical process exact path atom 
greater knowledge corresponds exactly due greater capabilities control physical process 
possession piston gives ability control new thermodynamic degree freedom position piston 
astonishing new technical capability enable extract useful system 
scenario illustrated aforementioned greater versatility thermodynamics wider range useful applications get recognizing strong contrast natures entropy energy gibbs pointed long ago

may ascribe zero entropy mixing shall predict correctly just done th century thermodynamic measurements argon new technology 
discovery elements rules thermodynamics valid correctly describe measurements possible manipulating set chosen 
useful versatility direct result illustration anthropomorphic nature entropy apparent believed thought entropy energy physical property microstate 

second law 
scenario verified statement person knows new degree freedom manipulates play tricks know think seeing violation second law 
suppose observers know elements experiments 
experiment mixing volume takes place spontaneously initial thermodynamic state final change temperature pressure internal energy doing causes heat flow diffusion cell surrounding heat bath temperature observers initial final states heat bath ignorant observer true argon happens 
experiment insert perform mixing reversibly starting initial state final state argon temperature pressure internal energy done heat flows diffusion cell heat bath

ignorant observer amount heat extracted heat bath converted entirely total entropy system heat bath decreased spontaneously deltas gammaq violation second law

change total entropy entire process experiment reversible 
move back slowly original positions 
give back argon returned original condition heat returned heat bath 
observers turn thinking see violation second law third better informed knows composed components element ad infinitum 

pauli analysis physical system macroscopic degrees freedom control observe manipulating see apparent violation second law 
correct statement second law entropy decrease impossible principle improbable achieved manipulating fx chosen define macrostate 
attempt write stronger law put mercy produce violation 
recognizing increase decrease confidence second law means experimenter sees apparent violation issuing announcement prudent search unobserved degree freedom 
connection entropy information works ways seeing apparent decrease entropy signifies ignorance relevant 

pauli analysis consider phenomenological theory 
clausius definition entropy determines difference entropy thermodynamic states closed system particles enter leave connected reversible path gamma dq surprised claim necessarily extensive reaction surely bricks twice heat capacity brick clausius entropy possibly extensive 
see note entropy difference proportional number molecules heat capacity proportional pressure depends necessarily true true far making entropy extensive

equation state pv heat capacity nk boltzmann constant 
elementary textbooks find thermodynamic relations gamma dv dt nk log nk log evident satisfied entropy function form log log kf arbitrary constant arbitrary function 
point reversible path varied consequently definition determines dependence varied reversible path correct extra entropy convection term dn needed 
pauli noticed incompleteness saw wish entropy extensive logically additional condition impose separately 
extra condition entropy satisfy scaling law qv qn qs substituting find satisfy functional equation qn qf gamma qn log differentiating respect setting yields differential equation nf gamman general solution nf gamma log alternatively just set see general solution
