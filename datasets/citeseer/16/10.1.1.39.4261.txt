iolus framework earlier discussion seen large dynamic groups scale terms multicast security 
membership changes group members affected 
creates inherent scalability problem 
iolus framework seeks directly address problem completely doing away idea single flat secure multicast group 
iolus substitutes notion secure distribution tree 
secure distribution tree composed number smaller secure multicast subgroups arranged hierarchy create single virtual secure multicast group see 
scalability achieved having subgroup relatively independent 
specifically subgroup secure distribution tree multicast group address created suitable multicast routing protocol dvmrp cbt pim

mentioned straightforward scheme handling problem send copy member encrypted member note imply unicast 
sending separate unicast messages member group gsa simply multicasts message containing copies assuming remaining members encrypted different member see

may having decrypt re encrypt data require enormous amount encryption bandwidth old trick indirection sharply reduce cost re encryption 
having sender directly encrypt data sender generates random key transmission basis uses key encrypt data

example derive keys digital signatures 
key data encrypted way decrypting re encrypting packet reduced simply decrypting re encrypting random key 
technique efficient suffice applications may result transient security breaches type described section

iolus key management service far described iolus complete security framework multicasting applications directly send receive data 
separate problems key management securing transmitting data 
iolus operations linked secure multicast group exists virtual sense 
actuality member access local multicast subgroup gsas involved key management data transmission create single secure multicast group image 
security aware applications know best secure send data 
simply need access common achieve security objectives

difference directly secure multicast group transmit real data secure multicast group transport second set keying material

easily accomplished changing minute 
iolus group key management service number benefits ffl decouples key management distribution data transmission 
allows best existing multicast communications protocols limits 
allows iolus non multicast applications require group keying 
ffl decouples key management distribution key usage 
decoupling useful example group members want encryption algorithm wish share gsas 
ffl suggested multicast conferences implemented modular manner collection specialized applications connected conference bus :10.1.1.51.6717
paradigm iolus effectively provide common key management service applications obviating need individually implement key management 
deployment issues far glossed deployment issues related iolus framework 
example assumed secure distribution tree component gsas considered built managed 
course issues scope framework really discussed context actual protocol implementation network protocol 
gain understanding issues briefly consider section caution reader issues require research 
secure distribution tree management management secure distribution tree encompasses issues controls tree component gsas tree fixed dynamic network built single secure multicast destroyed reused multicasts 
possibility gsas owned operated principal charge multicast group tree setup dynamically solely particular secure multicast group 
secure principal charge multicast retains control entire tree gsas shared different multicasts 
spectrum possible imagine situation gsas basically fixed network owned trusted third parties network service providers 
principal wishes initiate secure multicast tree provider 
obviously secure scheme practical 
possibilities exist 
may principals media companies hold secure multicasts may manage gsas people simply avail services offered third parties 
secure distribution tree construction related issue construction secure distribution tree placement gsas network 
important issue practice scalability offered secure distribution tree iolus heavily dependent members distributed various subgroups 
unfortunately impossible find optimal placement gsas network doing requires knowledge joins leaves 
practice natural placements gsas generally lead scalability 
results fact networks inherently hierarchical 
consider internet 
top hierarchy major nationwide backbones 
lead regional networks turn lead isp networks directly corporate campus networks 
networks may divided subnets 
quite natural place gsas entrance networks especially lower levels 
example placed firewall machines entrance campus networks building networks 
suggests gsas sender receiver 
option definitely ensure scalability dynamic 
specific gsa overloaded gsa started level parent subgroup 
membership overloaded gsa split reallocated new gsa 
secure distribution tree discovery accessing secure multicast iolus prospective member locate designated gsa locate secure distribution tree 
interesting issue gsa location requires mapping global name name secure multicast group local name gsa handling local subgroup secure multicast group 
gsas fixed locating gsa easy set known gsas 
gsas dynamic solution take dynamic nature account 
suggest possible solutions gsas notify known local directory service start handling secure multicast group directory service knows direct queries multicasting anycasting locate gsa 
note gsa location equivalent mapping global secure multicast group local multicast subgroup address gsa address local multicast subgroup pass newly joined member authorization 
admission control noted iolus framework tied particular layer protocol stack may implemented layer offers basic best effort unicast multicast communications 
noted job network security protocol secure communications insecure network attackers assumed free rein 
particular keeping attackers network scope network security protocol requires external network admission control 
argued current multicast communications protocols job attacker easy 
attacker simply declare receiver receive multicast communications 
easier attacker access communication facilitates certain types denial service attacks 
instance multicast routing implements rendezvous routing cbt pim attacker mass subscription group displace rendezvous point potentially cause communications degraded 
counter threats suggested secure multicast protocol combined multicast routing protocol routers perform admission control form igmp 
scheme drawback routers inherently part insecure network iolus framework combined multicast routing protocols noted necessary order counter threats 
protocol designers worried threats include hooks routers provide advisory admission control 
routers contact designated gsa seek permission prior extending group 
way routers trusted provide requisite control rogue routers trusted case continue please 
implementation experience performance results ultimately merits iolus framework understood wide scale deployment 
wished better understanding key issues concerning framework

application interfacing difficult applications iolus protocol secure multicasting key management 

performance performance penalty incurred gsas forwarding data multicast subgroups answer questions implemented simple software package uses iolus protocol 
package consists gsc gsi applications iolus client application interact gsas

related approaches section review sparse literature pertaining multicast security protocols 
protocols primarily multicast key distribution protocols 
distribute unchanging members join take care change key group membership changes 
furthermore protocols centralized approach basically works follows 
secure multicast group assigned group controller gc 
gc processes join requests hands joining member protocols implementing type approach 
describe group key management protocol gkmp 
gkmp similar gkmp gc implemented basis designated member current group implements gc 
type approach addresses key management issues scalability issues mentioned 
centralized gc adds scalability problem 
ballardie scalable multicast key distribution scheme part cbt multicasting architecture 
proposal multicast group group key distribution center similar gc controls access group 
suggested initially cbt core assumes role 
nodes join cbt distribution tree functionality passed nodes 
effect joining router provided group access package contains acl node decides join multicast contacts nearest router acting authenticates joining member passes group key 
job distributing exploiting implicit hierarchy multicast distribution tree unable change face membership changes 
note gc really need involved leaves group keying material change leaves 
gkmp note changing keying material may necessary group membership changes offer solution establishing new group 
course establishing new group clearly scalable requires re authentication part group members 
concluding remarks primary motivation design enhanced scalability 
closing interesting note iolus framework provides certain auxiliary benefits technical non technical nature ffl enhanced security 
lack global adds security iolus 
compromise equally bad attacker access group allow attacker arbitrarily share principals 
principals may assigned different gsas making compromised useless 
effect helps contain attacks situations 
ffl flexible management 
large multicast may easily case single entity gsc know principal allowed access secure multicast group 
iolus allows natural delegation responsibility 
example consider university offering distance learning course multicast internet 
companies may wish employees take course 
companies apply university gsc admission secure multicast group top level subgroup 
employees apply gsi admission group subgroup 
gsc need know exactly allowed delegates responsibility gsi trusts 
ffl flexible pricing 
primary reason securing multicast communications economic value data multicast 
flexible pricing similar related flexible management 
consider university offering distance learning courses internet 
university wishes charge tuition charging principal individually charges companies top level subgroup 
having bought multicast companies free decide view pay 
summary multicast security inherently different unicast security 
providing key management pair principals multicast security protocol provide key management changing group principals 
creates scalability problem keying material needs changed entire group group membership changes 
address scalability problems secure multicast proposed iolus scalable general purpose framework secure multicasting multicast key management 
iolus discards idea large flat secure multicast group replaces notion secure distribution tree composed multiple smaller secure multicast subgroups arranged hierarchy 
subgroups form single virtual secure multicast group 
glue holds subgroups consists group security agents manage subgroup 
gsas conspire invisibly deliver multicast data securely subgroups creating single secure multicast group image senders receivers 
furthermore better understand iolus implemented package applications protocol iolus framework 
package provide secure multicasting service independent key management service 
preliminary experience suggests iolus protocols readily applications performance penalty imposed secure distribution tree significant applications
