focusing discovering documents pertain topic interest user approach introduced criterion directionality agent favor neutral opposed event 
method described coercing sentence meanings metaphoric model semantic interpretation needed order determine directionality sentence done respect model 
interpretation method designed integrated component hybrid information access system 
light increasing availability computer accessible full text important goal text intelligent system provide means answering questions documents contents 
standard information retrieval systems sophisticated methods grouping documents similarities terms terms user queries see salton croft turtle volume overviews 
data systems titles abstracts opposed full text documents 
data document topic known documents terms similar considered topic 
document similarity useful criteria accessing information availability full text opens exploration 
way structuring corpus sort documents categories topical content 
current text systems accomplish task varying degrees sophistication 
example rubric mccune allows user define elaborate conceptual hierarchy keywords classifies documents topics contain 
hayes volume describes related systems 
assuming main topic document determined document distinguished describing topic 
way distinguish document neighbors answer specific questions contents 
number systems developed look answers set predefined questions specific topic domain notably demonstrated message understanding conferences lehnert sundheim 
systems require large amounts task specific domain knowledge complex inferencing capabilities 
process building representing necessary knowledge bases time consuming coverage di cult achieve 
reason question revised document distin describing topic costs associated domain dependent approaches 
needed classification criterion applies wide range text useful question relatively independent domain 
criterion text semantic attribute lie continuum extremes 
example corpus newspaper articles topic environmental issues pertaining wildlife inquire public figures stated opposed neutral favor proposed cleanup plan 
generally articles classified answer query agent favor event 
examples queries genre situation improving worsening agent dominating dominated agent 
call criterion directionality contrast topicality criterion mentioned 
directional queries domain independent domain wildlife mideast peace agreements urban policy question applicable 
mechanism classify article directionality criterion provides precise interpretation narrow slice semantic content document 
goal avoid expense full semantic analysis restricting type information extracted text 
sentence directionality determined 
clearly keyword analysis su cient 
consider classification criterion agent favor event applied pair sentences introduced legislation lift ban dumping 
introduced legislation support ban dumping 
di erence word manages reverse attitude agents situation lift support antonyms context 
correctly distinguish sentences partial understanding come play 
semantics need comprehensive interpretation mechanism take advantage restricted nature query order minimize degree inference needed 
propose sentence interpretation model called direction text interpretation dti 
direction text interpretation isolated portions text interpreted framework general domain independent metaphoric model

conceptual model applied cognitive linguistics section explains conceptual model underlies direction text interpretation 
path model call extension talmy force dynamic model influence reddy description conduit metaphor 
force dynamic model studies cognitive linguistics shown cases multitude linguistic phenomena described terms general conceptual framework 
reddy reddy describes conduit metaphor seen underlying english expressions communication 
framework thought schematized object placed speaker container sent conduit 
receiver listener removes objectified thought container possesses 
inferences conduits blocked full applied notions communication 
example english speakers statements meaning come put thought words sending kind message 
may case speakers unconsciously structure talk communication framework metaphor 
example claim underlying conceptual framework revealed expression language talmy theory force dynamics talmy 
theory describes interaction agents respect force lexically grammatically expressed focusing english 
notions scope force dynamics include force agent resistance force overcoming resistance 
talmy claims force dynamics conceptual organizing system fundamental categories structures organizes meaning akin familiar linguistic categories number aspect 
force dynamic model posits participation opposing entities named agonist antagonist 
entity expresses intrinsic force tending motion rest 
relative strengths tendencies agents important stronger entity able manifest tendency expense 
balance relative strengths determines interaction resulting state 
clarify ideas consider sentences taken talmy ball kept rolling wind blowing 
shed kept standing despite gale wind blowing 
ball kept rolling despite sti grass 
log kept lying incline ridge 
sentence ball seen agonist wind antagonist 
agonist tendency rest forced tendency stronger force wind 
sentence agonist shed tendency rest case able maintain tendency opposing force antagonist wind 
agonist ball tending motion 
case antagonist force succeed reversing agonist tendency sentence antagonist ridge overcomes agonist tendency motion 
examples illustrate simplest form interactions 
talmy describes complex examples force interaction changes dynamically situations antagonist stronger entities remains way agonist allowing description concept letting plug staying loose water drain tank 
talmy speculates traditional understanding scope causation narrow expanded include notions letting evidence indicates letting causing expressed conceptual framework 
talmy shows certain force dynamic concepts grammatical representation 
example agonist appears subject role stronger antagonist expressed conjoining clause headed 
similarly interaction weaker antagonist expressed clause headed prepositional phrase headed despite 
preposition indicates force dynamical opposition particles ball rolling 
talmy argues form keep ball kept rolling considered auxiliary way act modal 
force dynamical system truly underlies language user conceptual system useful device interpreting expressions causal interaction 
example theory helpful problem determining sentence describing entities engaged interaction relatively stronger 
path model agent favors entity event agent said desire existence entity 
furthermore agent favors impedance existence entity said opposed entity 
useful heuristic inferred agent favors entity triumph force dynamic interaction agent favors entity 
particular sentential description may string occurrences ect state entity 
force dynamic model expressive power represent augmented 
focusing relative strength interacting entities model represent happens single entity course encounters entities 
entity schematized moving path destination goal 
entity may encounter barriers path indicating tendency blocked 
agents independent entity power introduce barriers remove barriers reinforce weaken barriers initiate entity journey speed slow journey bring entity destination 
agent attitude entity determined chooses ect movement entity metaphorical path 
empirical analysis directional sentences reveals inferences generated path metaphor su ce answer directional query agent favor event

feature optional 
secondary agent 
attribute indicates secondary agent plays role indication sentence directionality 
example governor persuaded farmers implement irrigation measures may desirable retain information doing implementation unstated 
feature optional 
lexical items path action assumed depends action target entity 
example verb shield acts remove block path action president shielded elephants attacks constituent feature points constituent containing block action 
sentence simply president shielded elephants verb act enable action target entity point constituent neutral action 
lexical items take remove block action take di erent action block type target entity follows 
open class lexical items fall small set categories example remove block verb block noun initial set defined classification new words relatively simple 
closed class items prepositions require special attention 
important syntactic consideration arises determining agent attitude involves clausal attachment
