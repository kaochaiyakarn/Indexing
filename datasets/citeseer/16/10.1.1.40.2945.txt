preliminary stages 
plans improving web learner 
reimplement interface html may web browser type computer 
give control information displayed 
example reorder links promising unseen ones displayed displayed different color 
plan distinguishing links coldlist user warned visit 
web pages may changed anytime plan doing necessary bookkeeping notifying user item coldlist changed looks items hotlist 
order evaluate unseen pages necessary retrieve entire html convert page feature vector 
considering extension just searches characters entire document 
may reduce transmission overhead agent interactively 
plan investigating improvements underlying information extraction machine learning capabilities 
example features different forms root word probably single feature root word 
addition potential features machine learning may informative individually combination machine learning may predictive users interests 
similarly successful learner problem bayesian classifier independence assumptions probably violated data 
possible improve accuracy detecting correcting violations pazzani
