software conference assistant complex context aware application 
uses wide variety context supporting interaction single user environment multiple users 
application difficult build great deal underlying support 
built top architecture designed support context aware applications 
briefly describe architecture show architecture build conference assistant 

context architecture previous architecture toolkit designed implemented support building context aware applications 
briefly discuss components architecture merits 
architecture consists types components widgets servers interpreters 
implement concepts necessary easing development contextaware applications 
shows relationship context components applications 
information context architecture see www cc gatech edu fce context widgets encapsulate information single piece context location activity example 
provide uniform interface components applications context hiding details underlying context sensing mechanism 

relationship applications context architecture 
arrows indicate data flow 
context server similar widget supports set features widget 
difference server aggregates multiple pieces context 
fact responsible context particular entity person place object 
aggregation facilitates access context applications interested multiple pieces context single entity 
context interpreter interpret context 
example context widget may provide location context form latitude longitude application may require location form street name 
context interpreter may provide abstraction 
context components instantiated executed independently separate threads separate computing devices 
architecture distribution context architecture transparent context aware applications mediating communications applications components 
supports communications hypertext transfer protocol sending receiving messages 
language sending data extensible markup language xml 
xml chosen support lightweight integration distributed components facilitate access architecture heterogeneous platforms multiple programming languages 
requirements devices architecture support ascii parsing tcp ip 
minimal requirements particularly important mobile wearable computers communications support tends small 
context architecture promotes main concepts building context aware applications separation context sensing context aggregation abstraction 
relieves application developers having deal sense access context information concentrate context 
provides simplifying abstractions aggregation abstraction easier applications obtain context require 
aggregation provides shopping context entity allowing application designers think terms high level information low level details
