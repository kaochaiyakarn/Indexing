basar users 
users get uniform access search engines knowledge base background describes different search engines call best time call relevant results past 
basar users remember necessary information time call search engine 
users access history actions 
example basar supports relocating sites visited past links stored bookmarks example 
may kind frustrating job users find liked surfing remembering 
decrease cognitive load delegating tasks purpose basar agents provide mechanisms allow users delegate tasks agents normally done user world wide web 
delegating task agent additional effort user 
users able delegate example search filter tasks agents may night user absent additional effort worth 
delegation model user decide get computational support agents 
task delegated agents semi autonomously task completion 
characteristics basar reduce cognitive load users agents perform annoying repetitive tasks user giving user efficient time perform task shorter period time 
increase relevance link agents basar increase relevance information delivered user check permanently validity links perform sort filter operations reducing set information delivered user user specific filter sort mechanisms
