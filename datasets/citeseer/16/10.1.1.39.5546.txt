web user interface catching dream user interface researcher complexity building user interfaces lack portability done 
commercial system building specific platform goal production entire system 
ui research goal usually demonstration small technique widget rest system just noise essential noise 
surrounding system bad people see novel feature just irrelevant problems surrounding system substantial hard test 
furthermore having produced prototype system test finds world uses windows hypercard lovely demo quite useful 
joy web changed 
possible create relatively large test beds broad interface understood focus critical novel aspects 
demonstrated point demos available 
surprisingly vast proportion prototype ui research systems built web java 
advantages researcher course equally true large scale commercial 
organisations hardware software platforms uniform cross platform ubiquitous nature web means way deliver interfaces organisational intranets users internet 
examples include line banking systems uk rail information line currency conversion course growing numbers commerce sites amazon 
course built systems know lot hype somewhat 
soon attempt deploy rich web interfaces detailed layout javascript find interpretation technology far standard java 
furthermore soon uses advanced features flash animations cuts large numbers potential users haven got latest browsers plug ins 
rapid user interface construction rapidly degenerate random search find browser bug

architectures software architecture concern user interface researchers distributed nature web limited local functionality increase importance effective architectural design 
central question software architecture especially distributed platform goes 
user interface terms question answers 
going back time model main components presentation display management determines appearance low level behaviour interface dialogue control determines order interaction link underlying data structures semantics 
layered presentation semantics distinction evident architectures implementation frameworks mvc pac arch slinky 
historically distinctions largely aimed program modularisation maintenance re 
distributed systems web conceptual units allocated enormous difference performance 
web number places computation occur 
obvious user browser web client forms javascript java web server example cgi scripts 
simply matter client server design 
nature web technology puts string limits possible desirable example security limitations applets 
addition web systems database backends site computation 
overview sites interaction see interfaces articles active web technology 
probably foolish word talking web systems making computation proxy servers 
just caching visited pages proxies intermediaries variety purposes example filter transform pages display small portable devices counter transmission protocol problems 
way application split sites affects resources efficiency important affects rate feedback user 
fixed targets kinds hand eye coordination feedback come ms ability control collapses lip sound synchronisation tighter synchronisation needed 
documented limits long people prepared wait seconds bigger actions feeling frustrated 
collaborative systems additional issue may views shared data shared control locking individual interaction 
inevitably leads complex decisions 
collaborative systems consider feedback seeing effect actions feedthrough long takes see effects users actions 
extent feedthrough intractable users physically remote communication take time 
users physically close interactions mediated distant 
proxies similar entities routers offer excellent opportunity local shared computation 
large data sets 
applications split parts need rapid interaction parts require heavy back data manipulation 
placement easy interaction rich parts executed close user parts executed close data server 
interfaces exploration large data sets depend rapid user interaction representations apparently entire data set 
examples include various systems maryland starfield displays xerox including hyperbolic trees 

hyperbolic tree inxight software systems implemented high workstations complete data set stored locally 
web large data sets possible normal split interaction data required 
obviously data downloaded enable local interaction mean subset data systems gain power allowing user see representation data set 
means abstraction data index aggregate sufficiently detailed allow interaction 
note need entirely accurate abstraction simply clusters original data averages attributes 
user drills see detail new aggregates downloaded 
goal produce representations user examine data accuracy 
obvious lesson took graphics community years learn

short difference traditional interface design web design totally control 
design pages documents caricature slightly main types professionally designed web page content rich pages vs image rich cdrom style pages typical home user quick dead 
common sites service providers search engines corporate sites 
proponent low bandwidth web pages jacob nielsen known opposition frames 
looking media suggests graphics images significantly increases accessibility information 
criteria adopting style users appeal equipment network connectivity possess visually impaired visitors site 
apparent page formats chosen criteria 
reasons web designers caricature computing graduates limited graphic design skills lots buttons moving graphics graphic designers little understanding interaction pages hunt click 
problem perfectly designed computer screen gives message interests appeals aesthetic sense matter looks designer screen necessarily web page 
web different medium sharing features computer interfaces print media broadcast media distinct 
understanding medium creation webs depends understanding medium affordances 
time 
pages take time download delays plug ins initialise browser lays tables main reason cited adopting graphics free low graphics pages 
simplify issue example reuse graphics site mean page takes load subsequent pages faster graphics cached 
full text sites panacea 
designed small pages menu options move deeper site 
network delay web page loading dominated initial handshake server small page may take nearly long download larger information 
hand nature table layout algorithms may mean text rich large tables may take long time format 
space 
seen pages scale badly deep frame structures mean text trying read cm square box bottom right hand corner screen content formatted fixed size sits top centre large empty screen page small screen needs endlessly scrolled side side page laid large screen lines long hard line eye moves back 
layout easy task best times web don know size screen formatting fonts available line spacing precisely images placed 
simply problem web graphical toolkits motif java awt complex layout rules allow dynamic window resizing endless pretty printers automatic text layout 
probably fair say existing solutions perfect 
problems helped fact web authoring tools produce fixed size pages extensive editing required appropriate multiple platforms screens 
authoring tools tackle technological issues multiple browsers tables frames different styles javascript issue size completely ignored 
appropriate understanding medium help 
graphically possible produce strong vertical horizontal features techniques suitable fixed layout graphics breaking lead misalignments browsers 
sites relatively narrow fixed width layout stretch downwards perfect effective compromise 
colour graphics 
surprising designers understand limitations electronic media colour reproduction poor colour matching dithering helped fact applications interact correctly operating system palette management 
colour web safe palette totally safe especially background images fact colour problems backgrounds intractable largely 
said simple ways avoid worst pitfalls 
standard colour guidelines interface hold 
remember colour blindness especially common red green 
fact rely colour distinguish things usually trouble 
colour part vision nearly precise fast acting black white precise contrast part sure difference contrast just colour text line art background 
colours particular bright red blue bad picking detail 
course red redundant cue non colour blind ultimate attention grabber 
reasons browsers print background graphics really want ink page white text black background may look screen time interacts colour compression technology 
little understanding enormous difference 
graphics programs save optimised colour palettes small web safe palette image created may difference dithered usually large image sharper smaller image 
common see pages graphics split small pieces 
reasons example may possible create mixed text graphics layouts text appears quickly screen small images different palettes graphics formats 
designers realise encoding gif images means large areas flat colour compress 
single large image smaller total size overhead small images
