load source selecting person informants considered person workload 
load results regular day day activities added burden serving requests expertise 
immediate workload workload time important criteria selecting person pursue help 
selection regular workload rarely case organization allows person sit idle waiting asked questions 
organizations hope get employee 
looking information information seeker find experts 
msc criteria selecting workload expert handle performance day day duties 
junior level developer stated rationale careful preparation selection way 
people ask 
aren just sitting waiting ask questions 
han technical support institutionalized mechanism estimate workload 
house help management application maintains call list call list tracks support requests clients assigned specific support representative 
support representative view call list simply entering mnemonics desired representative 
length individual call list important shared information 
junior support representative frequently relies expertise senior colleagues put way look list go busy today calls 
support representative uses shared information indicates general workload support representatives decide approached 
lower workload approach help 
developers similar system compare day day workload individual developers 
development group system pairs individual developers specific orders system easily compare workload different developers 
amount load developer largely gained word mouth closed office doors workers assessment workload 
selection workload time day day workload consideration 
people select expert workload imposed time 
person wanting help try disperse questions possible experts attempt distribute effort seen pest annoyance worse

ian communication language skills part difficulty support manager expert 
kumar understanding nature client business 
case ian expertise kumar easily 
providing suitable explanation experts just better providing explanations problem solution 
way expert provides explanation performance criterion people selecting expert 
certain people um time explain things just takes shot explained understand 
um know people really busy hard get hold 
times go um go time trouble understanding way explain things 
prefers pick people provide clear understandable explanations 
preferred source overloaded goes people share explain effectively 
attitude problem comprehension solution explanation performance criteria people selecting expert 
people look help mention attitude expert 
informal discussions people clearly reluctant go expert bad attitude people know know lot stuff won give information just re type person terry bad attitude accompanied example problem person seeking help expert treated joke 
fact person easily understand problem poor diagnosis explain solution labeled having bad attitude completely rule possible source 
expertise desirable cases essential 
cases people need expertise pursue person needed expertise 
selection design identification selection strategies automated 
fact selection strategies considering expert attitude difficult automate 
strategies observing workload organizational structure guide selection look promising candidates possible designs estimated computationally obtaining data 
workload difficult measure directly social norms closing door provide powerful cues information seekers 
selection assistance minimally consider alternative implicit representations workload mechanism individual mark busy 
note utility augmentative systems help users identify narrow completely select potential candidates expertise 
escalation times person selection approach expert help get help 
identification selection mechanisms failed way 
escalation way people repair failures identification selection 
simple example escalation occurred mike support representative helped client payment aging handle late deferred payments 
msc software supports aging methods nearly msc clients 
client called mike payment aging apparently ceased 
diagnostics mike determined client trying switch standard non standard aging method 
mike aging working checked change history 
saw han worked code went han help 
han minor changes code sure client having problem 
han mike went ask eyal help eyal vacation problem waiting eyal return 
eyal returned han went problem 
eyal quickly emphasized client configuration standard method closing problem 
example shows different breakdowns simple escalation eventually solved problem 
breakdown mike change history identify han candidate necessary expertise change history misleading case 
breakdown identification 
second breakdown han correctly identified eyal having expertise solve problem eyal 
selection failed han know forgotten eyal vacation unavailable 
generalization example expertise identification fail ways identification misidentification 
identification provides set candidate sources entirely large 
set includes people necessary expertise includes large number people 
may include people truly experts just talk mcdonald ackerman level expertise required 
identification result selection person proper level expertise 
identification provides set small 
identification identified candidates expertise necessary topic set excludes person necessary problem solved 
people required misidentification 
misidentification breakdown identifies set people people required expertise sufficient level solve problem answer question 
expertise identification place failure occur breakdown may occur selection phase 
example breakdown load balancing strategy may result selecting busy respond 
alternatively breakdown performance criteria may result selection candidate just understand nature problem 
escalation provides way adjust set candidates initially identified candidates utilizing information gained initial attempt 
note just identification selection occasionally analytically separable initial search true escalation 
term escalation describe increase intensity possible solution pursued 
escalation mean problem pushed organizational hierarchy 
msc people seeking information may go desirable sources people expertise ill maintained documents sources higher psychological cost objectionable people cross departmental organizational boundaries 
practice breakdowns repairs fluid 
example shows breakdowns identification selection repairs interwoven fluid 
unusual event highlights critical features escalation msc

andreas example shows escalation standard repair technique msc 
simpler cases example escalation expertise craig eyal 
substitute sysadmin included craig recommendation 
example shows participants separate identification selection necessary expertise karl reserved craig 
substitute sysadmin selected second escalation potential candidates identified 
escalation design example demonstrates breakdowns occur naturally 
expert locator systems breakdowns 
identification selection escalation behaviors may difficult support fully 
clear reservation expertise karl craig supported system 
escalations simplest cases multiple iterations 
multiple iterations require mechanisms tracking problem state social informational 
iteration expert locator system need mechanisms understand user previously attempted suggestions modified fit severity situation problem 
argues types feedback modification techniques handle escalation single problem short period time tailor preferences needs individual user 
summary field study information sharing medium sized software focused expertise leveraged social interactions participants 
observed participants solving general finding problems social mechanisms expertise identification expertise selection 
believe crucial problems solved individuals satisfy need expertise
