assumptions background section outlines assumptions regarding properties physical network layers ad hoc networks includes brief description dsr routing protocol 
definitions term neighbor refer node wireless transmission range node 
likewise neighborhood refers nodes wireless transmission range node 
physical layer characteristics assume bidirectional communication symmetry link nodes 
means node capable receiving message node time node received message node time assumption valid wireless mac layer protocols including ieee macaw require bidirectional communication reliable transmission 
watchdog mechanism relies bidirectional links 
addition assume wireless interfaces support promiscuous mode operation 
promiscuous mode means node range node overhear communications communications directly involve lucent technologies wavelan interfaces capability 
promiscuous mode appropriate ad hoc network scenarios particularly military scenarios useful scenarios improving routing protocol performance 
dynamic source routing dsr dsr demand source routing protocol 
packet route path consisting addresses nodes agreed participate routing packet 
protocol referred demand route paths discovered time source sends packet destination source path 
divide dsr main functions route discovery example route request 
node sends route request packet nd path node 
route request forwarded network node adding address packet 
sends back route reply path contained route request packet reached 
thick lines represent path route reply takes back sender 
forwards packet overhear transmission verify attempted pass packet solid line represents intended direction packet sent dashed line indicates transmission range overhear packet transfer 
route maintenance 
illustrates route discovery 
node source wishes communicate node destination know paths initiates route discovery broadcasting route request packet neighbors contains destination address neighbors turn append addresses route request packet rebroadcast 
process continues route request packet reaches send back route reply packet inform discovered route 
route request packet reaches contains path may choose reverse path send back reply bidirectional links required initiate new route discovery back routes source destination source may receive multiple route replies destination 
dsr caches routes route cache 
second main function dsr route maintenance handles link breaks 
link break occurs nodes path longer transmission range 
intermediate node detects link break forwarding packet node route path sends back message source notifying link break 
source try path route discovery path

watchdog watchdog method detects misbehaving nodes 
illustrates watchdog works 
suppose exists path node intermediate nodes node transmit way node listen node tra transmits packet forward tell transmits packet 
encryption performed separately link expensive tell tampered payload header 
node hear forward packet transmission collides packet source node believes forwarded packet received packet due collision packet 
implement watchdog maintaining bu er sent packets comparing overheard packet packet bu er see match 
packet bu er removed forgotten watchdog forwarded 
packet remained bu er longer certain timeout watchdog increments failure tally node responsible forwarding packet 
tally exceeds certain threshold bandwidth determines node misbehaving sends message source notifying misbehaving node 
watchdog technique advantages weaknesses 
dsr watchdog advantage detect misbehavior forwarding level just link level 
watchdog weaknesses detect misbehaving node presence ambiguous collisions receiver collisions limited transmission power false misbehavior collusion partial dropping 
ambiguous collision problem prevents overhearing transmissions illustrates packet collision occur listening forward packet

receiver collision problem node tell sends packet tell receives 
collision occurs rst forwards packet sees forwarding packet assumes successfully receives 
skip retransmitting packet leave 
purposefully cause transmitted packet collide waiting transmitting forwarding packet 
rst case node sel sh want waste power retransmissions
