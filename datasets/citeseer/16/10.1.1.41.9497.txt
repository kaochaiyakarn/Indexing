psychological general principle estimating parameters maximizing expected utility familiar accepted decades

put know phenomena consist sine waves 
early century respected economist wesley mitchell opposed fourier analysis grounds periodicities data real reproduced easily merely correlations data 
today economists sophisticated understand periodicity correlations data different ways saying thing
