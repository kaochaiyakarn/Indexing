methods algorithm determining noun phrase binding term depends umls metathesaurus specialist lexicon ncbi genbank arbiter specific processing takes advantage information local molecular biology domain 
highly ambiguous character important words identifying binding terms indicates importance applying arbiter text molecular biology domain 
currently assured processing medline abstracts appropriate mesh indexing terms 
order generalize processing text indexed exploring automatic methods determining biomedical domain free text example 
previous research directed recognizing terminology free text applied terms occurring text just meeting specified criteria 
processing shallow extensive linguistic analysis normally provide interpretation 
strategy shares significant features concentrates protein names appeal existing knowledge source 
submitting input text natural language processing techniques arbiter takes advantage program aronson operates text strings order expand author defined acronyms 
enhanced text locally defined acronyms expanded submitted arbiter processing

mutants bind wild type toxin levels 
mutants umls metathesaurus cell wild type toxin levels arbiter uses information basis series steps determine status noun phrases binding terms possible identify referent terms

amino acid peptide protein nucleic acid nucleotide gene genome nucleotide sequence factor lipid organic chemical cell cell component virus example noun phrases identified binding terms match metathesaurus concepts semantic type amino acid peptide protein 
play important distinct roles promoting binding 
noun phrases match proteins genes listed ncbi genbank identified binding terms 
arbiter access matching program provides exact matches partial matches confidence score 
example noun phrase matches exactly genbank entry de 
noun phrase constitutes binding term referent identified genbank entry

noun phrases metathesaurus metamap constitute exact match entry genbank program referent 
arbi ter attempts identify binding terms referent 
terms provide valuable information human review regarding nature text appear 
step program takes identifying noun phrase binding term referent determine head noun phrase occurs constrained set words generally designating entities 
examples words serving heads noun phrases include concerned various biomolecular phenomena box chain sequence subunit repeat ligand motif mutant terminus strand molecular cellular topography spike cleft groove pit pocket surface membrane general terms referring various characteristics entities element receptor site complex component domain target 
sentence test set illustrating binding words serving heads noun phrases binding terms 
structure domain shows beta sandwich motif narrow hydrophobic cleft binds exposed surface 
measure identify binding terms consider words constituting noun phrase exhibit normal morphological characteristics english words contain vowel digits 
text tokens exhibit characteristics tagged potential binding terms acronyms defined locally 
example returned binding term arbiter basis evidence 
words components phrase delta exhibit normal english characteristics indicate binding term previous criterion 
phrase occur metathesaurus genbank contain general binding word missed binding argument 
lines evidence strongly suggest delta binds dna dimer 
instances arbiter takes advantage contextual information local current 
determined exception term occurs immediately left text token binding qualifies binding term

reflecting cooperativity delta binding dna 
arbiter processes sentences containing form verb bind scans entire looking terms locally defined virtue appear ing immediately left binding 
terms considered binding terms 
final step arbiter joins contiguous simple binding terms meeting certain specified conditions single complex binding term 
example individual binding terms recognized coiled coil domain terminus gene product combined complete binding term highlighted 
previously unrecognized coiled coil domain terminus gene product demonstrate 
conditions indicate term incorporated larger structure include prepositional modification terminus gene product complementation 
evaluation submitted medline abstracts test collection various steps arbiter processing discussed preceding section order discover closely program matched determinations hand regarding binding term identification 
results simple noun phrases binding sentences test collection marked hand binding terms 
arbiter identified binding terms recall partial measure effectiveness 
binding terms retrieved correct precision 
somewhat thirds unique noun phrases correctly identified binding terms assigned referent umls metathesaurus ncbi genbank

important group correctly identified binding terms assigned specific referent general binding term heads response elements amino terminal sh domain 
smaller number binding terms identified failing conform normal english morphology example virtue occurring locally defined binding term nova 
discussion false negative errors produced arbi ter processing test set occurred relevant concept appear knowledge sources appeal noun phrase subject term specific processing 
example binding term occur metathesaurus genbank set general binding terms available arbiter 
term morphological characteristics normal english word binding term acronym defined local context 
group false negative errors ultimately due part speech ambiguity 
example sequence listed specialist lexicon verb noun part speech 
acquires stem loop structure includes sequence binds tat 
noted earlier employ stochastic tagger resolve type ambiguity resolution completely accurate 
instance part speech sequence incorrectly determined verb 
consequently parser assigned syntactic structure incorrectly error sequence analyzed noun phrase followed verb sequence 
sequence perceived unit qualifying binding term 
majority errors produced false negative false positive due single characteristic arbiter traced variety syntactic phenomena arbiter identifies single binding term phrase fact contains smaller distinct binding terms 
example arbiter identified entire sequence bold single binding term 
identify receptor produced fusion protein alkaline specific binding 
syntactic phenomenon underlies error fact sentence preposition functions particle verb produce noun phrase modifier 
object separate argument produce part noun phrase head 
binding terms identified fusion protein alkaline 
single decision noted resulted errors false negatives smaller components false positive longer phrase 
currently strictly count identifications errors partial credit unwarranted situations 
coordinate structures pervasively contribute particular arbiter error type example illustrates 
larc cc mcp mip alpha mip beta competed larc binding gpr cy 
program identified entire phrase bold single binding term 
opening parenthesis mcp contributed error coordination primary factor 
arbiter able determine components phrase separate noun phrases coordinated components single term 
deficiency generated false negatives cc mcp mip alpha mip beta false positive phrase 
currently pursuing aggressive approach coordinate structures address errors type 
basis promising results pilot project applying arbiter modest sized collection abstracts relevant molecular binding affinities believe deficiencies addressed potential benefits pursuing approach 
note potential generalize creation valuable factual databases medline 
binding relationships chosen immediate significance relative ease parsing databases relationships example feasible modest modifications general methodology arbiter
