decision table consists hierarchical table entry higher level table gets broken values pair additional attributes form table 
structure similar dimensional stacking 
visualization method allows model attributes understood unfamiliar machine learning 
various forms interaction visualization useful static designs 
keywords classifier decision table dimensional stacking trellis displays relational data data mining 

supervised classification learning induction algorithm produces model labeled set training data 
resulting classification model capable predicting labels new set unlabeled records attributes training data 
distinct label value called class 
word attribute refer column relational dataset 
classifier models applied black box 
necessary understand model order effectively prediction 
realization great insight gained visualizing structure data mining model 
decision trees earliest classification models represented graphically easy understand structure 
simple bayesian classifiers represented graphically 
neural networks arcane structure difficult visualize 
fortunately decision tables simple structure suitable creating understandable display 
ability describe structure classifier way people easily understand transforms classifiers incomprehensible black boxes tools knowledge discovery 
classification explanation reduces trust user system 
spiegelhalter physicians reject system gave insufficient explanation model accuracy 
human may decide classifier realizes irrelevant attributes bad data important factors ignored 
initial attempts display decision tables form general logic diagram 
format cell decision table single color indicate predicted class 
methods visualizing multi dimensional datasets variables form hierarchy proposed 
leblanc ward proposed dimensional stacking shows single colored cell lowest level hierarchy 
trellis displays expanded concept generalizing representation cell lowest level plot type scatterplot surface plot line graph 
deficiency methods static scene limited levels detail display gets large cells small useful 
interactive drill drill drill filtering animation allow user explore great detail specific regions interest comparing regions may higher hierarchy 

design requirements solutions decision tables tend large number cells lowest level 
example attributes values attribute potentially cells 
fortunately fact data seldom uniformly distributed space reduces cell count considerably practice 
size usually far great deal interactively 
building scene take prohibitively long 
solution provide levels detail users incrementally drill 
graphics computed lower levels drill request occurs 
general design attempts follow ben shneiderman visual information seeking mantra overview zoom filter details demand 
data structure inherently hierarchical easy start overview showing just top levels hierarchy 
dimensional manipulation allows flexible navigation studying regions interest 
drilling locally gets user details demand drill return actual raw data classifier induced 
filtering specific values ranges values implemented 
cells needs show distribution classes records matching cell 
distribution shown cake chart similar pie chart rectangular shape rectangular slices wedge shaped slices 

treatment attribute values attributes set discrete values classifier effective 
attribute continuous inducer uses entropy discretization distribution classes adjacent bins different possible 
discretization done globally 
ordering bins continuous attributes explicit categorical attributes values ordered meaningful ways alphabetically numerically record weights numerically correlation classes predicted 
cases method provides benefit 
particular class selected sorting label probability selected class determining ordering 
type ordering useful trellis displays referred main effects ordering visualizing structure simple bayesian classifier 
looking dramatically distributions change axis possible see categorical attribute correlates label interacts attribute mapped level hierarchy

note values edible mushrooms appear lower left ordering nominals specified correlation 
common relational data contain null unknown values 
null values treated quite differently value 
attribute null values unknown values denoted question mark 
visualization 
null value appears value get sorted rest 
viewing nulls toggled interfere observing trends non null data 
nominal values contain certain percentage data may filtered order simplify visualization 
useful datasets nominal attributes unique values 
visualization perform axis values pair level 
usually interested values prevalent 
slider provided filter values small percentage total weight 

implementation issues training set labeled records induction algorithm creates classifier 
automatic selection attributes core induction algorithm 
alternatively user may apply knowledge domain specify attributes level hierarchy 
tool way may build model maximal accuracy may useful gaining understanding data 
model built usually server structure passed visualization tool display 
result visualization application loads dataset memory 
drill techniques may retrieve subset original data 
structure decision table model stored simply relational table row represents aggregate records combination values attributes 
loaded memory hierarchy tables constructed new table level higher hierarchy fewer attributes 
top level single row represents data 
column attribute column record count generally sum record weights column containing vector probabilities probability gives proportion records class 
example dataset attributes plus label values classes table shows base table table shows higher table table row shows table top row combination attribute values representative records

complicated issues dealing layout implementation 
main ones aspect ratios overlapping text reducing amount geometry draw 
aspect ration ratio length width 
aspect ratio optimal easy huge extremes axis values axis moderately values levels row
