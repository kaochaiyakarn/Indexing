web surfing dangerous sport 
downloaded software may contain viruses 
materials appear come source may fact provided source 
eavesdroppers may overhear credit card numbers sensitive information 
personal information may collected legitimately violate privacy 
way approach problems attempt eliminate dangers 
example java applet interpreter tries provide execution environment programs perform harmless actions 
pcc system proof carrying code requires mobile programs prove potential hosts harmless nl 
wealth cryptographic protocols attempt eliminate dangers enforcing secrecy authenticity 
complementary approach focuses trust 
trust undertake potentially dangerous operation knowing potentially dangerous 
user prefer proof weaker forms evidence may sufficient 
recommendation close friend may convince trust piece software virus free 
may trust insecure channel transmission credit card number credit card assumes liability fraudulent uses number 
credentials policies raw materials making trust decisions 
credential statement speaker 
policy determines conditions particular action allowed 
bfl term trust management refer problem deciding requested actions supported credentials conform policies :10.1.1.44.6276
just database manager coordinates input storage data processes queries trust manager coordinates collection storage policies credentials processes requests trust decisions 
refer processing request evaluating compliance policy 
current web applications prototypical credential pics label rm states properties internet resource executable code virus checked 
important idea bfl programmable credentials :10.1.1.44.6276
simply making unconditional statements programmable credentials examine statements credentials fetch information network deciding statements 
example credential may examine existing statements ask authors statements reliable decide statements trustworthy 
simplest form policy sets rules credentials order permit action 
course deciding requested action conforms policy necessary perform potentially dangerous operations 
particular may useful fetch credentials network 
example wants know particular reviewer opinion video clip deciding watch necessary consult server distributes reviewer opinions 
danger information leak unintentionally fetching process 
danger spoofed credentials may retrieved 
third danger credentials programs running credentials retrieved network exposes full gamut risks running unknown programs 
interested managing trust eliminating danger permit dangerous actions put policy control 
policies state fetch credentials 
policies determine statements credential safe run 
example credentials written safe programming languages may permitted execute credentials written languages may executed trusted party 
policies determine credentials authenticated statements create deemed trustworthy 
example kinds statements may credentials signed particular cryptographic key 
trust management system called referee 
name acronym rule controlled environment evaluation rules 
environment evaluating compliance policies rules evaluation process may involve dangerous actions policy control 
refers credentials evaluation execution needs policy control 
placing policy control referee differs policymaker trust management system described bfl :10.1.1.44.6276

programs 
statement lists 
tri values tri value true false unknown 
statement list collection assertions expressed particular format described 
program takes initial statement list input may take additional arguments 
program may invoke program course execution 
intuitively policy governing particular action program returns true false depending available statements sufficient infer compliance non compliance policy returns unknown inference 
intuitively credential program examines statements passed derives additional statements 
generalizes usual notion credential directly supplying statements new statements supplied credential may conditional initial statements environmental factors amount space available local hard disk 
referee allows policies credentials return tri values statement lists 
useful policies return justification expressed list statements tri value answer 
example policy may reject downloading code provide statements indicating code known malicious local machine currently heavily loaded permit downloads 
useful credential programs indicate execution successful tri value addition returning list statements 
referee program returns tri value list statements 
continue observe distinction policies credentials purposes exposition 
applications running web server proxy server personal computer may invoke referee 
application program invokes referee provides database available programs provides initial statement list may empty designates particular program policy run optionally provides additional arguments designated program 
logic tri values notions true false familiar boolean logic 
asking authorization particular action example purchase order approved typically possible outcomes 
action may taken sufficient credentials exist action approved 

action may taken sufficient credentials exist deny action 

trust management system unable find sufficient credentials approve deny requested action 
third case value returned trust management system true false unknown policy force evaluation able determination requested action 
application calling trust management system decide action taken trust management system returns unknown 
alternative approach boolean values extend definition false include requests insufficient credentials trust management decision 
answer false system indicate action may taken sufficient credentials exist deny action sufficient credentials permit deny action 
notice solution intrinsically biases trust management system questions asked may force users ask questions twisted forms gain desired mode operation 
note bias considered appropriate particularly high security applications web applications fit easily traditional high security paradigms chosen avoid bias referee 
thorough discussion difficulties caused allowing trust management system return value unknown see section 
may counter productive hide fact decision reached current policy calling applications especially policy invoked subprogram policy may alternative policies dealing lack credentials 
statement lists referee statement element structure consisting content context content 
context content statement arbitrary expressions context determines content interpreted interpretation context subject agreement calling application referee 
statement lists simply unordered lists referee statements 
invocations ability policy call policy central referee reasons 
policies general defer judgment point policies bob may choose allow children view web page alice allows children view 
second evaluation particular request may require dangerous activity network access invocations allow dangerous actions executed referee policies 
dangerous activity controlled policy aspect referee central tenet policy control 
programs invoked referee program conform referee calling conventions 
required input program statement list defining current evaluation context programs may accept additional arguments required optional 
output invocation referee expression value tri value statement list 
typically program append returned statements statement lists 
note referee program invokes program control referee engine transferred program chooses exit 
invocation inherently dangerous invoking program way monitor interrupt execution invoked program 
important reason carefully acceptable invoke program doing 
installation referee environment extensible permits addition new programs long conform calling conventions 
new cryptographic hash function defined new hash checking program added reworking components policy 
programs downloaded installed dynamically execution 
callable program downloaded web trust management decision controlling referee policy allow downloaded module invoked 
referee requires program explicitly install invocable program database named programs called 
addition new callable program referee controlled currently running policy 
installations persistent multiple calls referee calling application explicitly takes action 
calling application need record new program pass part initial program database calls referee 
execution referee installations dynamic scope program default install new functionality programs calls programs called 
particular programs free override default scope installations effectively global scope

important feature referee places dangerous operations policy control making arbitrary decisions accept certain dangers avoid 
example natural avoid danger spoofed labels requiring authenticity labels verified checking digital signatures 
likelihood spoofed labels negative consequences depend context 
referee possible write policy requires signature checking certain circumstances
