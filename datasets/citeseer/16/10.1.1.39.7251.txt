briefly summarize approach follows 

pim sm members pull data packets sent dense mode groups pim sm sources get packets dense mode distribution network 
way achieving function treat dense mode multicast groups default defined individually pim sm region 
default populated pim sm border routers border routers inject pim sm sourced packets dense mode backbone similarly forward dense mode sourced packets backbone default shared tree 

pim sm members sources participate sm groups dense mode backbone defining known dense mode multicast group pim sm border routers join 
pim sm join messages sent known group processed pim sm border routers correspond specified addresses source rp

open issues concluding discuss open issues require research engineering experimental attention 
ffl aggregation information pim significant scaling issues faced pim known multicast routing schemes amount memory consumed multicast forwarding entries number active sources groups grows 
straight forward approach reducing state aggregate source addresses example highest level aggregate available address setting multicast forwarding entry 
optimal respect forwarding entry space 
optimal respect pim message size 
pim messages carry coarse information messages arrive routers closer source specific routes exist large fanout pim messages travel members aggregate inefficient cases 
closer consideration source specific state dominant concern 
pim multicast schemes dvmrp source specific state created data driven manner 
pim source specific state created source data rate exceeds threshold 
know amount state grow bound amount available bandwidth number active sources bounded 
fact number simultaneously active sources just bounded capacity links may quite large limited input capacity members group growing rate backbone link bandwidth example 
greater concern potential explosion simultaneously active multicast groups associated group specific state 
source specific trees group specific shared trees built maintained data driven manner subject bounds described 
approaches group specific state reduction consideration 
targeted central backbone regions network group specific state proliferation concern 
region maintain group specific shared tree state absence data traffic 
border routers region retain group specific state data packets arrive particular group routing state built inside region 
effect region emulates dense mode behavior 
carry border routers maintain group specific state order stay shared group tree pim join messages propagated region reach border routers side 
words state reduction reduced low duty cycle groups control messaging affected 
second approach group specific state reduction region aggregate entries entries 
approach appears quite promising particularly entries aggregated lists 
ffl interaction policy tos routing pim messages data packets may travel routes extent unicast routing long policy prohibit traffic explicitly 
obtain policy sensitive distribution multicast packets need consider paths chosen forwarding pim join register messages 
path reach rp source indicated having appropriate qos symmetric pim router forward joins upstream expect data packets allowed travel downstream 
implies bgp carry qos flags symmetry flag multicast willing flag 
generic route computed hop hop routing symmetry multicast bits set route pim message sent embedded route 
option needs added pim join messages 
absence indicate forwarding router unicast routing tables 
presence indicate forwarding route 
implies carry symmetry multicast qos bits pim carry optional route inside cause pim message multicast forwarding state occur alternative distribution tree branch 
ffl interaction receiver initiated reservation setup rsvp interesting opportunities issues arise pim style explicit join multicast routing support reservations particularly receiver oriented reservations 
example rsvp reservation messages travel receivers sources state multicast routing installs 
reservation shared multiple sources shared audio channel generally speakers time appropriate set reservation shared rp tree 
source specific reservations video channels wants avoid establishing shared tree shortly receivers going switch source specific tree 
situation routing configured send source specific reservations shared tree example 
interesting issue involves need alternate path routing reservation requests denied due insufficient resources route unicast routing considers best 
support situation pim updated allow explicit routing referred source routing pim join messages reservation may attempted alternate branch 
solution problem routing multicast packets large wide area internets 
approach uses constrained receiver initiated membership advertisement sparsely distributed multicast groups supports shared shortest path tree types protocol depend underlying unicast protocols uses soft state mechanisms reliably maintain multicast trees 
architecture accommodates graceful efficient adaptation different network conditions group dynamics
