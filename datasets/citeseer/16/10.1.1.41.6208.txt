call hyper flooding hosts may re broadcast packet 
prime emphasis hyper flooding reliable delivery minimal state retention 
salient features ffl maximum network diameter assumed known 
ffl maximum ttl time live packet known 
ffl multicast packets carry hop counts origination timestamps 
ffl hop count decremented time packet re broadcast forwarded 
ffl packets hop count zero expired timestamps forwarded 
ffl host keeps multicast group membership information 
ffl multicast packet assigned unique id computed function source address current time group id sequence number 
ffl host maintains cache ids processed multicast packets state kept packets timestamps max ttl 
ffl packet forwarded re forwarded intermediate host host acquired new neighbor time packet forwarded 
ffl host aware new neighbors packet forwarded 
easy see hyper flooding state free 
requires host keep track current neighbors 
neighbor awareness discovery wireless mobile technologies include mac network layers 
new requirement specific multicast 
keeping track neighbors certainly simpler keeping track group memberships neighbors non neighbors 
exactly hyper flooding tries avoid 
matter keeping state related actual multicast packets 
purpose prune redundant broadcasts multicast packet new neighbors acquired interim 
technique expected partially effective certain circumstances redundant broadcasts occur 
consider example happens certain host neighbor unreachable short multicast routing issues ad hoc networks obraczka tsudik page time re appears 
re broadcast old multicast packet received host question re broadcast technically new neighbor acquired 
clearly suboptimal little done prevent barring having maintain snapshot neighbors cached multicast packet id 
host receives previously seen multicast packet new neighbors acquired neighbors identified packet re broadcast 
done broadcast storms occur 
consider situation 
time packet id arrives 
time copy packet arrives 
mean time host acquired new neighbor host 
host re broadcast packet neighbors hosts acquired host new neighbor re broadcast packet 
result unnecessary broadcasts 
host inform neighbors packet re broadcast newly acquired neighbor host 
new neighbor information match remaining neighbors prevent superfluous broadcasts 
id id time time pruning unnecessary re broadcasts 
alternatively suppose host acquires new neighbors interval receiving successive copies multicast packet 
ideally mean need re broadcast packet second time 
possible host neighbors acquired new neighbors 
example illustrated 
hosts acquire new neighbors respectively 
host aware hosts new neighbors re broadcast packet 
result potential unreliability packets may reach certain hosts note hosts may get packet neighbors 
clear tradeoff robustness efficiency re broadcasting packet lead improved reliability involves transmission unnecessary duplicates consequently waste bandwidth power
