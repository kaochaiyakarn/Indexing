ontology approach knowledge management approach comprises main subtasks ontological engineering build ontology subject matter characterizing knowledge terms ontology providing intelligent access knowledge 
sense reminiscent relational database technology ontology correspond data model characterization correspond instances data contained database access take place sql 
show approach significantly different centralized databases especially respect intelligence 
approach captures distributive centralized knowledge 
knowledge directly accessed original location html pages separately input database 
approach allows discover knowledge explicitly known deduced general knowledge captured ontology 
example context human resource management senior managers lead projects paton project leader deduce paton intelligent webcrawler annotated web pages query answer joint effort distributive centralized support ontology building annotating web pages ontology subject matter page employee experts users iters users approach 
senior manager stated explicitly 
gives general overview approach 
ontology subject matter built characterize subject matter fill ontology instances 
intelligent web crawler receives query terms ontology consults subject matter instances interprets ontology generates answer 
instances actual knowledge managed distributed different html pages intranet internet ontological engineering ontology shared common understanding domain communicated people computers gru ug 
ontologies shared reused different applications ffr main reasons ontologies popular nowadays 
ontology defined formal explicit specification shared conceptualization gru bor 
conceptualization refers model phenomenon world having identified relevant concepts phenomenon 
explicit means type concepts constraints explicitly defined 
formal refers fact ontology machine readable 
shared reflects notion ontology captures consensual knowledge private individual accepted group 
ontology describes subject matter notions concepts instances relations functions axioms 
concepts ontology organized taxonomies inheritance mechanisms applied 
order come consensual ontology domain important people ontology positive attitude 
dictating particular ontology people contributed succeed 
preferably ontology constructed benjamins fensel omez erez concept component relation part number arguments type argument component type argument component part physical device ontology 
collaborative effort domain experts representatives users specialists 
joint effort requires methodology guides ontology development process tools inspect browse codify modify load ontology 
examples methodologies include fgj gp uschold gruninger methodology ug gruninger fox gf 
tool ontology server ffr interactive environment especially useful updating maintaining browser ontologies 
ontolingua ontologies translated different languages including prolog corba idl clips loom mac kif gen 
ontologies built ontolingua frame ontology gru written kif knowledge interchange format gf 
frame ontology name suggests frame language includes primitives classes sub classes attributes values relations axioms 
related ontologies connected inclusion 
example consider context automobile industry

mechanical device ontology examples classes cylinder crankshaft engine 
example binary relation part say cylinder part engine 
hydraulic device ontology include class pipe ternary relation connection express mechanical devices connected kind pipe
