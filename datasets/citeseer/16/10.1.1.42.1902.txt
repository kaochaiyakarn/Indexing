past decade witnessed significant growth developing intelligent tools financial forecasting 
expert systems quickly shown inadequate tasks required financial forecasting due static nature 
result interest started move soft computing despite fact comprehensibility paramount concern financial forecasting 
merging domains fuzzy logic rule induction paved way emergence successful generalisation techniques high 
novel technique financial forecasting derived allowing development evolving rule expert system

association rule associates attribute variables 
pq jk pq jk linguistic terms defining particular attribute defined fuzzy sets 
traditional algorithms decide association interesting user defined thresholds support confidence 
attributes support defined percentage records having attributes confidence defined percentage records having association deemed significant depends support confidence greater predefined thresholds 
contains inherent weakness difficult ascertain thresholds 
uses adjusted difference analysis identify associations attributes 
result require user defined thresholds advantage possible infer positive negative associations 
positive association means attribute having certain characteristic defined pq implies characteristic jk negative result means presence implies absence

missing market run caused fall index tracker 
may feel counter intuitive shorter window sizes performed better 
assume longer window sizes desirable possible differentiate noise true system response 
accuracy system improve training window increased 
true current state system remains constant
