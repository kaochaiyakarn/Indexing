design considerations design phase galaxy ii meetings arranged auspices darpa researchers various institutions expertise dialogue system architecture design 
meetings topics received lot attention nature control strategy appropriate decomposition server population recognizer dialogue control 
appeared main camps control strategy favored programmatic style control sequential rules favored open agent architecture involving explicit implicit message passing various servers 
eventually settled compromise scheme believe workable styles control

labelled associated roles agreed committee 
label italics box identifies corresponding mit system component 
main organizational changes previous version galaxy force domain servers redirect communications generation system genesis database servers servers terminology new configuration interactions mediated hub managed hub script 
major organizational change extract user interface functionality separate audio gui servers simplifying internal responsibilities hub 
addition regularized communication protocols servers share common server shell library 

implementation hub interaction servers controlled scripting language 
script includes list servers specifying host port set operations server supports set programs 
program consists set rules rule specifies operation rule fire list input output variables rule optional store retrieve variables come discourse history 
rule fires input variables packaged token sent server handles operation 
hub expects server return token containing output variables time 
option output variables case interaction way 
input output variables recorded hub internal master token 
discourse history rule context tracking retrieve domain store example rule hub script 
updated rule specified 
conditions consist simple logical arithmetic tests values typed variables master token 
hub communicates various servers standardized frame protocol 
particular dialogue session initiated user interaction graphical interface web site direct telephone dialup desktop agent 
current plan support graphical spoken interactions multiple users simultaneously single hub instantiation record current status session input output language current domain dialogue history separately maintained hub 
tokens multiple simultaneous sessions compete server resources specified hub script 

example rule example rule shown 
rule states exists generated denoted call context tracking operation sending discourse module evaluation 
send previous history define context retrieved hub history record logged session 
operation completed return token hub containing updated version commitment particular domain user query expanded include augmentations due inheritance rules 
updated stored history record context utterance 

program flow control simple communication protocol adopted standardized hub server interactions 
initiation hub handshakes specified servers confirming running sending welcome token may contain initialization information specified hub script 
hub launches wait loop servers continuously polled return tokens token named corresponding program hub script may contain rule index locate place program execution token id associate appropriate master token hub internal memory 
rule consulted determine variables update master variables store discourse history 
master token evaluated complete set rules subsequent rule index rules pass test conditions executed 
current servers spontaneously send tokens hub having received token hub 
sequential constraints easily eliminated leading architecture type control 
implementation usual case rule fires simultaneous rule executions implement parallelism feature exploited example nbest processing 
servers implement userinterface functions typically stateless history may need sent back hub associated current utterance 
common state shared multiple servers 
execute rule new token created master token containing subset variables specified variables rule question 
token sent server assigned execution operation specified rule 
determined designated server busy replied preceding rule dialogue competing dialogue token queued transmission 
hub theory stalled waiting server receive token 
hub checks server sent token tokens input queue 
pop queue returning wait loop 
far experimented best lists outputs recognizer opposed word graphs example 
recognizer sends hub hypothesis separate token signalling completion special final token 
tokens utterance jointly considered frame construction gather server omitted simplicity takes consideration quality hypothesis meaning analysis specially selecting salient words cities focus jupiter example dialogue context 
early decisions hypothesis perfect final decision delayed hypothesis processed 
gather server responsible rejecting utterance system judges hypotheses implausible 
selected token processed discourse inheritance hub script sent dialogue manager 
dialogue manager usually initiates order retrieve information database 
composes frame sent genesis paraphrasing sql output string passed database retrieval 
retrieved database entries returned dialogue manager interpretation 
activities controlled separate program hub script refer module module 
dialogue manager sends reply frame hub passed generation synthesis 
synthesized speech transmitted user audio server freed listening user utterance 

system development tools hub run debugging mode hub script stepped rule time 
hub script controls specification variables recorded log file useful debugging device 
spoken waveforms automatically recorded file system training 
hub contains special internal server handles meta level commands manipulate history record scratch clear history server provides session management asynchronous support functions 
server compiled top server shell library provides convenient routines interfacing hub support mechanism top level scripting language manage program flow described 
language similar hub simpler protocol 
mechanism far database domain servers managing dialogue control expect incorporate nl servers 
communications various servers routed hub 
high data rate messages speech waveforms brokered hub order reduce network load 
audio server sends hub token informing impending waveform 
hub consults existing recognizer servers dictated hub script determine free receive waveform time directs free recognizer receive waveform data directly audio server 
envision recognizers jointly servicing simultaneous conversations resource sharing place utterance utterance basis contrasted assigning recognizer duration dialogue efficient 

semantic frame representation expect researchers utilizing galaxy ii system developing servers need interface suite existing servers place 
cases necessary servers share common language representations jointly process 
researchers choose replace servers free meaning representations find convenient 
intent replace subset servers example new dialogue manager new language generation server new server adopt meaning representation protocol replaced component 
think appropriate provide brief description meaning representation formats adopted systems 
process developing conversational systems multiple domains decade constructed minimal linguistic specification meaning representation feel adequate applications interest 
tina system outputs semantic frames format gen system paraphrase multiple languages representation 
discourse component depends critically format proper functioning domain servers construct reply frames format input synthesizer 
view linguistic semantic world consisting main types constituents call clause topic clause constituent generally occurs highest level usually represents high level goal user request example display record repeat reserve topics generally correspond noun phrases predicates typically attributes expressed verb phrases prepositional phrases adjective phrases 
semantic frame named typed structure somewhat different intent usual definitions terms 
clause display topic flight number pl predicate topic city name boston predicate topic city name denver example semantic frame sentence show flights boston denver types 
semantic frames contain contents library tools available manipulating contents 
traditional linguistic contents include optional topic zero predicates 
frame contain set key value pairs key symbol string value integer string semantic frame list values categories 
key value notation syntactic features number quantification 
conjunction encoded conj key distinguished name key named entities 
key value notation generic allowed represent information need record example database retrievals semantic frame format 
instance key airline value united retrieved database 
fact token sent hub servers instance semantic frame highest level utilizes key value feature frame 
example semantic frame sentence show flights boston denver shown
