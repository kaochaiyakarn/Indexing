initial phase data acquisition effort completed june involved recording preliminary verification utterances produced different speakers different languages 
second phase effort underway involves orthographic transcriptions subjective judgments call native speakers individual languages 
choice languages languages currently corpus english persian french german korean japanese mandarin chinese spanish selected combination linguistic considerations availability native speakers united states 
languages represent range unrelated languages german languages sub family languages english german romance languages french spanish 
languages include various prosodic features mandarin chinese tonal languages japanese uses pitch accents syllabic mora 
addition linguistic characteristics languages represent important geographic political regions speakers languages relatively easily speech corpus originally collected support research automatic language identification 
approaches language identification rely discriminators patterns sounds sound classes important corpus include pairs languages phonologically similar quite distinct 
example syllable patterns chinese similar basically consonant vowel cv consonant vowel consonant cvc patterns relatively limited consonant repertoire characteristic tonal contour associated syllable 
contrast german english relatively elaborated syllable structures potential clusters half dozen consonants vowel nuclei distinctive tonal contrasts syllable level
