similarity important concept advanced retrieval data mining applications 
thesis discussed problem defining similarity distance notion objects especially case binary valued attributes event sequences 
started considering chapter similarity objects similarity notions needed 
defined similarity terms complementary notion distance described properties expect distance measure 
opinion distance measure metric pseudometric 
easy efficient compute 
furthermore measure natural capture true similarity objects 
chapter various ways defining similarity binary valued attributes 
started considering traditional internal measures similarity 
value internal measure similarity attributes purely values columns attributes 
measures cases useful unfortunately reflect certain kinds similarity 
moved discuss external measures attribute similarity 
introduced external similarity measure determines distance attributes considering values selected set attributes 
selected attributes called probe attributes 
gave experimental results internal external measures attribute similarity reallife data sets reuters newswire data course enrollment data department computer science university helsinki 
results experiments showed clearly internal external measures truly describe different aspects data 
various probe sets gave different similarity notions 
probe set defines point view similarity judged 
chapter studied similarity event sequences determined 
similarity numerical sequences studied widely far know ones consider similarity sequences event type occurrence time pairs 
main intuition defining similarity event sequences reflect amount needed convert event sequence 
formalized notion edit distance sequences showed measure efficiently computed dynamic programming 
gave experimental results real life data sets telecommunication alarm data log www page requests 
results showed definition distance event sequences produces intuitively appropriate notion similarity 
studied kind influence associating different costs edit operations transformations various costs get different notions similarity 
chapter described possibility similarity notions described earlier chapters clustering attributes event sequences similarity 
standard agglomerative hierarchical clustering methods experiments 
defined set clustering measures distance tightness quality clustering 
measures selecting best clustering hierarchy clusterings 
experiments real life data sets data sets binary valued attributes sets event sequences considered earlier chapters 
results showed hierarchical methods produce natural clusterings sets attributes event sequences 
difference clustering trees reflect different similarity notions 
hierarchies clusterings different depending clustering method similarity notion 
interesting problems remain open 
considering attribute similarity questions semiautomatic probe selection provide guidance user selecting proper set probe attributes 
examine proposed variations external measure influence distance values 
furthermore experiments determine usability external distances various application domains 
studying attribute hierarchies rule discovery extending external measure distance attribute values worth investigating 
event sequence similarity developed 
important problem examine thoroughly influence different values parameters edit distances 
need extend edit operation set substitution events examine change influences distance values 
extension mean attribute similarity determining similarity event sequences 
experimentation needed determine usability edit distance various application domains 
considering types notions edit distance defining similarity event sequences useful
