network intrusion detection system ida retrieves information related intrusions target systems network mobile agents 
simultaneously agents trace intruders 
ida detects intrusions information collected route intrusion 
mainly describes ida retrieves information traces intrusions 
computer break ins mainly divided types break ins outside lan inside lan 
rare case intruders directly attack target host hosts 
reason logical intruders desire conceal origin 
intruders tend attack protected hosts gradually approaching hosts armed stronger protection ultimately working reaching target hosts 
commonly administrators target hosts intermediate hosts notice intrusion 
furthermore administrators trace origin intrusion network connection closed intrusion detected 
information technology promotion agency ipa japan developing network intrusion detection system ids called intrusion detection agent system ida employs mobile agents goal avoiding problems experienced conventional idss 
ida function mobile agents trace intruders collecting information related intrusion intrusion route decide fact intrusion occurred 
functions enable efficient information retrieval possible detect compromised intermediate hosts 
furthermore ida detects intrusions new intrusion detection model features distinct conventional 
consequently ida reduces overhead system detects new unknown forms attack

methodology intrusions detected divided categories follows 
ffl anomaly intrusion detection ffl misuse intrusion detection anomaly intrusion detection system records users activities systems builds statistical profiles activities records 
regards activities differ remarkably normal intrusions 
misuse intrusion detection refers intrusions follow defined intrusion patterns written system advance 
misuse intrusion detection new unknown forms attack anomaly intrusion detection ineffective detecting insider attacks intrusion detection system employs methods limited range intrusions detect 
intrusion detection systems intend avoid pitfalls usually involve concurrent employment misuse anomaly techniques 
anomaly intrusion detection portion system large slow result impractical average site ids employs techniques 
current trend research ids detecting intrusions efficiently detecting intrusions precisely 
developing ida propose new intrusion detection model place denning model

ida accumulates data required intrusion route tracing network con various processes running system target system advance 

sensor target system seeks mlsi system log 

sensor detects mlsi reports manager 

manager dispatches tracing agent target system mlsi detected 

tracing agent arrives target system activates agent 

information gathering agent collects information related mlsi target system 

activating information gathering agent tracing agent investigates point origin mlsi effort identify user remote site
