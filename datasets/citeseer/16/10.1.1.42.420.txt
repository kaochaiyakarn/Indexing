background filesystems metadata directories inodes free block maps gives structure raw storage capacity 
metadata provides pointers descriptions linking multiple disk sectors files identifying files 
useful persistent storage filesystem maintain integrity metadata face unpredictable system crashes power interruptions operating system failures 
crashes usually result loss information volatile main memory information non volatile storage disk consistent deterministically reconstruct coherent filesystem state 
specifically disk image filesystem dangling pointers uninitialized space ambiguous resource ownership caused multiple pointers unreferenced live resources 
maintaining invariants generally requires sequencing atomic grouping updates small disk metadata objects 
traditionally bsd fast filesystem ffs mckusick derivatives hav synchronous writes properly sequence stable storage changes 
example creating file bsd system involves allocating initializing new inode filling new directory entry point 
synchronous write approach filesystem forces application creates file wait disk write initializes disk inode

update dependencies bsd fast filesystem important filesystem operations consist series related modifications separate metadata structures 
ensure recoverability presence unpredictable failures modifications propagated stable storage specific order 
example creating new file filesystem allocates inode initializes constructs directory entry points 
system goes new directory entry written disk initialized inode written consistency may compromised contents disk inode unknown 
ensure metadata consistency initialized inode reach stable storage new directory entry 
refer requirement update dependency safely writing directory entry depends writing inode 
ordering constraints map simple rules point structure initialized inode initialized directory entry 
re resource previous pointers inode pointer data block nullified disk block may re allocated new inode 
reset old pointer live resource new pointer set renaming file remove old name inode new name written 
section describes update dependencies arise bsd ffs assuming basic understanding bsd ffs described mckusick 
bsd ffs activities require update ordering ensure post crash recoverability file creation file removal directory creation directory removal file directory rename block allocation indirect block manipulation free map management

tw bitmaps maintain allocation information resources 
inode filesystem inode bitmap bit set inode cleared free 
block filesystem data block bitmap bit set block free cleared 
ffs filesystem broken pieces referred cylinder groups 
cylinder group cylinder group block contains bitmaps inodes data blocks residing cylinder group 
large filesystem organization allows just sub pieces filesystem bitmap actively brought kernel memory 
active cylinder group blocks stored separate buffer written disk independently cylinder group blocks 
file created metadata structures located separate blocks modified 
new inode initialized type field set new file type link count set show live referenced directory permission fields set specified fields set default values 
second inode bitmap modified show inode allocated 
third new directory entry filled new name pointer new inode 
ensure bitmaps reflect allocated resources bitmap written disk inode directory entry 
inode unknown state initialized disk rule specifies update dependency requiring relevant inode written relevant directory entry 
strictly necessary bsd fast filesystem implementations immediately write directory block system call creating file returns 
second synchronous write ensures filename stable storage application fsync system call 
done fsync call able find unwritten directory blocks containing name file write disk 
similar update dependency inode directory entry exists adding second name file hard link addition second name requires filesystem increment link count inode write inode disk entry may appear directory 
file deleted directory block inode block cylinder group bitmaps modified 
directory block relevant directory entry removed usually inode pointer 
inode block relevant inode type field link count block pointers zeroed 
deleted file blocks inode added appropriate free block inode maps 
rule specifies update dependencies directory entry inode inode modified free map bits 
keep link count conservatively high reduce complexity practice update dependency directory entry inode exist removing multiple names hard links file 
creation removal directories largely described regular files 
entry link child directory parent adds additional update dependencies 
specifically creation parent link count incremented disk new directory pointer written 
likewise removal parent link count decremented removed directory pointer nullified 
note implicit deleting child directory pointer corresponding directory block 
new block allocated bitmap location updated reflect block contents initialized newly written data zeros 
addition pointer new block added inode indirect block see 
ensure disk bitmap reflects allocated resources bitmap written disk pointer 
contents newly allocated disk location unknown rule specifies update dependency new block pointer 
enforcing update dependency synchronous writes reduce data creation throughput factor ganger patt implementations ignore regular data blocks 
implementation decision reduces integrity security newly allocated blocks generally contain previously deleted file data 
soft updates allows block allocations protected way performance reduction 
manipulation indirect blocks introduce fundamentally different update dependencies merit separate discussion 
allocation indirect blocks blocks pointed indirect blocks discussed 
file deletion specifically de allocation interesting indirect blocks 
inode way identify indirect blocks blocks connected directly indirectly inode pointer indirect block eliminate recoverable pointers said blocks

partial truncation file update dependencies indirect block pointers pointed blocks exist 
ffs implementations exploit distinction ev en significant effect time required remove large file 
file renamed directory entries affected 
new entry new name created set point relevant inode old entry removed 
rule states new entry written disk old entry removed avoid having file unreferenced reboot 
link counts kept conservatively rename involves disk updates sequence increment inode link count add new directory entry remove old directory entry decrement link count 
new name existed addition new directory entry acts step file removal discussed 
interestingly rename posix file operation really wants atomic update multiple user visible metadata structures provide ideal semantics 
posix require said semantics implementations provide 
active filesystem bitmaps change constantly 
copy bitmaps kernel memory differs copy stored disk 
system halts writing state bitmaps allocated inodes data blocks may reflected date copies bitmaps disk

fsync system call 
important filesystem interface accessed fsync system call 
system call requests specified file written stable storage system call return associated writes completed 
prototype soft update implementation implement fsync system call 
task completing fsync requires simply writing file dirty data blocks disk 
requires unwritten directory entries file written unwritten directories file root filesystem 
simply getting data blocks disk major task 
system check see bitmap inode written finding bitmap writing necessary

unwritten data blocks go disk 
data blocks level indirect blocks newly allocated blocks written followed double indirect blocks triple level indirect blocks 
inode written ensure contents file stable store 
ensuring names file stable store requires data structures determine uncommitted names directories occur 
directory containing uncommitted name soft update code go set flush operations just done file 
fsync system call ultimately done synchronously mean flushing operations done synchronously 
sets bitmaps data blocks pushed disk queue soft update code waits writes complete

bsd ffs allows forcible filesystems allows take place filesystem actively required additional support 
removing directories 
prototype implementation oversimplified sequencing updates involved removing directory 
specifically prototype allowed removal directory name removal entry proceed parallel

fsck modified repair problem acceptable fsck bypassed crash recovery 
correct operation directory entry removed directory persistently unlinked 
correcting soft updates code introduced delay minutes unlinked directory really deallocated entry removed 
directory entry really removed link count parent decremented 
user removed directories link count parent reflected minutes 
delayed link count decrement caused questions users caused applications break 
example rmdir system call remove directory link count 
restriction means directory directories removed removed directories fully deleted 
fix link count problems bsd soft updates implementation augments inode field new field called

bsd soft updates code uses single dependency structure associated disk block describe block allocation 
single dependency structure associated bitmap inode related block allocation structures linked lists headed structures 
block allocation structure linked allocated block list bitmap list inode list 
constructing lists separate structures demand memory reduced percent 
daily operation additional dynamic memory load placed kernel memory allocation area equal amount memory vnodes plus inodes

restriction slows rate soft updates normally remove files considerably faster traditional synchronous write filesystem 
steady state soft update remove algorithm requires disk write files removed traditional filesystem requires writes file removed 
fsck utility 
dual tracking true effective link count changes needed fsck evident operational experience 
non soft updates filesystem implementation file removal happens milliseconds 
short period time directory entry removed inode deallocated 
system crashes bulk tree removal operation usually inodes lacking directory entries rare instances may 
contrast system running soft updates seconds may elapse times directory entry deleted inode deallocated 
system crashes bulk tree removal operation usually tens hundreds inodes lacking directory entries 
historically fsck placed unreferenced inodes lost directory 
action reasonable filesystem damaged disk failure results loss directories 
results incorrect action lost directory full partially deleted files running soft updates 
fsck program modified check filesystem running soft updates clear saving unreferenced inodes determined unexpected damage occurred filesystem case files saved lost 
peripheral benefit soft updates fsck trust allocation information bitmaps

inodes marked may free marked free 
partial file truncation

creates slightly complicated update dependencies including need deallocation dependencies indirect blocks need consider partially deleted data blocks
