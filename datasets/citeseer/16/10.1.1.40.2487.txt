answer set iff answer set having answer set called consistent 
definition answer sets reduces gelfond lifschitz gl edp 
negation failure head introduces additional utilities logic programming 
particular rule useful rule states true answer sets flg 
reflexive transitive relation defined elements elements say priority write oe priority relation elements including variables tuples variables stands relation instances prioritized logic program plp defined pair set priority relations elements declarative semantics plp defined answer sets 
plp suppose distinct answer sets means iff preferable written element ns element ii element oe relation answer sets defined reflexive transitive preference relation defined closure 
preference definition means holds iff element priority higher element priority strictly higher note condition ii automatically satisfied priority consider contradictory answer set lp interested consistent theories 
relation chained different elements implies 
answer set called preferred answer set answer set short implies answer set definition answer set finite number answer sets 
particular answer sets coincide answer sets 
clear program unique answer set unique answer set 
prioritization plp necessarily monotonic increasing priorities decrease answer sets 
example answer sets fa cg fbg fbg fa cg 
plp useful program multiple answer sets programmer wants filter preference 
instance indefinite aspects disjunctive logic programming reduced plp 
example program battery dead ignition damaged turn key start turn key start rule attributes failure starting car battery ignition 
reasoner empirically knows ignition causes problem frequently battery 
situation expressed priority relation ignition damaged battery dead answer set turn key start battery dead note situation expressed stratified program 
rewriting rule battery dead turn key start ignition damaged perfect model stratified program 
static stratification useful situation changes dynamically 
suppose reasoner finds car radio works integrity constraint battery dead radio saying radio dead battery 
case wants get alternative solution ignition damaged obtained stratified program 
contrast radio added presence integrity constraint answer set turn key start radio ignition damaged intended 
plp select appropriate answer sets change situation 
note knowledge irrelevant priority relations affected selection answer sets 
example suppose program disjunctive rule replaced battery dead ignition damaged cold morning turn key start cold morning priority disjuncts 
case addition turn key start cold morning answer set definition

abduction abduction inference explanations consider abductive logic programming 
review framework abductive logic programming terms 
definition due 
set literals called abducibles 
abductive logic program alp represented augmented disjunctive rules mean abducible assumed 
alp ground atom represents observation 
set explanation answer set explanation iff answer set example program wet shoes wet grass wet grass wet grass sprinkler sprinkler sprinkler sprinkler abducibles 
observation wet shoes program answer sets wet shoes wet grass wet shoes wet grass sprinkler wet shoes wet grass sprinkler imply sprinkler sprinkler possible explanations abductive reasoning selecting best explanations candidate explanations important problem 
particular minimal explanations usually preferred simplest assumptions explain observation 
explanation minimal ae explanation 
minimal abduction expressed plp follows 
definition alp minimal abduction defined plp definition priority relation read happen 
priority condition effect eliminating abducible answer set possible 
answer set called minimal answer set ae results hold

case minimal explanations containing selected best explanations 
example suppose reasoner sprinkler reason exists prefer sprinkler 
case sprinkler unique answer set implies preferred minimal explanation default reasoning default reasoning basic mechanism commonsense reasoning 
poole poo proposed simple framework default reasoning reformulated inoue ino context logic programming follows 
knowledge system defined pair representing facts defaults respectively 
extension base defined answer set maximal subset ground instances consistent 
example knowledge system lies penguin bird penguin bird polly penguin tweety lies bird unique extension base bird polly penguin tweety bird tweety lies polly lies tweety note default rule applied polly tweety ff lies tweety inconsistent 
abduction minimal hypotheses preferred explain observation

rule head body transformed rules head ffi body ffi ffi represents variables appearing rule ffi uniquely associated rule 
ffi introduced relation ffi ffi 
transformation rule says corresponding default rule effective priority relations express default rules normally hold

example knowledge system example expressed plp lies penguin bird penguin bird polly penguin tweety lies ffi bird ffi ffi ffi ffi unique answer set bird penguin bird lies lies ffi corresponds extension base consider default theory containing conflicting default rules 
example knowledge system example rule lies penguin placed default rule 
addition alternative extension base bird penguin bird lies lies situation knowledge system alternative extension bases preferred specific extension 
select right extension default rule penguin preferred bird 
plp specify priorities default rules
