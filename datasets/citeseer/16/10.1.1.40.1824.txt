general user model strategy explained user model scoring terms second language acquisition useful model communication tool designed people severe speech motor impairments 
people augmentative communication devices speech synthesis text output help communicate rate communication typically slow order words minute 
factors augmentative communication users develop telegraphic language patterns early age 
addition certain cognitive educational difficulties result incomplete knowledge english structure grammar resulting language variations diverse inverted word ordering 
communication tool working uses natural language processing technique termed compression expansion expands telegraphic input syntactically semantically formed sentences mccoy 
example input john go store yesterday prototype augmentative communication system produce john went store yesterday 
course difficulties successfully providing accurate complete interpretations see mccoy overview system 
phases processing word order parser thought accepting variant standard english captures telegraphic speech word order variations expected users 
words resulting mal rules may shared second language acquisition applications

addition may potentially ambiguous interpretations errors properly identifying errors major step 
example john gone store incorrect wrong past tense form john went store missing auxiliary verb john gone store 
combination factors generate set possible corrections 
deciding correction appropriate difficult
