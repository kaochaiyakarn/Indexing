palette response 
times slide changes powerpoint depends slide content size 
test presentations graphics intensive files averaging slides stored megabytes files 
average time slides file switched presentation display palette observed seconds 
keyboard control switch previously displayed slides requires small fraction second 
difficult notice quantify difference switching new slides compared palette 
average time consecutively cumulatively loading slides files seconds file 
average time palette switch slides different files opened powerpoint seconds 
multiple file access supported powerpoint slide show viewer comparable palette 
resulting palette system implemented programs running window nt converter controller 
presentation converter create palette cards presentation 
controller runs presentation responsible accepting scanned input codes printed cards displaying appropriate electronic slides 
palette converter standalone program reads file created presentation authoring software currently powerpoint creates document currently microsoft word containing content presentation layout suitable printing card stock 
card represents content slide contains elements thumbnail slide image speech notes slide number sequence presentation file computer readable identification code barcode indicating presentation number slide 
converter positions elements output document image fit neatly card stock

converter saves copy presentation central location filename consistent card identification code records actions central log 
palette converter implemented visual basic applications vba visual basic primitives extract elements powerpoint presentations manipulate word 
converter runs printed cards control presentation palette controller 
palette controller uses client server architecture 
client accepts input barcode reader server carries commands operate powerpoint 
palette client implemented java 
client runs remotely communicates server pc tcp network interface 
client listens input barcode reader attached keyboard port serial input rs port client pc 
data reader includes filename powerpoint file slide number special control command merging multiple slides composite slide changing background color slides stopping presentation

tacit interaction palette efforts explore new human computer interface paradigm call paradigm tacit interaction 
tacit interaction combines concerns technology engage wider range human perception enable larger degree interaction current interfaces 
paradigm palette explores ways human computer interaction hci allow user distribute tasks intentional intellectual modes action 
need new interaction paradigms tacit interaction growing traditional graphical user interface develops reaches limit usefulness 
problems may classified concerning intentionality attention 
intentionality 
office workers experience increased need shift back forth multiple applications communication appliances applications assume user ready dedicated interaction engage applications appeal interaction 
example print tells user print job ready print popping modal alert blocking user engaged release computer alert 
devices appliances surrounded serviced similar demands 
forcing computer multiplexing scheme user suggest technology adapt human way dealing parallel demands distributing tasks automatic semi automatic modes action involve motor skills body 
open problem challenge hci understand re parts human computer interaction palette step 
attention 
focus perception increasingly competing demands attention 
example microsoft powerpoint pop slide menu stage manager tools slide show unique functions including additional windows presentation control see 
presentation rooms controls audio video room environment commonly dedicated pc audience demanding presenter attention 
continuing fill user focal space tacit interaction paradigm suggests utilize wider range perception include peripheral modes environment 
palette user attentional focus ways partly relieving user computer desktop partly making essential objects manipulation physical providing affordance known index card 
palette expands way previous peripheral awareness system 
technology developed tacit interaction currently involves interface approaches address loading activities cognitive system utilized areas peripheral ranges senses motor system 
reduce need keeping mind complex steps explicitly invoking system operation physical objects tangible representations interface content control strategy 
example placing palette card select slide easily accomplished finding adjusting popup slide menu control window general observe direct physical action efficient reliable gui style interaction 
second reduce need cognitively demanding decision making reducing choice appliance strategy 
example packaging palette appliance provide powerful self contained device suited specialized task selecting displaying information audience 
third reduce need decision making deriving decision data environment sensor strategy 
sensor technology enables detect actions progress aids system responding user intent 
palette uses sensors detect identity action presenter palette card decision making aspect explored detail system 
focusing long term deployment palette busy conference room business organization 
experience help refine strategy tacit interaction method allow generalize concept applications tasks accomplished similar manner 
results integrated findings peripheral perception low intentional interaction explored context system 
parallel expanding design space include sensor strategy 
palette new interface allows user control electronic slide shows having handle computer attention away primary task communicating audience 
design system observation presentations real setting 
interaction paradigm direct manipulation physical objects representing slide content overcomes current interface limitations focal perception demand attention 
palette produced new kinds presentation practices collaborative presentation arising affordances new approach
