users organizations seek provision functionality dependence features specific browser particular browser provider 
support groups effectively system enable communication members issues documents interest 
interest supporting asynchronous communication 
electronic mail newsgroups known support tools asynchronous communication provide natural mechanism group discussions regarding shared document spaces documents accessible world wide web servers 
describes innovative approach enabling group members independently create share commentary content documents accessible web 
particular system described supports creation presentation viewing control user created meta information displayed corresponding documents stored separately 
typical mechanism support annotations documents accessed browsing clients web 
example members corporate functional team may wish create shared evolving commentary strategy documents stored private web server may wish comment public information offered competitor web site 
example research group may course collaboration institution wish join ongoing discussion joint design documents hosted institution 
suggested user created meta information may ways annotations trails voting seals approval support notions editorial control communication medium 
usage scenario illustrates aspects target usage model 
user viewing document web favorite browser notices department colleagues added comment regarding sentence document 
user asks view comment comment opportunity respond 
decides comment document 
invokes annotation submission mechanism 
creating text annotation providing subject header citing relevant url submits annotation 
user notices annotation available viewing authorized members group 
furthermore annotation system notifies group members annotation interest posted 
contrast approaches system described depend changes specializations web browsers servers 
system takes advantage notion application specific stream transducers functionality system provided specialized proxy la 
systems da la ncsa mosaic group annotations cgi script running server provide annotation support 
design choice forces user direct requests explicitly server reasonable choice documents annotated reside controlled server 
believe restrictive able create commentary documents accessible server 
annotations systems may attached document author defined locations may constraining productive group interaction 
public annotation system gr prototype uses cgi support modified server making support hard servers 
system separates functionality annotation system meta information server storing annotations separately target documents client side component querying target document server synthesizing responses 
approach provides autonomy potential scalability unfortunately ties user interface query synthesis functionality particular browser implementation strategy inordinately restricts user community forces implementers tightly integrated browser implementations 
address potential drawbacks hypothesized specialized stream transducer provide flexible browser independent annotation support 
stated brooks suggest classes client server applications network transactions substantial value may arise inserting communication stream application specific transducers may view potentially alter message contents 
testing hypothesis context world wide web building sample set proxy transducers bound request response stream 
approach extends standard www architecture way believe novel useful 
initial prototype group annotation transducer served proof concept support hypothesis 
facilitate construction initial prototype borrowed elements prototype system stanford university relies modified mosaic browser embedded annotation support 
strictly necessary stanford prototype demonstrate value approach reasonable step system design led naturally proxy approach acknowledged 
subsequent architecture retains lessons detail prototype 
rest proceeds follows 
describe key design considerations 
discuss system architecture review concept application specific stream transducers 
section describes implementation lessons learned 
discuss implications new architectures consider outstanding issues related directions 
design requirements base set functionality wished implement prototype follows requested html document query annotation database merge resulting annotations response coherent html document 
write annotation html document 
target document need controlled user way document author prepare document annotated 
save annotation annotation database 
permit multiple users annotate document sequentially parallel 
write single thread replies annotation 
support attachment annotations specific pieces viewed html document 
support simple model users annotations permits organizational grouping user filtered retrieval access control 
maintain user profile information stamped annotations 
provide simple user interface creating selecting annotations 
initial architecture illustrates initial architecture consisting web browsers web servers annotation specific stream transducer annotation server 
initial architecture annotation transducer annotation server browsers www servers 
original prototype able leverage elements system particular borrowed merge library create synthesized document place annotations store serve annotations initial model users annotations 
comparison illustrates high level design 
architecture modified mosaic browser annotation server www servers 
model users annotations quite simple suited initial purpose approach support complex model 
prototype model individual user may member administratively defined groups 
annotation member administratively defined annotation set set resides annotation server 
conceptually set may represent individual topic area expectation annotations written set related topic interest 
example consider workgroup purchasing department large browsing line catalog competitor parts workgroup may want separate comments component cost running discussion product quality 
situation calls separate sets annotations 
annotation sets provide user primitive way filter annotations suit user purpose 
example member purchasing group concerned moment quality particular part may elect turn annotations cost 
group permitted access annotation sets 
access groups public private 
public access groups joined user service 
private access group joined administrative validation 
goal ensure annotation service support model grouping access control goal met 
purposes prototype important annotations stored easily store retrieve defined mechanism 
current implementation prototype mechanism protocol storage medium slightly adapted version stanford annotation server 
approach describe toolkit build 
discuss user interface technique describe structure transducer 
strand toolkit built toolkit developed osf research institute allow transducer developer focus application specific aspects transducer instances generically refer strands stream daemons 
illustrated toolkit provides outer shell manages connections client server application specific code module placed 
strand architecture developer may program development system create strand code module simply executed strand performs appropriate setup functions 
strand ensures module connected request response stream developer simply operate contents ignore network specific issues 
previous description strand approach reports strand outer shell adds minor user imperceptible delay processing request response streams 
annotation service strand module written executed strand outer shell 
user interface interface interacting annotation service implemented html forms controls 
choice follows design principle modifying browsers servers 
type interface relatively straightforward implement strand module modules deal byte stream level 
interface components support types functions submitting new annotations changing profile changing annotations retrieved behalf 
appends control buttons bottom valid html response forwarding client 
buttons include submit annotation view groups view sets 
system functions provided menus mosaic application 
system user presses control buttons captures resulting request guides user series html interactions 
implementation section describe flow control user views existing annotations submits new ones uses control functions modify preferences 
viewing annotations flow control request reaches module performs steps 
creates thread control handle request response transaction control thread performs remaining steps 

forwards request server specified url 

authenticates user determines user profile determine annotations request step 

authenticates annotation server 
note authentication relationship annotation server user authenticated 
contrast model user authenticates directly 

queries annotation server annotations associated requested url requesting user steps proceed parallel step 

synthesizes returned document associated annotations returns synthetic document client 
synthesize annotations document merge component actions place annotations inserts place markers indicate presence annotations 
marker placed directly target text intra document hyperlink element list appended document 
appends list hyperlinks document 
link corresponds annotation user selects hyperlink list associated annotation appears follow ups html document browser view follow control button 
see 
simple annotation follow 
user interface flow control user interface implementation uses short circuiting technique takes advantage strand ability trap requests certain urls serve 
strand module may send client custom response response returned downstream server 
module may technique send strand generated error messages client failed condition stream processing error 
user interface traps requests correspond command directives stimulated user selection command button previously inserted module 
ways indicate request corresponds command directive 
current implementation uses reserved local host name effectively overridden 
requested url indicates reserved host name module processes query data sent get post method command directive 
command directive change state respect general operation respect user state module change returns dynamically generated document indicate outcome operation 
example user presses view groups button view groups directive sent 
module processes directive sending html form back client 
form includes list groups user current status group set radio buttons associated group 
user status groups may changed selecting appropriate radio buttons 
pressing submit causes directive sent 
directive similar accompanied set arguments indicate changes user group status 
changes processed module returns results changes new html page 
user may continue browsing usual 
case submitting new annotation discussed section 
implications user interface choice discussed lessons learned section 
submitting annotations flow control flow control submitting annotations similar editing group membership 
directives arguments passed processing 
key difference case html form returned client specific writing annotation 
page includes number input fields radio buttons entering annotation text selecting options 
illustrated options allows user attach annotation specific piece text document entering text input box annotation attached document 
form creating annotations option select annotation written displayed plain text html 
command directive sent form submitted contains number arguments posting submission annotation server 
completion module returns results submission user may continue browsing usual 
lessons learned prototype prototype supported hypothesis successfully users able read write annotations configure preferences design requirements met 
group annotation transducer successfully client side browsers explicitly server side running web server advertised address requests server run user selectable service 
problems identified building testing prototype user interface interface elements take space forms interface powerful selection annotation attachment points inelegant annotation server multiple tcp connections slow cgi scripts create significant overhead limited support user directed filtering annotations support multiple reply threads originate single annotation scalable architecture authentication discuss detail 
user interface current graphical user interface gui exploits capabilities html forms 
class markup proved excellent tool prototyping user interface simple somewhat powerful standard browsers 
disadvantages interface production quality system apparent building prototype 
toolbar annotations appended document took space page 
document spanned multiple screens items visible times reading document 
editing user data group membership requires step process go group page submit group page return original html document 
browser augmented approaches offer sophisticated control menus display new windows 
clear version proxy annotation software require smoother interface 
interface remain standard feature browsers market continue goal developing pan browser annotation support 
problem introduced proxy approach selection attachment points annotations document 
natural method selection involves indicating attachment point mouse selecting piece text displayed browser 
straightforward implement approach augments existing browser 
developer direct access important information mouse events internal buffers 
approach browser independent general sense access type information restricted 
workarounds querying window system manager current text selection possible platform browser specific 
order maintain pan browser design goal prototype implements simple html forms interface adds extra frustrating step process selecting point attachment 
direct selection user cut paste target text input box provided form 
annotation submitted perform extra processing order discover redundant information characterizes selected string text 
problems arise selected string text unique document 
handled rejecting annotation outright forcing user new text string making user select correct occurrence list ambiguous phrases 
case processing power user time wasted 
potential mechanisms exist providing cross platform pan browser application specific interface support including tcl tk ous java language class libraries runtime su 
ability run annotation applet client provide elegant solution problems identified prototype 
applet contain toolbar buttons list annotations current document 
longer necessary merge information directly document 
applet persist page page function help extension browser 
expected java run time system integral part web clients remains pan browser solution 
permits innovative presentation interaction techniques virtual layering annotation version meta information top base document 
example implementing inlined annotation markers embedded java applets 
clicking marker pop window displaying annotated text lines annotation 
problems inherent selecting attachment points inlined annotations may solved doing away html forms interface providing functionality annotation system annotation applet 
example user writing annotation applet display stripped textual version html 
section text selected attachment point inlined annotation 
ambiguities longer exist applet working exact point insertion single isolated text string match document 
annotation server prototype uses uses common gateway interface cgi storing retrieving annotations 
approach introduces unnecessary overhead number ways 
requires tcp connection opened query annotation server 
addition scripts provide slow service executed time server receives request 
performance annotation server issue 
prototype annotation server limited capabilities offering primitive database functions 
effective annotation service requires users able filter search annotations flexible set criteria author name date creation annotation type keywords subject header content body 
database system storing annotations user directed filtering fully threaded system replies annotation easier implement 
system implemented release software 
scalable architecture current prototype assumes existence single workgroup uses common local annotation database 
provisions permitting sharing workgroups 
development generation system incorporate interoperability protocol development digital library initiative dli permit annotation server accept requests network clients process requests local database 
permits query annotation databases local annotation databases share annotations indices kinds clients access information 
authentication current specification support proxy authentication 
type authentication needed services provides customized accessing user 
order circumvent problem temporarily developed personal id strand module adds experimental header field request 
field proxy authenticate uses basic authentication method encoded username password identify source request 
problem method requires strand process running client machine introduces extra tcp connection request response transaction 
expected revision protocol contain support proxy authentication multiple intermediate authentication points 
annotation applet include user profile information sent directly required 
adaptation approach taken augmented mosaic implementation 
alternative security features dce demonstrated dce web system le 
futures new architecture illustrates new architecture supporting group annotations experience 
new annotation service architecture architecture derives analysis functionality provided roughly request document referenced url request associated annotations merge document annotations provide user interface manage user state manage annotation user grouping information support user authentication authorization requested access annotations 
believe capabilities rest annotation service annotation intermediary 
consequently new architecture annotation server performs user authentication request authorization storage retrieval annotations 
surprisingly division responsibility similar prototyped system 
functionality accessible clients variety interface modules including ones accepting dce rpc connections 
clients generation annotation strand applications need access annotations web editor versioning mechanism 
interface module performs user authentication passes incoming request including user identity url retrieve annotations known user specific filter core annotation server 
core component uses authorization module perform authorization check ensuring user permitted retrieve specified annotations 
retrieves annotations underlying data store accessed generic annotation oriented interface hides implementation data store variety database systems special purpose annotation storage engine 
positive property architecture clients need specific common access mechanism querying creating annotations 
example annotation server serve clients strong security guarantees dce rpc clients 
similarly interoperability protocol developed digital library initiative offer diverse set clients access annotations maintained variety annotation servers clients annotation servers run different administrative domains 
addition modular approach permits add functionality availability scalability replication index sharing 
functionality prototype focused attaching annotations html documents service really general system attaching different types meta information documents world wide web 
example notion backlinks links pages point current page implemented allowing annotate documents automatically 
user visits page annotation service automatically post annotation contains url referring html document 
list backlink annotations document displayed user request 
example reading page members group cast votes document content appropriateness style 
information stored series annotations 
document fetched contains link document voted votes tallied displayed link 
system create special annotations act landmarks 
landmark contain comment pointers points forward new page points back 
chains landmarks called trails formed manner 
trails created allow people discover information new logical ways 
instructed follow trail completion returning page containing links trail 
important way extend annotation service tie related services versioning mechanism permits annotations created retrieved correspondence appropriate versions documents change 
document search correlation mechanism annotations may searched relevance documents electronic mail newsgroups 
notification mechanism users notified annotations interest 
addressing related services systems 
novel approach supporting creation presentation viewing control user created meta information documents world wide web 
contrast previous approaches mechanism may specialization browser server 
implies certain tradeoffs impacts discussed 
initial goal test applicability strand approach problem goal met quite successfully 
goal build generation annotation support address user interface overhead scalability issues extend functionality new directions
