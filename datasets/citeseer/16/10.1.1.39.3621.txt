market approach call routing telecommunications networks 
system architecture described allows self interested agents representing various network resources potentially owned different real world enterprises ordinate resource allocation decisions assuming priori operation 
argued architecture potential provide distributed robust efficient means traffic management 
particular architecture uses adaptive pricing inventory setting strategy real bidding reduce call blocking simulated telecommunications network 

telecommunications networks call traffic typically routed network source destination basis information traffic path 
path routing carried regard wider impact local choices 
main consequence myopic behaviour heavy traffic conditions network utilised inefficiently rejecting traffic necessary load evenly balanced 
means performing load balancing centrally compute optimal allocations traffic network paths predictions expected traffic bertsekas gallager 
calculations completed network management function configure network routing plan best available resources predicted traffic 
networks grow larger involve complex elements amount operational data monitored processed network management function increases dramatically 
centralised architectures management scalability bounded rate data processed goldszmidt yemini 
addition number known issues algorithms compute optimal network flows progressively poorer performance heavily loaded networks unpredictable oscillation solutions 
furthermore network management function provides single point failure making system inherently robust 
mentioned reasons decentralised approach routing highly desirable 
cases decisions localised information taken multiple points system 
downside local decisions non local effects 
decisions point system affect subsequent decisions system 
ideally localised control take place presence complete information state entire system 
state affairs enable localised controller know consequences choice rest network 
main reasons realised practice 
firstly network dynamic delay propagating information 
means model network state held point prone error 
secondly scaling issues involved making flow optimisation computations entire network noted obtain 
system local decision making takes place presence incomplete view wider network feasible solution providing distributed control 
promising approach combines notion local decision making concerns wider system context agent technology jennings wooldridge 
agents address scaling problem computing solutions locally limited information isolated parts system information social way 
locality enables agents respond rapidly changes network state sociality potentially enable wider impact agents actions coordinated achieve socially desired effect
