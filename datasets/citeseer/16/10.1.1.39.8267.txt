census data census data collected assess trends populations 
crucial issues data representation multi level geographic classification hierarchy 
hierarchy voluminous 
census data collected individuals summarized block level 
may thousands blocks county tens hundreds counties state 
addition cities towns may cross county boundaries 
things worse boundaries blocks counties cities redefined 
temporal component information 
easy see management classification hierarchy structures require sophisticated system

census data discrepancies simple dimensions race age group 
various reasons legislative classification races age groups vary state state county county 
example birth rates collected state level may different race classification 
summarizing states poses special problems 
census data law countries compromise privacy individual 
summarized data available

major issue census bureau reason cell suppression term say cells multidimensional space released summarized form information individuals may inferred 
summary main problem areas complex classification hierarchies discrepancies dimension classifications privacy 
ii economic data type database contains statistics sales income industries consumption productions various products crude oil
