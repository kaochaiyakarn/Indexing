forms superimposed information maintained web search engines derived automatically underlying information space forms web guides hold value added knowledge necessarily contained base information 
view data integration mechanisms contrast typically contain data underlying sources albeit possibly filtered restructured 
second divergence database approaches typically require schema information sources involved assume commonality data structuring
