deontic logic traditionally philosophers analyze structure normative language 
eighties deontic logic revival discovered computer scientists logic formal specification verification wide variety topics computer science overview see 
example deontic logic formally specify soft constraints planning scheduling problems norms 
advantage norm violations create inconsistency formal specification contrast violations hard constraints 
new interest deontic logic arisen multi agent system discipline social norms laws improve coordination cooperation qualitative decision theory norms represent agent goals computer security norms analyze specify security issues electronic commerce :10.1.1.11.6752
study norms particular proceed norm violated 
clearly issue great practical relevance applications norms violated frequently 
fine print contract usually stipulated done term contract violated 
example delivery time due responsible agent obliged pay extra transport warehousing costs result delay 
violation serious intended violating party contracting parties usually want consider breach contracts simply disruption execution contract repaired
