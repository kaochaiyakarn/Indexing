copyright acm architecture metasearch engine supports user information needs eric glover steve lawrence william birmingham lee giles lawrence research nj nec com eecs umich edu nec research institute artificial intelligence laboratory independence way university michigan princeton nj beal avenue ann arbor mi query submitted metasearch engine decisions respect underlying search engines modifications query score results 
decisions typically considering user keyword query neglecting larger information need 
users specific needs research papers homepages able express needs way affects decisions metasearch engine 
describe metasearch engine architecture considers user information need decision 
users different needs keyword query may search different sub search engines different modifications query results ordered differently 
architecture combines powerful approaches single general purpose metasearch engine 
current metasearch engines decisions behalf user consider user complete information need making decisions 
metasearch engine decide sources query modify submitted query best utilize underlying search engines order results 
metasearch engines allow users influence decisions 
primary advantages metasearch engine single search engine increased coverage consistent interface 
study lawrence giles estimated size web indexable pages 
study concluded single search engine covered sixteen percent total 
searching multiple search engines simultaneously metasearch engine coverage increases dramatically searching engine 
lawrence giles combining results major search engines increased coverage estimated size publicly indexable web 
consistent interface necessary metasearch engine useful 
interface ensures results places meaningfully combined insulating user specifics underlying search engines 
describe architecture generation inquirus metasearch tool nec research institute 
architecture shown certain user preferences explicit 
preferences define search strategy specifies source selection query modification result scoring 
allowing user control search strategy provide relevant results specific needs single consistent interface 
typical metasearch engine submits user query minor modifications syntactic consistency set search engines returns results order returned search engines 
order sense user specific need current events research papers 
user information needs sufficiently represented keyword query 
studies shown users consider factors including non topical making relevance judgments 
glover birmingham demonstrated decision theory means re ordering results single screen shot inquirus interface architecture standard metasearch engine search engine capturing user information need text query 
nguyen haddawy demonstrated decision theory means making result ordering decisions 
addition properly ordering results choosing look affects search precision 
increase precision results metasearch engines profusion savvysearch metaseek send user query search engines 
profusion considers performance predicted subject query user explicit search engine preferences 
request profusion downloads individual pages check broken links duplicates 
metaseek considers past results user keywords source selection current version savvysearch allows users specify category determine sources searched 
metasearch engines significantly increase coverage limited engines respect number quality results 
important queries sent underlying search engines best reflect current need user 
popular internet search engines hotbot allow users add extra non topical constraints week language english 
likewise users regular metasearch engine add extra non topical terms hopes increasing precision adding term home query looking homepage 
inquirus metasearch engine nec research institute automatically recommend simple query modifications phrases requiring optional terms results 
inquirus take simple phrases modify better reflect intended meaning 
desirable metasearch engine perform dynamic query modifications maximize result quality search engine 
query modifications increase coverage 
example user normally consider hotbot looking news general purpose search engine 
date constraint possible get valuable topically relevant results available news specific search engine 
hand user searching research papers rule results adding constraint date 
options depends user need applied differently different search engines 
section describes query modifications inquirus detail 
new architecture figures show interface architecture generation inquirus 
architecture explicit notion user preferences includes preferences non topical features 
preferences search strategy choose appropriate search engines query modifications influence order results 
current user interface inquirus provides user list choices user customized list 
choices currently include research papers general introductory individual homepage organizational homepage specification preferences allows users different needs query search different search engines search engines different modified queries results ordered differently 
example user searching research papers information retrieval versus second user looking homepages organizations specializing information retrieval 
users different information needs type keyword query search search engines 
tables show actual results query inquirus system different information needs 
new architecture built top inquirus guarantees consistent scoring results download inquirus automatically changes query refers means helps

inquirus opens decisions source selection query modification document scoring 
decision described detail 
choosing search engine preferences specify sources shown 
currently search strategies human generated 
includes learning techniques improve source selection decision 
metasearch engines metaseek profusion savvysearch allow user control search engines chosen 
engines experimental methods automatic source selection user query 
metaseek considers performance history keywords profusion considers predicted subject query 
savvysearch currently allows users choose category uses search engines specific category prototype automatic source selection predicted recall query 
difficulty automatic source selection metric compare sources 
metric number results returned average query subject 
metric similar recall measure ir assumes returned results relevant 
unfortunately necessarily correlation number results returned usefulness results 
simple example user searching news president clinton may find fewer results site dedicated news large general purpose search engine results news site necessarily valuable user 
metaseek attempted consider user satisfaction results query sense collaborative definition sources user feedback 
approach considers user statements result values assumes user valuations mapped query true mapping needs queries 
example just previous users felt photos real dogs cartoon dogs bad mean new user agree 
part search strategy inquirus contains function predicting value documents 
function specific individual user 
reasonable model user value possible determine source need average opposed associating worth source query 
evaluating worth source need query possible reasonable judgments previously unseen queries 
user looking news usually prefer results site dedicated news result general purpose search engine regardless query 
modifying query problems metasearch engine dependence underlying search engines provide reasonable set results 
just search engine contains results current user need guarantee results returned query 
simple example user searching hotbot current events linux 
query linux search engine may return thousands pages linux news oriented 
compound problem search engines limit number results returned user altavista limit urls 
limit result pages seen user 
enhance precision results deal problems caused search engine result limits inquirus profusion done savvysearch relied number results returned search engine 
allows query modification 
types modification performed search engine specific options sort date constrain language prepending terms appending terms 
query modification method causing underlying search engines provide valuable results information need 
method modification advantage specific options 
search engines provide ability influence result ordering add constraints 
example addition constraint language 
second example instructing search engine sort results date 
choice options depends user information need keyword query 
second modification adds keywords 
depending user information need desirable locate pages type 
example research typically contain sections 
adding keywords query density research papers similar precision significantly increased 
important note query modification affect scoring function documents scored user provided query preferences modification 
inquirus allows query terms added provided query 
information need category general resources types modification 
modification prepending query adds keywords resources links
