quantaloid category hom set complete lattice join usually denoted ii composition morphisms distributes sides arbitrary joins 

quantaloid morphism functor hom sets induces join preserving maps fa fb 
example clat quantaloid complete lattices join preserving maps join maps computed pointwise 
quantaloid object commonly known unital quantale quantaloid morphism object known unital quantale morphism rosenthal 
subcategory quantaloid closed inherited join morphisms 
full subcategory quantaloid selecting quantaloid certain morphisms keeping objects gives rise inherited join morphisms internal 
parset denote category sets partially defined functions called kernel partially defined function written power functor defined parset clat pf sets mapped powersets partially defined functions mapped direct image mapping union preserving map

clat morphism corresponds map written pointwise union pj clat maps automatically preserves unions 
clat morphism corresponds map preserves unions
