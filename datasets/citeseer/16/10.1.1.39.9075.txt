briefly summarise details may 
general criteria various general criteria born mind creating definitions organising ontology 
fact evaluation criteria 
important ones adapted reported :10.1.1.122.3207
clarity definitions maximally clear unambiguous expressed natural language formally encoded 
examples possible illustrate aiai tr page intended negative examples useful clearly show intended mistakes may anticipated state underlying assumptions especially explicitly formalised axioms 
consistency coherence ontology internally consistent circularity avoided especially formal encoding desired 
externally consistent terms best conform common usage 
avoid introducing new terms consult dictionaries thesauri technical glossaries 
extensibility reusability ontology designed way maximise subsequent reuse extensibility 
achieved getting right balance specific perform required tasks specific little 
formal coding symbol level biases avoided purely convenience notation implementation 
helps careful avoid introducing terms mean roughly thing identify key underlying term reuse define terms 
achieves parsimony turn facilitates reusability 
guidelines specific guidelines assist identifying terms producing definitions go middle choosing terms define proceed middle fashion top bottom 
choice go top middle bottom number effects 
bottom approach results high level detail 
turn increases effort difficult spot commonality related concepts increases risk inconsistencies leads turn re effort 
middle approach enterprise project successfully years part developed ibm problems noted largely avoided 
handling ambiguity reach agreement terms ambiguously concentrate underlying ideas ignoring terms 
define related idea inventing meaningless labels decide important idea lastly choose appropriate terms 
evaluation revision cycle various sorts criteria may evaluate ontology 
general apply ontology specific particular example
