section examines maintenance tools 
maintenance agents filters world wide web collection maintenance tools necessary digital library 
examples tools briefly consider potential mechanisms reducing user maintenance cost continued world wide web 
examples limited 
issues exist informal materials mechanisms dealing may 
example trying capture traffic usenet groups require methods summarizing series messages 
web valuable testbed dealing maintenance issues 
additionally computer science pre press materials available web web serves salient immediately useful example 
web shares maintenance problems hypertext systems 
example hypertext collection web needs check nodes link 
distributed system web site may longer exist node may moved 
node link changed vanished local notification 
determine nodes links orphans entry points local area 
check information nodes obsolete examining expiration dates objects 
standard web clients provide type information nodes links consistency checking types feasible 
similarly versioning generally supported checking correct version 
semi autonomous agents attempt ameliorate web maintenance problems 
agents list problems omission mechanisms meant suggestive required broadly construed library 
multi owner maintenance spider automatically traverse focused portion web 
valuable checking portion web local collection 
identifies items require owner attention broken links moved documents modified documents owned objects expiration dates near current date 
provide index document traversed hypertext document 
conceptually earlier tool answer garden substrate 
automatic maintenance obviates need continuous manual traversal web collection 
web may traversed owner site document tree possible mark areas spider avoid 
efficiency reasons performs traversal perspective site administrator 
furthermore analyze changed materials see changes significant user 
centralized focus harder individuals personal collections limits ability customize maintenance process focus needs 
web lookout web lookout semi autonomous agent periodically examine compiled list interesting web nodes areas 
web lookout determine links nodes added removed changed 
purpose web lookout avoid manual maintenance 
major automate examination hot lists favorites pages 
fairly common web individuals nodes links individuals interesting nodes 
interesting nodes may associated topic example computer mediated communication web agents making extremely valuable researchers 
additionally individuals may pages pointers progress pre press published papers informal descriptions projects data 
pointers extremely valuable researchers 
unfortunately examination way know author added new link 
similarly know author added nodes web area providing new descriptions progress project 
having manually traverse lists look new items web lookout allows users automate process 
robots periodically examine specific locations change web lookout notifies user interesting changes 
heuristic examines nodes specifics content link changes 
example user looking new publications colleague request web lookout note local link added colleague publication page 
scenario user probably interested links deleted text added web lookout notify user things instructed 
web lookout determine content significantly changed measured similarity metric user set localized web area changed shape individuals stopped finding particular link interesting 
web lookout place results web page 
ability obtain automatic notifications changes parts web complements social practice providing interesting links 
serves useful social filter similar effect mechanism maltz ehrlich pointer filter 
web lookout parlance active filter maltz ehrlich require author notify potential users 
web lookout removes notification bottleneck 
limitations maintenance agents major issue informal material 
informal material advantage timely vanishes 
return material captured permanent store 
agent deals problem 
permanently storing informal materials central location prohibitively expensive 
essentially duplicates traditional problem selecting bibliographic universe 
select handful threaten rest collection cost 
costs individual user may large 
possible user require substantial storage simple mirroring process adequate 
empirical investigation user habits required determine feasible 
limitation inadequacy computational method examining content 
robots fully examine intellectual content informal information attempt partially examine contents may require extensive network resources 
tried consider design web lookout uses resources manual traversal 
careful consideration need paid tradeoff efficiency usefulness
