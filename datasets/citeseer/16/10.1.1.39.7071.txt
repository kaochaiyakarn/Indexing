salowe produces bounded degree spanner algorithm modifying yao graph construction described earlier may unbounded degree 
idea simply add edges spanner order weight adding edge edge added having angle close 
salowe reports similar degree bound applies spanner ruppert seidel appears erroneous 
possible keep track edge added graph step construction shortest edge certain range angles connecting points incident edges range combining ruppert seidel modified yao graph orthogonal range searching technique method eppstein maintaining bichromatic closest pairs dynamically 
result log time algorithm construct bounded degree spanner 
seen arya smid achieved similar time bound alternate bounded degree spanner 
bounded degree spanner construction credited vaidya feder nisan 
arya improved time bounds methods 
results arya include log time algorithm constructing spanner bounded dilation bounded degree weight constant factor times minimum spanning tree 
give log algorithm constructing spanner bounded dilation paths log edges bounded degree weight log times minimum spanning tree 
idea finding short paths edges previously considered arya mount smid 
fixed dilation quickly find spanners bounded degree 
problem turned tradeoff asked small degree possible achieve bounded dilation 
salowe find degree bounds grow dimension problem showed dimension degree graph constant dilation 
salowe starts bounded degree methods discussed 
salowe method reducing degree cluster points nearest neighbor forest clusters roughly halve degree spanner construction method 
starting initial bounded degree spanner method described iterating degree reduction process produces result 
contains convenient classification spanner literature terms parameters dilation time number edges weight degree class metric space spanners defined 
salowe include bound total weight spanners 
das improved degree bound showing dimension graph maximum degree dn edges constant dilation depending total weight log times minimum spanning tree weight 
state dimensions weight reduced times minimum spanning tree weight 
technique involves similar nearest neighbor forest clustering methods salowe applied somewhat carefully combined greedy spanners constructed chandra 
weight bound comes summing weight greedy spanner nearest neighbor forest subgraph minimum spanning tree small weight 
combining result das constant weight bounds greedy spanner construction yields result
