motivation process save storage space retrieval time systems enormous database

frequency information useful retrieved documents ranked 
words available information possibly indices frequency counts document identifier appeared stored database

queries parsed keywords possibly syntactic constituents boolean operators 
example user enters apple banana system may parse input apple banana system may parse apple banana 
stage parsed query terms may stemmed 
match query terms document representatives system performs similarity matching comparing 
set relevant documents system enforces constraints set boolean operators 
example food filter documents relating food topic 
systems relevance feedback increase precision search results
