terminology definition errors associated software development done different groups working relative isolation section gives terminology consistent newcombe newcombe newcombe fellegi sunter 
product space files match pair represents business entity pair represents different entities 
single list duplicate record represents business entity record list 
regard pairs ab may necessary consider pairs agree certain identifiers blocking criteria 
blocking criteria called pockets sort keys 
instance making detailed comparisons pairs lists records representing businesses state may sufficient consider set pairs agree postal zip code 
missed matches false nonmatches agree set blocking criteria 
record linkage decision rule rule designates pair link possible link 
possible links pairs identifying information sufficient determine pair match 
typically clerks review possible links decide match status 
list agricultural entities name information sufficient deciding john smith jr rural route john smith rural route represent unit 
second john smith may john smith jr may represent father grandfather 
false matches nonmatches erroneously designated links decision rule 
false nonmatches matches designated decision rule applied set pairs matches set pairs decision rule applied 
generally link refers designations decision rules match refers true status 
matching variables common identifiers names addresses annual receipts tax code numbers identify matches 
possible establishment name john smith parsed components name john initial surname smith business keyword 
parse allows better comparison name information improve matching accuracy 
similarly address east main road parsed location number direction east street name main street type road 
matching variables necessarily uniquely identify matches 
instance constructing frame retail establishments city name information hamburger heaven may allow proper linkage hamburger heaven locations 
addition address information may help establishments different addresses different lists 
situation insufficient information separate new units existing units different mailing addresses associated 
matching weight score number assigned pair simplifies assignment link status decision rules 
procedure matching variable distinguishing power better able delineate matches nonmatches 
establishment name refers name associated business institution agricultural entity 

improved computer assisted matching methods historically record linkage consisted entirely clerical procedures clerks reviewed lists obtained additional information matching information missing contradictory linkage decisions cases rules developed 
bring pairs detailed review clerks typically reviewed listings sorted alphabetically name address characteristics 
name contained unusual typographical variation clerks find matches 
files large matches separated pages matches reviewed 
extensive training clerks matching decisions inconsistent 
required extensive review 
major update required training new sets clerks 
disadvantages computer matching software development may require person years proficient computer scientists existing software may optimally files having characteristics significantly different developed 
advantages automated methods far outweigh disadvantages 
situations identifiers available computer algorithms fast accurate yield reproducible results 
second search strategies far faster effective applied clerks 
example best computer algorithms allow searches spelling variations key identifiers 
third computer algorithms better account relative distinguishing power combinations matching fields input files vary 
particular algorithms deal relative frequency combinations identifiers occur 
example describes creation mailing lists census agriculture 
dramatically illustrates enhanced computer matching techniques reduce costs improve quality 
produce address list duplicates identified records taken different sources 
absolute numbers comparable proportions multiplied times base 
listings reviewed manually unknown proportion duplicates remained files 
development effective name parsing adequate address parsing software allowed creation ad hoc computer algorithm automatically designating links creating subsets efficient clerical review 
pairs records agreeing postal zip code ad hoc computer algorithm combination surname information character name numeric address information designate percent records duplicates percent possible duplicates reviewed 
person hours clerks months identifying additional duplicates percent 
duplicates located subsequent estimates list may compromised 
algorithms developed fellegi sunter model effective computer algorithms dealing typographical errors 
computer software designated percent file duplicates percent needing clerical review 
person hours needed identify additional duplicates percent 
clerical review computer procedures identified duplicates combination computer clerical procedures 
cost development software 
rates duplicates identified computer plus clerical procedures percent percent 
computer procedures lasted days contrast computer plus clerical procedure needed months 
adjunct computer operations clerical review needed dealing pairs having significant amounts missing information typographical error contradictory information

standardization parsing lists appropriate parsing name address components crucial part computerized record linkage 
true matches erroneously designated common identifying information compared 
specific types establishment lists drastic effect parsing failure quantified winkler 
presents overview ideas needed parsing standardizing addresses 
parsing names requires similar ideas 

standardization name address components basic ideas standardization replace spelling variations commonly occurring words standard spellings fixed set abbreviations spellings certain key words standardization hints parsing subroutines 
standardizing names words little distinguishing power limited replaced consistent abbreviations respectively 
name spelling variations rob replaced consistent assumed original spelling robert identifying root word refer woman legal name 
purpose standardization allow name parsing software better presenting names consistently separating name components little value matching 
establishment associated words incorporated encountered flags set force entrance different name parsing routines encountered names encountered 
standardization addresses operates standardization names 
words road rural route typically replaced appropriate abbreviations 
instance variant rural route encountered flag set forces parsing set routines different set routines associated house number street name type address 
lists containing city state province postal code combinations available national postal services sources say city names address lists placed form consistent list 

parsing name address components parsing divides free form name field common set components compared 
parsing algorithms hints words standardized 
instance words cause parsing algorithms enter different subroutines words dr 
table examples table word smith name component identifying information 
pre refers prefix post post refer bus bus refer commonly occurring words associated businesses 
exact character character comparison standardized unparsed names yield matches subcomponent name smith help designate pairs links 
parsing algorithms available deal name types names john smith lastname types smith john 
available accurately parse types names single file 
humans easily compare types addresses associate corresponding subcomponents free form addresses 
effective matching software requires corresponding address subcomponents identified locations 
examples table show parsing software divides free form address field set corresponding subcomponents identified locations 
table 
examples names main difficulty business names properly parsed identifying information may indeterminate 
example table pairs refer business entities survey frame 
alternatively table pair refers different business entities name subcomponents similar 
tables name information tables may sufficient accurately determining match status address information identifying characteristics may obtained clerical review 
additional address information indeterminate establishments pair may need contacted 

matching decision rules projects automated matching decision rules developed ad hoc intuitive approaches 
instance decision rule pair agrees specific characteristics agrees set characteristics designate pair link pair agrees specific characteristics designate pair possible link designate pair 
ad hoc rules easily developed may yield results 
disadvantage ad hoc rules may applicable pairs different defining rule 
users seldom evaluate ad hoc rules respect false match false rates
