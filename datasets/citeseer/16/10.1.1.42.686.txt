investigate methods 
clear natural method representation row bins 
define block row maximal consecutive sequence text bins 
suppose th row different blocks say ordered left right

distance measure referred edit distance 
edit distance appears measure accurately captures differences rows computationally unattractive lengths large 
edit distance disadvantage comes clustering 
particular collection block sequences form cluster desirable able compute cluster center determine block sequence minimizes sum distances block sequences cluster 
obvious cluster center computed 
leaves unsatisfactory option choosing cluster center block sequences collection minimizes sum distances 
introduce computationally simpler method overcomes clustering difficulty edit distance 
scheme manhattan distance distance vectors manhattan distance jx gamma order manhattan distance need represent row fixed length vector 
fact row represented vector length defined follows 
define gamma gamma gamma case 
call vector interval encoding
