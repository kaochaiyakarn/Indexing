inter agent conflict resolution order agents team agents need exchange necessary commitments 
agent offering commitment commitment imposes constraints local activities receiving agent commitment intended satisfy constraints agent local activities proceed successfully 
clearly agent consistent state constraints including constraints due local commitments satisfied local planning satisfied commitments received non local commitments 
deciding set commitments leads agents consistent states key agent coordination 
conceptually centralized planner search set appropriate commitments knows capabilities constraints goals agent preventing conflict occurring 
multi agent system may undesirable impossible centralized approach 
agents need decisions locally exchange commitments decentralized manner partial knowledge belief desire intentions 
due inter dependency agent tasks resources inter dependency commitments uncertainties associated agent activities conflicts commitments occur results unsatisfied constraints 
resolve conflicts agents need common mechanism decide actions take temporally sequence activities interactions predefined set social rules may purpose 
research focus general approach support range approaches socially defined commitments dynamic construction commitments explicit agent conversation negotiation 
view protocols conversations family coordination mechanisms gpgp gpgp framework 
gpgp gpgp family coordination mechanisms defined covering exchange non local viewpoints results coordination hard soft interrelationships resource usage 
typically set agents needs coordinate task resource interrelationship instantiate conversation process tries form commitments address interrelationship 
course proposed commitment may depend task resource interrelationship triggers conversation process 
possible agents may conflicting opinions proposed commitment lead objections counter proposals 
case iterations negotiation process may needed 
commitment negotiation framework provides set message types iterative conversation continue 
message types conveyed allow agent specify intentions regarding commitment question request propose accept decline counter propose change change decommit 
messages allow dynamic update state commitment update fulfilled failure 
coordination mechanism utilize subset message construct conversation protocol suits purpose 
agents choice set coordination mechanisms effort willing spend negotiation depending specific problem solving situation 
example agents coordinating enables relationship meaning task ff agent ff start task fi agent fi finished non zero quality dialogue initiated ff fi 
coordination mechanisms agent ff proactively offer commitment fi knows highly fi may need enablement 
hand agents reactive mechanism 
case fi initiates dialogue explicitly requesting deadline commitment ff task ff complete time agent ff reacts request search possible proposal 
depending constrained agent ff may propose commitment promises finish ff time requested time agent fi needs study received offer may issue counter propose turn agent ff may change proposal 
new round negotiation initiated 
choice may depend time allowed quality cost requirements mix reasoning agent due temporal resource constraints problem solving 
true self interested interaction cooperative interaction 
conversation terminates commitment accepted involved agents agents realize commitment unattainable constraints agents constrained agents choose abort conversation cost coordination time sensitive environment 
mentioned failure resolve conflict level may indicate need conflict resolution levels 
protocols define ways agents exchange information undergo negotiation reach consensus domain independent way agents need domain strategies negotiation order negotiation process effective efficient productive 
example agents need know agents need compromises conflict occurs 
realize occurred 
answer questions agents need model utility order reach social decisions 
self interested agents agents try maximize local utilities order agent may negotiate tasks locally pay cost having agents solving subproblem cost remote resource accesses 
cooperative agents goal maximize utility system depends local utilities agents 
means agents may need pursue locally optimal goal return increase global utility 
case negotiation directed exchange utilities agents 
focus negotiation locating agents satisfy task resource constraint improvement utility produced 
associate commitment marginal costs utility difference having having commitment 
way commitments direct influences agent local decision drive negotiation social 
complex inter agent negotiation involves multi linked negotiation 
issue multi linked negotiation arises multiple resources acquired order solve problem agent needs agents solve subproblems turn subproblem resource interdependency temporal requirements 
example multi linked negotiation logistic supply chain 
solve problem efficient flexible manner may require agents develop organization knowledge share meta level knowledge agent workload resource usage profile 
agents need able perform negotiation reactive proactive manner 
example agent ff needs result task fi agent fi time fi turn needs resource ff possesses 
ff knowledge linkage fi resource may proactively offer fi resource time requests deadline commitment fi 
allow agents reduce amount iteration needed complete negotiation reduces complexity negotiation

various time considered different patterns interaction components 
common schedule driven model set goals task structure local scheduler domain expert 
research goal represented tms modeling language hierarchical structure tasks 
scheduler generates schedule possibly alternates prespecified satisficing criteria 
schedule passed coordination component attempts implement schedule negotiation 
coordination may take form acquiring commitments resources controlled agents don commitments ensure availability decentralized resource scheduled time contracting general meta level information larger context particular coordination episode place beneficial serve focus coordination activities supplement communication information exchange 
tasks agents 
mechanisms results obtains coordination process schedule implemented 
negotiator unable implement schedule additional constraints placed scheduling component re invoked produce new schedule 
model course agent attempting implement schedule agents trying implement schedules 
commitments agents coordination component reflected constraints local control 
coordination model driven output local scheduler incoming requests agents local coordination component reactive 
complex model negotiation component may take proactive role attempting secure critical commitments advance generating complete schedule 
idea increase likelihood generated schedule fact implemented example securing highly contested resources early process 
distributed search perspective think approach form backtracking avoidance 
particularly effective self interested agents operating resource constrained environments incentive negotiate early possible 
challenge model balance aggressiveness agents meeting individual needs social concerns fairness global utility 
protocols allow agents decommit cost useful give agents freedom commitments may need providing incentive decommit early possible 
third model inspired contingency scheduling allows coordination tightly integrated executing schedule form actions triggered execution monitor class tasks scheduled execution domain level tasks 
example contingency schedule may contain failure recovery actions certain resource non local task requirements 
coordination component sure appropriate commitments place advance schedule checkpoint determined failure fact occurred 
agent may choose trigger decommitment branch schedule include failure recovery option 
similarly failure recovery branch may trigger decommitment actions 
incentives cooperative self interested release commitments earliest opportunity 
individual agent delayed decommitment missed opportunity recover cost 
social cost associated decommitment comes late released resources agents 
balance cost time complicated fact just agent incentives social individual decommit early may reasons retain unused commitments rescheduling activities necessary 
second model scheduler existing commitments reduce uncertainty schedule stability system may benefit agents conservative releasing commitments 
intend investigate complex set tradeoffs research 
notice models mutually exclusive 
model enabled progressively complex bidirectional interaction local scheduling coordination components 
see complex intra agent mechanisms reasonable responses complexity inter agent environment 
view observe interesting tradeoff attempts implement socially desirable outcomes protocol design call complex intra agent dialog part individual agent 
example consider distributed scheduling application resource constrained environment agent receives set goals resource requirements accomplished certain deadlines quality criteria 
environment agents limited resource negotiation agents perform tasks locally authors assume external resources resources controlled agents primary goal maximize utilization controlled resources 
assumed self interested agents interested implementing individual schedules lowest possible cost meeting deadlines quality criteria 
assumed cooperative agents interested minimizing cost agents meeting deadlines quality criteria 
consider case agents schedule driven model 
task arrival schedule generation coordination happens asynchronously agents agents attempt acquire resources schedules generated locally 
pathologies described easily arise model highly environments 
agents get schedules sooner better chance acquiring resources 
means underloaded agents schedules significantly complex compute advantage 
designer possible responses scenario 
cooperative setting agents may adopt mechanisms proposed tend reduce parallelism effect synchronizing resource acquisition achieve globally desirable allocations 
absence incentive synchronize agents starved resources may find advantageous adopt aggressive strategy resource acquisition acquiring resources advance scheduling actual 
agents monitor resource demand attempt acquire resources critical schedules demand rises certain threshold 
resources acquired agents place constraints scheduler induce bias schedules resources acquired 
resources due scheduler inability create schedules 
cost unused resources improvement schedule utility strategy paid self interested agent 
system stakeholders confronted situation satisfaction 
agents system designers observe real resource utilization decreased total amount resources acquired agents 
agents successfully implemented schedules may done higher cost required need acquire increase prices comes high demand resources 
response introduce sophisticated protocols allow agents decommit penalty total cost reservation find holding reserved resources 
agents provided incentive release unneeded resources early possible minimize penalty precise nature incentive remains interesting research topic
