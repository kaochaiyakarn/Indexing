years argumentation particularly powerful areas knowledge representation commonsense reasoning logic programming legal reasoning decision negotiation 
argumentation setting provided extensions semantics logic programming bondarenko dung kowalski toni :10.1.1.37.5420
new understanding dialectics contributed knowledge representation reasoning formalisms legal applications ai provide outstanding examples successful new ideas ai revise philosophy field practice 
research area led finding common foundations extended logic programming procedural argumentative frameworks prakken sartor prakken sartor 
negotiation argument games loui loui opened new way conceptualizing computation posing old questions concerning judgment agreement decision making social choice 
prior research argumentation developed decade demonstrative non reasoning basis formal languages modeling computation non demonstrative reasoning confined logical models argument delta special informal linguistic systems 
argumentation presents natural tool characterizing kinds reasoning attractive approach major goal ai modeling commonsense reasoning 
achieved promising results ahead
