distributed revision control world wide web jurgen reuter stefan james hunt walter tichy ipd university karlsruhe karlsruhe germany summary 
revision control long standard part software development 
enormous expansion internet increasing means communicating geographically dispersed software developers need distributed version control internet acute 
order address need authors developed revision control server world wide web www rce outgrowth rcs 
proves possible highlights strengths weaknesses hyper text mark language standard www browsers netscape tm mosaic accomplish goal 

programs revision control available software engineers decade 
best known examples rcs sccs 
relatively revision control available locally 
network mount file system containing revision control archives archives accessed remote login ftp obtain system access appropriate system access archive 
clearcase introduced distributed revision control system number geographically separated groups 
accessing archive requires access host archive versioned object base resides 
situations type access desirable 
example scenario companies collaborate short term project may wish full access machines 
relatively unrestricted access needed shared source code 
example supporting working home free lance software development 
firm may want maintain control source code risk unrestricted dial access 
obvious solution situations develop revision control system client server architecture 
type architecture quite successfully window system world wide web 
gives users net including dial network protocols ppp slip potential access archives need login server machine 
access control archives authors reached jjh tichy ira uka de respectively jurgen reuter stefan james hunt walter tichy managed totally independently host login process

existing world wide browsers leaves interface format client side system 
mentioned successful client server systems available platform window system world wide web www 
designed support distribution documents 
goal covers half client side needs distributed revision control system selective transmission data server client managing user interaction 
www client server model clients request documents number servers network 
interface format www hyper text mark language 
html offers means describing documents user interfaces machine independent form 
contains mechanism uniquely locating documents servers internet 
client program www browser responsible interpreting html presenting result user user responses appropriate server 
distributed revision control world wide web combining components rce www build full distributed revision control system

means system take advantage enormous base existing www clients 
small additions client side needed transfer revisions data client server 

world wide revision control prototype authors succeeded building prototype system named world wide revision control 
diving architecture user perspective wwrc system action 
provide insight works 
screen dumps show different stages user dialog involved checking revision 
wwrc server generates html pages automatically rce archives 
popular example www browser netscape tm screen shots taken wwrc prototype implementation written modula running sun sparc sunos 
user actions consist selecting item button clicking 
adding items lists entering text fields comments involves keyboard 
wwrc server handles actions accordingly produces new html page result login user access archives give name password 
server checks database uses tell different connections apart enforce access rights database quite different system login database 
user verified archives belonging server 
revision archive handling login user select archive perform various operations show log file revision graph 
allow easy access frequently archives user define pickup list directly choose archives 
administration functions changing wwrc password online help offered 
exception check process necessitates transfer data html files described architecture section

successful check distributed revision control world wide web revision graphs revision graph view shows selected archive revisions 
subgraphs hidden shown give clearer overview 
selecting revision displays information time stamps author state commentary revision 
graph displayed formatted text shown 
saves network bandwidth compared dynamically generating pictures 
check revision selected checked transferred user machine 
done internally just www browser small helper application subject section 
user just clicks check button gets confirmation check success 
functions functionality described just representative selection 
wwrc rce functions accessible internet 
checking files adding comments selecting files creating new revisions supported 

challenges order develop prototype necessary overcome problems 
large amounts data transferred automatically particularly back server 
consistency maintained stateless protocol 
actions inherently separate html combined produce comfortable user interface 
getting information server purpose www automatically storing information defined place client machine asking user directions supported 
transferring larger amounts data www browser server far trivial 
html offers forms user input adequate automatic data transfer megabyte range 
suitable mechanism check check file transfer necessary 
wwrc server fit www paradigm glance 
keep state information user inherently stateless 
server perform rce functions api generate www pages showing archive control information fly 
furthermore response user action pressing form button server limited just generating kind reply create jurgen reuter stefan james hunt walter tichy new www page containing updated information transfer data 
just ordinary www server follow link load file postscript document 
cases preferable 

architecture brief look beneath hood wwrc help clarify wwrc manages standard www browsers afore described user interface 
tackle bidirectional file transfer problem wwrc uses concept helper applications 
small programs www browser calls order display kinds data visualize 
example browser receiving postscript file 
loading file may start ghostscript application display 
adding new helper application just involves adding file type calling procedure browser configuration files 
easily done user 
idea perform check check concept check request server local check file machine special directory unique wwrc user 
transfer checked file transmits header stating file name directory position administrative information includes file contents 
type generated transfer file set causes browser call new helper application checkout transfer file 
application reads header determines user directory tree resulting file created writes file contents sends back confirmation directly server stating file received successfully 
server marks locally checked file expired remove automatically request html page 
case transmission failed concept allows user request file 
illustrates process 
similarly perform check user file server server transmits dummy file stating user file transfer 
corresponding helper application reads file client machine 
connects directly server puts file special directory checked server archive 
server knows archive put file user belongs administrative information dummy file sent back file 
file paths taken relative root directory server point user directory tree file structures point client server 
existing file uniquely renamed avoid overwriting 
distributed revision control world wide web server client directories directories time www browser show tree checkout viewer start viewer local checkout omitted clarity select file checkout header file type checkout checkout decode header write file data file received acknowledge user host network 
client root process process process select tree view 
wwrc server wwrc server wwrc server 
server root wwrc host fig 

internal processes check server helper application complete control connection original data server kept reception confirmed client 
means protocol implemented handle possible losses connection large file transfers encrypt data transfer 
concepts known internet community adapted wwrc current implementation prototype support functionality 
second problem protocol solved adding necessary information urls 
addition server keeps internal database user recording information current file user pickup list 
keep user going back browser history accessed pages perform actions pages content date wwrc keeps time stamp page warns user tries outdated forms 
state information necessary wwrc server process started anew client request 
allows multiple servers active rising throughput system server know resume 
achieved combining user information urls state information database 
jurgen reuter stefan james hunt walter tichy page data question elegant solution platform browser independent 
problem pressing button example check file transmits data described cause file transmitted www page shown browser updated 
means longer reflects state archive check 
obvious cure add text page making user aware behavior press continue button directly check 
leaves possibilities errors 

related main aspects distributed revision control world wide web transport medium computer supported cooperative cscw 
mentioned clearcase provides distributed revision control requires users login accounts machine archives stored 
bscw example system uses world wide web basis cscw support deltas revision trees 
wwrc system authors know supports 

demonstrates possibility world wide web distributed revision control 
approach taken client side machineindependent portable adding new client architecture just means porting small checkin checkout helper applications making cosmetic changes existing browser configuration file 
furthermore techniques may convert applications clientserver architectures www internet 

current system working condition shown plans improve usability efficiency security functionality 
usability enhanced cleaning user interface integrating user side utility programs 
aside improving layout html pages generated provisions need added handle files time 
integration ability step backwards previous sides forward needs bit support distributed revision control world wide web maintain consistency 
java replace helper application support advanced functions portable manner 
efficiency improved means 
server faster daemon interact web server starting new large server process transaction 
data automatically compressed improve transfer time check check 
general need limit access revision control system 
password verification data sent net protected snooping 
needs addressed data encryption mentioned 
currently wwrc version supporting multi allowing user check complete set files development 
concurrent accesses possible conflicts handled underlying rce locking concept server extended avoid deadlocks increase efficiency 
example system needs support case simultaneous user requests intersect contain files 
eventually list approach needs extended check sets facilities managing large projects 
system communication forum developers help coordinate development large project 
configuration management wwrc effective distributed project management tool
