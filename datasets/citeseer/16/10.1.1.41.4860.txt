tokenizer 
main task scan text order identify boundaries words complex expressions mecklenburg expand abbreviations 
lexicon 
lexicon contains stem entries subcategorization frames describing information lexical analysis chunk parsing 
furthermore domain specific part lexicon associates word stems concepts available concept taxonomy 
case defined set concepts domain specific part lexicon contains entries referring concepts 
lexical analysis uses lexicon perform morphological analysis identification canonical common stem set related word forms analysis compounds recognition name entities retrieval domain specific information part speech tagging 
german compounds extremely frequent analysis parts database data base crucial may yield interesting relationships concepts 
furthermore morphological analysis returns possible readings words concerned noun verb reading word man old man boats 
processing named entities includes recognition proper names hotel schwarzer adler single complex entities recognition transformation complex time date expressions canonical format january st 

step associates single words complex expressions concept ontology corresponding entry domain specific part lexicon exists

part speech tagging disambiguates reading returned morphological analysis words complex expressions local context 
chunk parser 
smes uses weighted finite state transducers efficiently process phrasal sentential patterns 
parser works phrasal level analyzes sentence 
grammatical functions subject direct object determined dependency sentential structure basis frames lexicon 
dependency relations 
primary output derived smes consists dependency relations lexical analysis compound processing parsing phrase sentential level 
important approach levels syntactic dependency relations coincide closely semantic relations hold entities cf

text mining algorithm text mining mechanism algorithm discovering generalized association rules proposed srikant agrawal 
algorithm represent known application data mining viz 
finding associations occur items supermarket products set transactions customers purchases describes appropriate level abstraction purchased drinks chips purchased beer purchased soda 
basic association rule algorithm provided set transactions transaction consists set items item set concepts 
algorithm computes association rules measures support confidence exceed user defined thresholds 
support rule percentage transactions contain subset confidence defined percentage transactions seen appears transaction viz 
support confidence srikant agrawal extended basic mechanism determine associations right level taxonomy formally taxonomic relation 
purpose extend transaction include ancestor particular item 
compute confidence support possible association rules contain ancestor trivially valid association 
prune association rules subsumed ancestral rule itemsets contain ancestors identical items corresponding itemset 
discovery conceptual relations may directly build scheme described steps summarize learning module 
determine 

determine support association rules 
determine confidence association rules port step 
exceed user defined sup 
output association rules exceed user defined confidence step pruned ancestral rules higher equal confidence support 
reader may note chosen baseline approach considering determination set transactions may conceive strategies cluster multiple concept pairs transaction 
instance assume set texts describing particular hotel detail 
hotel come address elaborate description different types public private rooms furnishing resulting concept pairs returned linguistic processing 
baseline choice considers concept pair transaction 
support rule hotel address equal probably far rules rooms furnishing style room bed achieve ratings percentage points
