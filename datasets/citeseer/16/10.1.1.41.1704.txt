intrusive mean sensor operation form factor doesn fit natural flow user activities 
uncertain sensors provide best guess results trusted confidence factor low 
unreliable sensors known failure modes usually identified 
active badges popular choice sensing presence identity location people building

review available sensors exhaustive shows single sensor allows sense presence identity reliably satisfying usability requirements 
sensors mentioned suffer similar shortcomings 
consider combining multiple sensors 
combining sensors combining multiple sensors raises problem fusing information meaningful way 
inspired sensor fusion literature envision general sensor fusion mechanisms competitive complementary sensors 
competitive sensors competitive sensors provide equivalent information environment 
redundancy particularly useful sensors uncertain unreliable

smart floor provides uncertain results 
sensors simultaneously location entry point building combine output offset respective unreliability compensate uncertainty smart floor 
users come expect possible failure technique correct sensing 
techniques provide correct sensing results matched improve quality result
