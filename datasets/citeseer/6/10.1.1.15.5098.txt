proposes extend current knowledge management systems functionalities support organization better managing tacit knowledge help engage users continuous dynamic knowledge exchange provide tailored active support users particular take account competence role organization social network cognitive style 
approach operationalized providing mechanisms support social processes trust building group formation coordination proactive software agents increase level interactivity stimulate knowledge exchange personalizing possible interaction selection presentation content order maximize impact knowledge delivered 
different examples help illustrate approach applied variety application contexts 
existing knowledge management systems take full advantage possibilities offered current technologies essentially designed reflect classic document centered approach managing knowledge 
classic approaches advantages instance providing users powerful means access manipulate huge amount formalized formalizable knowledge organization 
major limitations take sufficiently account knowledge documents knowledge delivered static frequently represented form difficult apply obsolete incomplete disconnected context mode delivery take account specificity user current activity role organization working style leading inefficiency frustration 
limitations particularly annoying context modern organizations need flexible adaptable large amount knowledge experiences social knowledge know formalized repositories people heads 
objective propose model knowledge management systems extends traditional models mechanisms supporting formalized management knowledge particular knowledge related activities involving strong human social dimension represent key elements performance modern organizations 
part challenges knowledge management approach context modern organization limitations approach 
particular identify knowledge management needs flexibility ability provide employees environment supporting dimensions activities 
second part propose vision generation knowledge management approach tries address needs providing infrastructure supports social process organization provides active interaction high level personalization 
part indicate approach operationalized different mechanisms social components agents personalization components 
illustrate approach applied design knowledge management learning systems variety application contexts 

challenges knowledge management limitations current document centered approaches private public organizations environment operate considerably changed decades 
organizations renew rapidly adapt competitive changing environment flexible past need sophisticated ways managing knowledge assets 
manage efficiently knowledge cycle identification creation reformulation capitalization sharing knowledge particular better support social related processes 
modern organizations aware major part knowledge assets instance people know experience available form tacit knowledge need better support need integrate mechanisms social active mechanisms contribute dynamics circulation exchange knowledge organization need adapt organizational processes specific characteristics corporate users position organization competence cognitive style interest motivation order maximize quality 
consequence knowledge management systems defined support new settings particular knowledge related activities knowledge workers considerably evolved decade 
whilst plethora knowledge management systems developed take advantage available technologies fall short fulfilling needs 
systems emerged document centric approaches able support efficiently fraction knowledge cycle classifying storing retrieving knowledge 
systems main limitations limitation related management tacit knowledge 
limitation related capability engage users continuous active dynamic knowledge exchange 
limitation related support specificity user account interaction particular role organization competency cognitive style interest desires motivation 

need support management tacit knowledge traditional knowledge management systems rely assumption knowledge assimilated objects identified separated initial context handled information systems 
definition knowledge restrictive structured explicit 
tacit knowledge includes experience practices skills know people acquire really aware working represents important forms knowledge modern organizations 
managing tacit knowledge increasingly important organizations 
firstly modern organizations continuously changing time codify tacit knowledge explicit knowledge anyway rapidly obsolete justify cost 
secondly knowledge difficult codify particular involves intangible factors subjective insights beliefs perspectives emotions 
thirdly process elicitation may raise strong resistance people consider knowledge personal strategic assets guarantee position organization 
tacit knowledge represents critical element capacity organization learn instance nonaka takeuchi show firm learning efficiency critically depends institutional set facilitates spiral type interaction tacit codified knowledge 
see management tacit knowledge consist providing members community communication means mail bulletin board supporting dynamics social interaction including trust motivation social behaviors attitudes 
pointed erroneous assume people automatically participate online communities engage social exchange reason 
instance social exchanges theories premise voluntary relationships depend receiving satisfactory outcomes person commitment existing relationship proportional satisfaction relationship investment put relationship inversely proportional potential alternative relationships 
establishment sustainable social exchange process group real virtual complex takes time involves factors reaching minimum level trust successful see needs explicitly supported 

need provide active support dynamics exchange knowledge related activity conventional knowledge management systems passive processes manage knowledge knowledge deliver static documents 
usually document centered knowledge management systems propose modes interaction mode user specifies search query form form key words categories domains system returns set documents match query 
search algorithm sophisticated instance take account word synonymy exploit automatic clustering techniques second mode user able locate knowledge browsing pseudo tree categorization knowledge yahoo open directory project system classification illustrates second mode 
modes complementary user knows precisely advance looking express set keywords second user precise idea 
case navigation structure classification helps progressively formulate discover knowledge serendipity 
believe knowledge management systems support actively processes user particular propose knowledge guidance assistance knowledge related activities proactively individual social context 
addition knowledge delivered richer lively form static documents rapidly obsolete require lot effort adapted context actionable 
knowledge particular tacit knowledge delivered story telling informal conversation formal debriefing meeting simulation useful skill acquisition 
active support knowledge processes important 
important knowledge new organization active living people refer knowledge ecology continuously expanding 
knowledge worker need sophisticated search engines deliver passive knowledge time process intelligent mechanisms digest knowledge immediately usable 

need take account specificities user knowledge management systems usually take account specificity user particular usually provide interaction mode users 
form personalization exists customization shallow superficial instance user able specify preferences presentation information position information displayed portal advanced cases able specify interest systems take account filter information displayed 
knowledge management systems go far superficial support user specificity try build deeper understanding user 
understanding include user preferences role organization competencies cognitive style interests desires motivations 
deep understanding user information personalization important 
firstly helps increase personal relevance knowledge delivered reduce cognitive load knowledge management system knows user able deliver useful knowledge intervene appropriately knowledge related processes 
second reason user centered personalized systems may useful defining maintaining expressing identity user facilitating expression user identity social environment management cyber identities 
third reason systems open possibility transform radically tremendously role perception value knowledge management systems 
knowledge management systems deeper understanding user instance personality motivations goals expected develop totally new relationship user virtual companions symbiosis user external tools today
