rc representing context information document technology key goal design bluespace software infrastructure provide environment scales deployed enterprise 
believe infrastructure physical environments seamlessly integral part information technology infrastructure particular integral part network infrastructure 
goal bluespace software infrastructure builds extends key generation internet technologies 
document technology specifically xml xpath xslt soap provides uniform paradigm communication programming 
communication documents represent events state 
event state documents encompass information sensed gathered environment 
ranges running measurements current ambient temperature low level device events motion sensor triggered higher level interpretations user gestures user selected icon 
documents represent commands interactions 
command interaction documents encompass information causes physical logical changes environment 
documents range low level device instructions turn task light higher level representations complete user interfaces html page data set 
document technology provides basis key elements programming bluespace environment 
document oriented approach arrange information space environment 
associations event conditions appropriate responses conditions 
lastly generate manage complete interactions provide uniform experience human user environment 
hierarchical arrangement context state event information bluespace provides mechanism called context distribution service storing retrieving context information 
service various devices agents environment share distribute states events information 
context distribution service operates information blackboard 
provides way naming item information submitting service publishing sharing information retrieving name 
context distribution service arranges information hierarchically flat space names tuples 
similar hierarchical file system provides hierarchy directories publishing individual units information files 
difference context distribution service publishes sets documents sets files 
xml fragment gives example structure representing elements single electronic office 
floor id ldb rc id states occupant true visitors true visitor tony visitor visitors states devices heater devices displays desktop displays floor sample information space single office 
xml document element document representing location information published 
example document representing condition radio frequency active badge reader published location element 
hierarchical structure advantages traditional tuplespace simple flat structure 
hierarchy allows fine level discrimination various elements devices sensors effectors displays environment 
supports presence number different elements type 
additionally provides sufficient representational power scale single environment example large enterprise electronic offices managed 
note individual environments hierarchically structured floors buildings organizations 
hierarchical structure xml structurally isomorphic xml document 
runtime structure fact instance compliant document object model dom data structure 
note state environment easily saved dom xml file 
general results published context distribution service form current model office environment may comprise user activities environmental conditions temperature system configurations types information 
single office gives programmers ability organize rc different events sensor data categories lead understandable code 
improve system performance restricting queries necessary directories 
context distribution service highly programmable providing procedural messaging interfaces accessing manipulating information hierarchical store 
interfaces enable wide variety configurations infrastructure 
interfaces may directly procedural code runs address space service 
form approach useful configurations devices sensors elements environment controlled single locus control example workspace appliance 
interfaces may accessed messaging service exchange xml documents connections current implementation runs directly migrated soap

note client access office environment location appear application messaging interface 
expressions query subscription bluespace provides mechanism accessing shared information hierarchy expression queries subscriptions 
consistent design goal building extending key internet technologies subscription query service xpath expressions standardized specification searching elements nodes attributes xml documents 
expressions access information environment quite simple basic form maps context storage strategies represent information flat tuple oriented naming space 
example locate document providing state active badge device sample context space described simple expression suffice locate information 
course precise specification desired information possible 
example expression floor id ldb id states rc locate particular active badge document particular office particular floor larger physical environment 
note information environment wildcards various levels 
example id states return information state collecting devices office 
bluespace provides support expression subscriptions 
subscription registered query expression identifies locations bluespace context distribution service subscribing agent called listener wishes monitor 
bluespace supports subscriptions storing document expressions describe locations conditions listener wishes monitor changes arrival events 
subscription mechanism listener essentially monitor changes state variety devices agents environment 
unrestricted nature naming hierarchies locations bluespace infrastructure possible application device authors develop conventions rendezvous state event publication process 
particularly useful technique rendezvous strategies convert low level information high level information example sample environment special identification agent identifying humans arriving departing physical environment 
agent subscription facility register low level listener active badge activity environment 
listener subscribe expression 
receiving events badge reader agent retrieve technical data active badge event published 
agent perform database lookup identify human user 
identification agent acts publisher subscriber 
identifying human active badge higher level human identity published appropriate location 
higher level information represents presence human users visitors subscribed agents 
example subscription expression occupant true visitors visitor tony provide appropriate notification specific visitor 
case named tony arrived environment 
bluespace provides programmatic direct interfaces messaging interfaces registering de registering subscriptions identifying listeners delivery subscribed information events 
bluespace provides various forms subscription registration support high degree detail various conditions subscription activated information delivered listener
