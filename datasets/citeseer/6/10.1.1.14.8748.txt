efficiency search algorithm peer networks critically depends peer topology query routing 
approaches centralised distributed hash techniques dhts hybrids widely employed organise peer networks 
centralised search uses specialised nodes maintain index resources available collaborative environment 
resource interest located querying index node identify resource providers 
napster employs efficient centralised search mechanism 
centralised system vulnerable attacks poses difficulties updating indices 
hand dhts widely adopted improve resilience peer peer systems 
examples include chord pastry :10.1.1.140.3129
typical dhts resolve keyword location contents located contents routed 
inherent self organisation attributed distribution keys uniform space node object identifiers share key space 
adopting dhts requires unique hash techniques transform search criterion unique key set 
technique suitable semantic search mechanisms typical semantic search may consist random combination entities relationships 
search technique employed able search set related entities single hash expression 
important aspect differentiates semantic overlay dhts necessity maintain relationships resources case linkbases participants 
dht immediate neighbours share relationship primarily responsible monitoring connectivity neighbouring peers 
collaborative environment arrival peer modifies relationship neighbours potentially discoverable resources added network 
departure peer invalidates relationship neighbouring peers 
scope update limited peer storing discovery information resources peers semantically connected arriving departing peer 
collaborative environments searches required exhaustive 
maximum achievable level recall percentage matches traded better performance system 
keyword search suffice collaborative environment primarily consisting peers resources may may semantically correlated inherently designed utilise relationships keywords terms 
example define term tp parent term tc tp semantically super class tc 
semantically equivalent terms convey similar meanings terms semantics syntactically unequal 
summary discussed peer peer search techniques highly effective systems dynamic content :10.1.1.140.3129
search techniques rely uniqueness search key hashed key entire peer network 
case resources unique types varied instantiations 
aim devise mechanisms allow inspection peers resource type return information occurrences types 
similar problem peer peer networks service discovery addressed 
authors suggest hash techniques generate unique identifier resource case service 
information occurrences services associated hashed keys 
critical approach reasons

hash key represent services bound formation hot spots
