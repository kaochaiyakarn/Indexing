concluding remarks developed new local search algorithm score search approach learning bayesian network structures databases 
main feature algorithm search space dags uses new form representation restricted pdags allows search eciently space similar space equivalence classes dags 
common situation decomposable scoring function set operators de ne neighborhood structure search space scored locally happens space dags evaluate neighboring restricted pdag computing local scores 
way maintain computational eciency space dags ers time explore reduced search space smoother landscape avoids early decisions edge directions 
characteristics may help direct search process better network structures 
experimental results show search method restricted pdags eciently accurately recover complex bayesian network structures data compete state art bayesian network learning algorithms signi cantly improve 
experiments section conducted chickering point search algorithms pdags obtain slightly better results respect ectiveness eciency search methods dags especially highly structured models models perfectly represented dag 
believe pdags useful domains complex contain variables complicated dependence patterns sparse represent independence relationships
