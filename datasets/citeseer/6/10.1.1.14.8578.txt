solution text source discovery problem database selection driven user 
user aware active participant selection process 
different systems follow different approaches approach users browse information different resources 
typical example paradigm yahoo 
www yahoo com 
prospero file system example neuman lets users organize information internet definition sharing customized views different objects services 
different approach keep database metainformation available databases users query database obtain set searchable databases 
example wais kahle provides directory servers master database contains set documents describing english contents database network 
users query master database identified potential databases direct queries databases

gravano disadvantage master database documents written hand cover relevant topics manually kept date underlying database changes 
automatically adds frequently occurring words information server associated description directories servers 
drawback general databases containing relevant documents missed chosen database selection phase 
duda sheldon show sample queries existing relevant servers querying wais directory servers relevant wais servers 
schwartz follows probabilistic approach resource discovery problem presents resource discovery protocol consists phases dissemination phase information contents databases replicated randomly chosen sites search phase randomly chosen sites searched parallel 
sites organized specialization subgraphs node graph reached search process search proceeds subgraph corresponds specialization relevant query executed see schwartz 
shorthand distributed indexing danzig information indexed brokers associated administrative data boolean query called generator rule 
broker indexes necessarily local documents satisfy generator rule 
document added information source brokers generator rules match new document sent descriptor new document 
generator objects associated brokers gathered directory servers queried initially users obtain list brokers generator rules match query see danzig 
barbar clifton ordille miller simpson alonso examples approach users query metainformation databases 
content routing system sheldon address resource discovery problem 
content routing system keeps content label information server generally collection objects attributes describe contents collection 
users assign values content label attributes queries sufficiently small set information servers selected 
users browse possible values content label attribute 
whois directory service www ucdavis edu organizes whois servers distributed directory mesh searched server automatically generates centroid listing words contains different attributes 
centroids gathered index servers turn generate centroid describing contents 
index server centroids may passed index servers 
query index server forwarded index servers centroids match query
