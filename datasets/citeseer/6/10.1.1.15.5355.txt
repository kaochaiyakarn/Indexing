correcting oblique projection distortion illustrated fig 
projection orthogonal surface projected image appear distorted 
correct distortions caused oblique projection shape projected surface image projected inversely distorted prior projection 
general distortion nonlinear computationally expensive 
developed simple scheme uses standard computer graphics hardware computers speed process 
scheme relies fact geometrically speaking cameras projectors focal length identical 
project image distortions sufficient simulate inverse process viewing camera virtual computer graphics world
