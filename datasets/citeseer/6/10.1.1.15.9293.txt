address issue semantics agent communication language 
particular semantics knowledge query manipulation language kqml investigated 
kqml language protocol support communication software agents 
semantic description kqml associates states agent language primitives performatives 
approach describe semantics set reserved kqml performatives 
research offers method speech act theory semantic description language communication acts 
research concerned communication software agents 
see software agents paradigm suggests new way view existing technologies tools build software applications dynamically interact communicate immediate environment user local resources computer system world autonomous semi autonomous task oriented fashion 
crucial component paradigm communication language medium attitudes regarding content exchange software agents communicated communication language suggests content communication assertion request form query knowledge query manipulation language kqml agent communication language consists primitives called performatives allow agents communicate attitudes agents find agents suitable process requests 
research provides semantics kqml framework semantic description kqml languages agent communication 
avoiding commitments agent models inter agent interaction protocols 
kqml problem semantics example kqml message ask sender receiver language prolog ontology foo reply id content bar kqml terminology ask performative 
value content expression language case prolog kqml message represents content communication illocutionary act 
parameters keywords introduce values provide context interpretation content hold information facilitate processing message 
thing implementation kqml se meaning kqml interpreted compiled language offered hardware platform machine 
agents speak kqml sense primitives library communication acts reserved meaning 
application programmer expected provide code processes performatives agent language knowledge representation framework 
kqml semantics formally defined 
goal provide semantic description language way captures intuitions language expressed existing documentation making commitments specific agent models coordination protocols order ensure widest possible applicability language 
reason supplement kqml formal semantics 
lack semantics kqml source criticism kqml 
various implementations appeared agreement regarding exact meaning performatives framework defining meaning new performatives problems semantic approach addresses 
agents semantic definitions performatives order inferences resulting kqml communication primitives 
semantic approach propose uses expressions suggest minimum set preconditions postconditions govern performative conditions suggest final state successful performance speech act performative expressions describe relevant exchange agents states propositional attitudes belief knowledge desire

researchers years problem formally capturing notions desire intention 
various formalizations exist considered definitive
