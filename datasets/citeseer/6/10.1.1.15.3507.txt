ad hoc sensor networks section discuss data routed adhoc aggregation network 
understand solution properties radio communication need emphasized 
radio broadcast medium sensor hearing distance hear message irrespective intended recipient

messages specify recipient broadcast meaning available recipients allowing sensors ignore messages intended non broadcast messages received sensors range unintended recipients simply drop messages addressed 
brief primer wireless sensor communication show sensors route data 
technique adopt build routing tree 
appoint sensor root 
root point routing tree built aggregated data converge 
root typically sensor interfaces querying user rest network 
root broadcasts message asking sensors organize routing tree message specifies id level distance root zero 
sensor hears message assigns level level message plus current level equal level message 
chooses sender message parent route messages root 
sensors rebroadcasts routing message inserting ids levels 
routing message floods tree fashion node message nodes assigned level parent 
nodes hear multiple parents choose arbitrarily discuss approaches section multiple parents improve quality aggregates 
routing messages periodically broadcast root process topology discovery goes continuously 
constant topology maintenance relatively easy adapt network changes caused mobility certain nodes addition deletion sensors sensor simply looks history received routing messages chooses best parent ensuring routing cycles created decision 
approach possible efficiently route data root 
sensor wishes send message root sends message parent turn forwards message parent eventually reaching root 
approach doesn address point point routing purposes flooding aggregation requests routing replies tree root sufficient

injecting query computing aggregate consists phases propagation phase aggregate queries pushed sensor networks aggregation phase aggregate values propagated children parents 
basic approach propagation works just network discovery algorithm described leaf nodes nodes children discover leaves propagate singular aggregates parents 
sensor receives aggregate sensor user transmits begins listening 
children hear children re transmit children know leaf 
time interval heard children concludes leaf transmits current sensor value routing tree 
children assumes report time time computes value applied value values children forwards partial aggregate parent 
notice choosing short duration lead missed reports children proper value varies depending depth routing tree 
discuss possible solution problem section assume set long message time propagate leaves back numerically time send message time process aggregation request 
empirical studies suggest needs milliseconds 
time transmit byte message kbit radio ms nibble dc balanced number ones zeros costing extra bits 
plus overhead simple forward error correction means byte bits transmitted bytes bits sec ms 
computation time small significantly ms allocated hop account differences clock synchronization sensors random collision detection back sensors engage 
deep sensor network computing single aggregate take seconds

streaming aggregates sensor networks inherently unreliable individual radio transmission fail nodes move 
hard guarantee significant portion sensor network detached particular aggregate computation 
consider example happens sensor broadcasts child misses message garbled transmission 
hear rebroadcast assume children forward sensor value 
entire network excluded aggregation computation result probably incorrect 
subtree graph fail way impossible give guarantees accuracy result 
solution problem double check aggregates computing multiple times 
simplest way request aggregate computed multiple times root network observing common case value aggregate client reasonable guess true value 
problem technique requires retransmitting aggregate request network multiple times significant message overhead user wait entire aggregation interval additional result 
propose pipelined aggregate works follows 
scheme aggregates propagated network described 
pipelined approach time divided intervals duration interval sensor heard request aggregate transmits partial aggregate applying local reading values children reported previous interval 
interval root hears sensors radio hop away 
second hears aggregates sensors hops away 
order include sensors missed request aggregation sensor hears sensor reporting aggregate value assume reporting aggregate value 
addition tending include nodes excluded single pass aggregation pipelined solution number interesting properties aggregates propagated leaves new aggregate arrives seconds 
note value quite small time takes single sensor produce transmit sensor reading versus value simple multi round solution proposed roughly times larger

comparable non pipelined aggregate requires messages back edge 
note example initial message overhead additional aggregate arrives cost messages rate update time interval 
ful consider optimizations reduce overhead

sees sensor reporting aggregate assume aggregating 
technique beneficial improving number sensors participating aggregate substantially reduces number messages sent pipelined aggregation scheme 
nodes assume aggregation time hear aggregate reported sensor need explicitly tell children aggregation 
simply report value parents children hear 
children assume missed start request initiate aggregation locally 
simple example messages associated black arrows need sent 
reduces total messages required compute full aggregate network total savings 
course rounds aggregation messages sent parents children savings longer available 
snooping reduce number messages sent certain classes aggregates 
consider computing maximum group sensors sensor hears peer reporting maximum value greater local maximum elect send value assured affecting value final aggregate 
discuss variants technique detail section 
addition reducing number messages sent inherently broadcast nature radio offers communications redundancy improve reliability 
consider sensor parents sending aggregate value just parent send parents 
easy node discover multiple parents simply build list nodes heard step closer root 
course aggregates min max sending multiple parents results undesirable effect causing node counted multiple times 
solution send part aggregate parent rest

assuming independence message parents lost single loss dramatically effect computed value 
note probability data lost lower multiple parents versus suggesting may useful technique 
losses assured happening occasionally aggregating believe users prefer aggregates closer correct answer exactly right 
technique applies equally age aggregates aggregate linear combination number values 
rank aggregates failure independence valid assumption occur hidden node communication parent forwarding message 
count aggregating node count count count count count count non aggregating node mode median technique applied 
final technique increasing efficiency aggregates rephrasing aggregates hypotheses dramatically reduce number sensors required respond aggregate 

hypothesis testing techniques offer significant gains terms number messages transmitted robustness respect naive approaches techniques require input node network compute aggregate

pipelined computation aggregates required send message value greater minimum observed top levels intermediate nodes forward request aggregate send messages 
assume sensor values independent randomly distributed big assumption particular leaf mote transmit probability branching factor tree number sensors top levels quite low small values balanced tree half nodes bottommost level reduce total number messages sent factor 
aggregates accumulate total technique applicable 
third class statistical aggregates variance technique reduce number messages drastically

error bound approach top aggregates applied 
consider case average sensor error bound approximate answer need answer parent assume value approximate answer count accordingly scheme requires parents know children 
total computed average actual average error bound leaf sensors values close average required report 
obviously value scheme varies greatly distribution sensor values 
values uniformly distributed fraction leaves need report approximate size error bound 
values normally distributed larger percentage leaves report 
value scheme depends expected distribution values tolerance user inaccurate error bounds

section augment algorithms section support grouping 

grouping recall grouping computes aggregates partitions sensor readings 
basic technique grouping push set predicates specify group membership ask sensors choose group belong answers flow back update aggregate values appropriate groups 
group predicates appended requests aggregation 
sending predicates requires storage fit single message multiple messages sent 
group predicate specifies group id sensor attribute light temperature range sensor values define membership group 
groups assumed disjoint defined attribute typically attribute aggregated 
number groups large information groups fit ram sensor sensors pick group belong messages defining group predicates flow past discard information groups 
messages containing sensed values propagated just pipelined approach described 
sensor leaf simply tags sensor value group number 
sensor receives message child checks group number 
child group sensor combines values just 
different group stores value child group value forwarding interval 
child message arrives value group sensor updates appropriate aggregate 
interval sensor send value groups collected information previous interval combining information multiple groups single message long message size permits 
shows example computing query grouped temperature selects average light readings 
snapshot data assumed filled pipeline results bottom tree reached root 
recall sql queries contain having clause constrains set groups final query result applying filtration predicate group aggregate value 
pass predicate network partitions 
predicate sent network potentially reduce number messages sent example predicate attr information groups attr need transmitted tree predicate sent network 
predicates filtering average aggregates form max attr applied network evaluated final group aggregate value known 
number groups exceed available storage sensor way evict groups needed 
eviction victim selected forwarded sensor parent may choose hold group continue forward tree 
groups evicted user workstation top network may called combine partial groups form accurate aggregate value 
evicting partially computed groups known partial described database literature 
number possible policies choosing group evict 
believe policies incur significant storage overhead bits group undesirable reduce number groups stored increase number messages sent 
evicting groups low membership policy groups combined sensor readings groups benefit network aggregation 
evicting groups forces information current time interval higher level nodes tree 
standard pipelined scheme aggregates computed values previous time interval presents inconsistency
