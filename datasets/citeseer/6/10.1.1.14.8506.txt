preliminary studies people searching web crowston nilan liu cai observed genre document clues assessing document relevance value quality usefulness 
problems information access 
explain genre useful briefly review problem faced information access system 
information access system components users approach system contextually information needs store information documents databases mechanism connect needs information 
intermediary may person search algorithm browsing environment summarizer 
basic process matching users needs potentially useful information system complicated factors 
problems may occur due improper incomplete representations information 
information access system created documents texts represented way retrieved needed 
librarianship occupied century systematic approaches organizing representing information systems 
creating document genre bibliographic records call process cataloging organizing actual documents topics meaningful retrieval call classification providing access bibliographic databases call representation process indexing 
similar processes information representation web applications large stores information prepared eventual 
schemes adaptations traditional schemes yahoo com dublin core project gem metadata project educational materials www org 
comprise grass roots emergent sorts organization representations evolving classification ebay com amazon com liu 
increasingly popular approach relies solely full text documents 
problem may arise process matching users queries document representations may inadequate faulty 
effort part information scientists spent developing search strategies including various matching algorithms probabilistic techniques citation mapping natural language processing 
efforts struggle obstacles difficulties evaluating search results real environments problems scaling reliability representation bottleneck 
user side people need information 
users unable precisely specify need way humans articulate needs produces great variety expression 
problem appropriate representation users queries just question finding correct document genre representation absolute criteria 
information situated specific contexts need able represent information way match level physical description topic say terms matching information potential 
example consider person approaching system query want prepare dinner certain level see need concrete information form actual recipes 
interpret known item search recipes may satisfy need partially person may want know rituals meanings dinner just food 
information need may broader asked narrower specific 
know people ask expect get closely match really want requests compromised form 
see topic define information problem different users may require different solutions seemingly similar information problems 
user may require different information different times 
different needs arise situation context user determines topics requested strategies invoked searching evaluating output types resources considered relevant useful 
example methods learning mathematics topic may construed differently student parent classroom teacher different information situations 
know important understand situation user representation situation implementation system difficult problem 
efforts create user profiles universal situation grammars document genre suffer limitations scope specific domains lack extensibility flexibility 
think identification genre useful suggest enhancing document representations incorporating non topical characteristics documents signal purpose genre enrich document query representations way resonate truly information need user situated particular context 
genres characterized form purpose identifying genre document provides information document purpose fit user situation difficult assess 
instance university professor looking information computer database systems class teaches interested documents educational genres assignments class notes 
hand working research database area professor appreciate scholarly papers annotated biographies calls papers 
relevant documents searches quite different topic query keywords nearly 
explicit identification genre particularly important large digital collections search collections usually retrieves documents diversity genres worse genres undifferentiated obvious clues identity 
contrast non digital information seeking situations searcher generally idea sorts documents exist collection 
document genre clues physical form location increase chances document genre recognized 
example user searching library visually distinguish cds books encyclopedias newspapers 
similarly user searching database containing journal articles implicitly restricted search genre documents 
web search large diverse document collection usually retrieve documents relevant genres documents irrelevant genres low precision result retrieved documents conform search specifications regarding topical content document 
recognition genre implications automated methods representing documents automated summarization indexing 
size fits approach summarizing evaluating web documents regard form function 
example newspaper article summarized sentences document approach home page frequently asked questions document faq marcu 
medical information sought difference evaluation document retrieved newsletter personal homepage hospital patient information site 
librarians addressed notion genre library information systems mean imply information science addressed notion genre genre incorporated information representation schemes 
classification systems allow articulation genre document genre metadata standards including dublin core include field genre 
treatment genre limited defined 
understanding nature role document genre nascent kind information underdeveloped information retrieval systems 
furthermore clear extension genre designations originally designed physical collections export digital ones 
historically library information systems took genre granted collections contained limited array document types 
exceptions literary genres poetry publication types newspapers lively existence explicit document representation centuries 
aside primary facets access documents traditional systems descriptive components subject genre relatively rare 
descriptive access points derive traditional ways talking books book documents include title author place name publisher edition date series physical description terms pages size volumes information components called analytics 
subject analysis document captures document topic 
librarians information scientists recognized topical approach extremely important insufficient situations completely inappropriate 
document necessarily 
document nature document represents important useful aspect 
instance hand say book may history document genre structure beethoven fifth 
simply symphony form identifiable characteristics readily identifiable topic se attributed subtle non consensual processes interpretation 
notion document broader diverse environment web see concept subject stretch cover types information 
response need identify document form genre addition subject librarians created auxiliary tools form tables subdivisions existing topically classification subject heading schedules 
examples dewey decimal classification ddc dewey mitchell matthews new provides ways denote document form genre 
incorporate designation number 
cover 
part number designates country language final digits represent genre poetry drama fiction speeches humor document genre english poetry english drama english fiction english speeches english humor bulgarian poetry bulgarian drama bulgarian fiction bulgarian speeches bulgarian humor genre designations limited genres generally accepted western literary scholars necessarily job describing emerging culturally diverse hybrid genres 
way genre organization literary works 
interesting note public libraries formal system fiction arrange works author ad hoc tradition separating popular genres separate sections easy access mysteries science fiction 
technique ddc suffixes tables 
number topic established suffixes table added denote form genre 
example middle eastern cooking middle eastern cooking encyclopedia dictionaries encyclopedias middle eastern cooking magazine serial publication physical collections suffixes serve distinguish materials topic different publication formats 
notion form genre evolved physical distinctions publication document types grounded publishing practices realities 
interpretation documents remains implicit nature forms document genre practical implications collections 
instance dictionaries encyclopedias comprise non circulating collection magazines indexed stored differently books 
terms digital collections physical clues publication format largely absent suffixes provide useful indicators sorting filtering search results 
way subject indicated bibliographic record subject terms thesaurus list library congress subject headings 
comprises evolving list terms assign subject designations 
terms denote topics case 
proper names may subjects 
example document william shakespeare assigned shakespeare name subject william shakespeare 
modern cataloging practices abound confusions topic creative responsibility genre form documents inextricably fused 
confusion extends searchers realize searching genre problematic best 
distinction reserving subject headings topics subjects somewhat moderated addition subdivision 
kinds subdivisions subdivide subject time geographical location topical aspects 
example sweden th century teaching document genre subdivisions interest ones form subdivisions list 
type subdivision allows describe form literary genre 
list limited established types 
genres included literary warrant subject heading division developed existing hypothetical 
bibliography case studies dictionaries handbooks manuals periodicals poetry fact remains form genre rule important finding aid traditional systems 
instance final environmental impact statement green mountain finger lakes national forests land resource management plan assigned subject headings 
forest reserves vermont green mountain national forest forest reserves new york state finger lakes national forest forest management vermont green mountain national forest forest management new york state finger lakes national forest green mountain national forest vt finger lakes national forest retrieved national forests covered report topics forest reserves forest management 
possible retrieve environmental impact statement coincidence terms appear title come keyword search 
genres serve useful purpose templates interest right aside specific topic example document genre environmental impact statement subject heading assigned important aspect document 
libraries recognize genre form perceived topical additional access points accommodate 
instance rare book manuscript special collections library duke university lib duke edu genre headings html interesting set auxiliary tools searching collection 
genre form list genre terms searching topics 
sample terms list accounts business letters manuscripts official reports pattern books recipes seals tax returns immediately obvious helpful list studying communicative forms cultures represented collection
