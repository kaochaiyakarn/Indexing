envisioning homes believe majority movies television popular press articles mention life homes homes take care need 
homes fully automated smart rarely think everyday tasks 
nearly time home spent engaged leisure activities digital robotic agents taken mundane chores day day life 
researchers technologists cautious predictions survey ongoing shows bias creating home environments goal eliminating need think tasks controlling heating lighting going grocery store cleaning scheduling home appliances cooking 
field interviews medical professionals educators led group different direction 
simplification elimination everyday tasks home may direct conflict goals encouraging healthy resource conservation lifelong learning 
contrary medical professionals suggest developing systems require human effort ways keep people mentally physically engaged possible age goal 
instances may want automation allow people accomplish tasks longer perform disability primary vision computer technology ubiquitously proactively managing details home 
vision computer technology subtle way information people precisely time place need learn take better care learn conserve resources learn topics interest 
medical experts tell old adage lose applicable physical mental health age 
want pervasive technologies empower people information helps decisions want strip people sense control shown psychologically physically 
short designing pervasive computing environments take control environment home occupant previous systems done help home occupant learn take control

control versus empowerment example illustrate shift thinking consider example 
imagine goal create environment uses pervasive computing technology save energy automatically controlling heater vent air conditioning system 
assume environment embedded sensors infer context people people doing environmental conditions inside home 
assume home contains appliances windows blinds 
automated home way accomplish goal reducing resource consumption design home environment takes control environmental conditions 
home uses set optimization algorithms simultaneously maximize savings comfort automatically controlling systems windows blinds 
instance day temperature predicted shift warm cool home determine optimal cooling strategy shut ac automatically open set blinds windows create efficient cross breeze 
scenario relatively simple compared popular smart home visions 
practice executing scenario actual home setting difficult 
situations automatic system succeed optimizing temperature comfort fail doing right thing noisy occurring outside smoking outside window home pollen pollen count high raining outside quiet person reading hum air conditioner want blinds open throws glare computer screen 
system designer unable program common sense contingency plans possible contexts invariably system perform unexpected frustrating undesirable ways 
fundamental problem complexity algorithms consider making decisions transparent decisions home owner 
system predictable acquires expertise success system time raise occupant expectations system capable doing 
inevitably system violate occupant high expectations intelligence system shows making control decisions 
system complex occupant left feeling frustrated understand behavior 
keep opening windows clearly occupant wants needs closed 
common scenarios smart automatic control home suffer identical problems 
home uses subtle reminders consider alternative scenario 
vision home windows include tiny light embedded window frame led projected window pervasive computing display technology ibm display 
home embedded sensors optimization algorithms compute strategy cooling home opening particular set windows 
home proactively control home achieve computed optimal settings 
uses pervasive technologies teach home occupant non obtrusive way achieve optimal settings 
example light window subtly illuminate 
interrupt home occupant 
home notices person knows light indicates idea open window right home non informs occupant actions occupant take conserve energy money 
similar approach taken goal improve health introduce learning everyday life 
approach advantages proactive control information occupant react interrupting ongoing activity potentially irritating ways especially true information augmented physical environment projected light 
leaving occupant control making decisions allows home options partial information confusing occupant occupant naturally consider contexts home adjust actions accordingly 
algorithms suggestions degrade gracefully algorithms decisions typically 
lack control aspects life shown diminish health strategy empowers home occupant 
occupant ultimately decision open window 
task interpreting suggestion context rests occupant noisy outside occupant simply decide open window realizing time 
pervasive computing application exceptionally simple user interface 
system simple interface influence behavior 

controlled studies homes show small simple light ac unit lead reductions ac 
teaching home pervasive information display example light ac may lead behavior change way relies technology 
fortunately pervasive computing motivate behavior teach moment behavior undertaken 
systems automatically control decisions generally opportunity 
occupants system functioning perfectly 
computer system try occupant educational messages explain actions interrupting irritating occupant challenge 
system compute reasonable time information 
relatively simple help applications proven difficult microsoft paperclip attempts just time help ways requires occupant divert attention current task 
hand occupant unhappy control decision home user going state annoyance primarily interested home actions best time home explanatory information promote learning 
home leaves right amount control occupant avoids computational challenge indirectly inferring occupant intent order determine moment teach 
extraordinary power pervasive computing come play occupant decides take action opening window 
point behavior easily identified detecting specific event opening window 
occupant decision doing recommended task 
home safely infer directly sensor data occupant opening window receptive information helps determine 
occupant curious home making recommendation 
occupant moved physical location object presents opportunity teach overlaying digital information physical space 
scenario precisely moment system determines occupant decided take action information overlaid real world educate occupant create effective cross breeze 
occupant time study information possible feedback results learning 
example window opened information projected nearby wall estimates magnitude breeze created 
person may notice counter intuitively opening window result stronger cross breeze 
occupant task interrupted occupant completely information attentional disruption created 
immediately point action information removed 
potential impact behavior non intrusive just time learning group studying 
interested points time point decision point behavior point consequence 
computers educate people take control environment sensors automatically detect specific moments time 
particular example occupant occasionally follows recommendation home gradually learn efficiently control temperature environment sophisticated ways 
occupants understand reason lights appear windows cool outside setup cross breeze 
gradually learn create cross breeze geometry house prevalent wind direction window outlets maximize cooling home understanding open window outlets maximize air flow understanding long take cooling occur understanding best times places establish intake air knowing fans facilitate cross breeze cooling 
things people know instruct need guidance point behavior
