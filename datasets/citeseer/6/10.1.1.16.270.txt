introduces novel pattern called indirect association examines utility various application domains 
existing algorithms mining associations apriori discover itemsets support user de ned threshold 
itemsets support minimum support requirement ltered 
believe infrequent pair items useful items related indirectly set items 
propose algorithm deriving indirectly associated demonstrate potential application patterns retail textual stock market domains 
years considerable interest extracting association rules large databases 
conceptually association rule indicates presence set items transaction implies presence items transaction 
problem mining association rules decomposed subproblems discover itemsets having support user de ned threshold generate rules frequent itemsets 
formulation itemsets fail support threshold condition considered uninteresting 
believe infrequent itemsets may provide useful insight data 
consider pair items fa bg seldom occurs transaction 
items highly dependent presence itemset said indirectly associated 
potential applications indirect associations 
market basket data method perform competitive analysis 
example may represent products competing brands 
suppose marketers interested expanding current market share attracting customers direct marketing campaigns 
promoting customers campaign supported nsf aci contract

indirect association mediating itemset ective terms cost bene lift analysis selecting smaller target group buying behavior resemble customers 
indirect association provides approach characterize group identifying set items bought groups customers 
text domain indirect association corresponds synonyms antonyms words di erent contexts word 
example words coal data indirectly associated mining 
user queries word mining collection documents returned contains mixture mining contexts 
indirect association potentially identify explicitly di erent ways queried word appears corpus text documents 
similarly stock market data indirect association help identify di erent set events uencing movement stock price 
importance indirect relationship attributes dataset acknowledged authors 
direct attempts explicitly derive patterns 
example melamed observed indirectly associated words tend reduce accuracy automated document translation systems polluting lexicon translation tables 
das introduced notion external similarity measure attributes database relation 
essentially external similarity measure proximity attributes values columns called probe attributes 
notion probe attribute similar idea mediator indirect association 
role probe attribute minimal far determining similarity attributes 
hand mediator central concept indirect association 
furthermore probe attributes chosen domain knowledge constraints speci ed user mediators automatically derived observation data described section 
problem formulation fi 
denotes set binary literals called items set transactions ft ig 
upper case letters represent itemsets sets itemsets lower case letters individual items 
sup denotes support itemset de nition 
fa bg indirectly associated mediator set conditions hold 
sup support condition 
exists non empty set sup sup mediator support condition 
measure dependence dependence condition 
condition needed indirect association signi cant items rarely occur transaction 
sense characterize pair terms direct association 
alternative condition test independence items 
case independent negatively correlated tend low support values 
condition ectively consider slightly negatively correlated 
condition guarantee statistical signi cance mediator set 
particular market basket data support itemset justi es feasibility promoting items 
support nice downward closure property allows prune combinatorial search space problem 
condition ensures items highly dependent form mediator set 
years measures proposed represent degree dependence attributes dataset 
measure pearson linear correlation coecient 
binary variables shown certain range support values correlation coecient expressed terms interest factor support sup right hand side expression called measure dependence measure condition 
measure desirable takes account interestingness support aspects pattern 
general framework accommodate measures rule interest measure gini index shown equally capturing statistical correlation

experimental results demonstrate utility indirect associations experiments carried datasets application domains text retail stock market data 
table shows summary datasets thresholds chosen experiments 
reuters distribution newswire articles 
dataset contains collection nancial commodity news articles appeared reuters newswire 
articles categories preprocessed removing stopwords stemming word root form 
table shows indirectly associated stemmed words collections news articles 
indirect associations represent di erent contexts term may appear news collection 
example indirect association soviet worker refers separate news threads union corresponds news stories soviet union involves articles labor unions 
retail data retail data obtained courtesy expected indirect associations correspond pairs competing items table 
doing competitive analysis interested discovering surprising patterns 
pattern surprising items belonging competing product categories directly associated 
rst surprising relates products di erent sizes items size distinction 
type pattern useful determine products bundled promotions 
second involves products competing design logos ag versus drivers 
logo matching sheet pillow case surprising joint support low

indirect associations event segmentation determine set events causing price stock move 
example rst indirect association table relates ibm lsi mu 
ibm provides various customer solution information technology yellow involved transportation business 
mediator contains stocks semiconductor companies lsi logic micron technology 
pattern indicates events involving lsi mu partitioned disjoint sets involving ibm associated third set events related ibm 
summary results show indirect association provide meaningful insight data
