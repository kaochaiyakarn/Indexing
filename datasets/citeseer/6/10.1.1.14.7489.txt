authoritativeness critical feature fueled rapid growth web fact barrier publication extremely low voice 
unfortunately curse information retrieval results huge document collection wildly varying degrees credibility authority

shows results queries anchor text content result sets contained documents 
results indicate outlier query homogeneity anchor text result sets higher result sets obtained querying content 
improved homogeneity results returned anchor text suggests documents returned matches anchor text tend focused just meaning terms queried meaning common meaning 
reasons phenomenon brevity anchor text compared documents 
matching multi word query long document homogeneity result sets anchor content queries large result sets 
various words query may match different parts document 
parts may talk distantly related subjects words queries appears appear context 
document match concept represented query 
anchor text hand short multiple words query appear appear great proximity tend meaning query 
expect true titles mentioned section titles rich useful multi word queries 

statistical study nature anchor text real user queries large corpus corporate intranet documents 
significant evidence supports hypothesis anchor text resembles real world queries terms term distribution length 
anchor text typically ambiguous types texts resulting coherent focused result set queries anchor text features corpus 
addition providing better match titles content language people queries anchor text holds promise providing authoritative results queries 
studied nature titles documents corpus 
traditional text search engines titles useful feature document titles far useful anchor text 
titles typically longer individual anchor text pages especially highly relevant pages individual anchor texts pointing 
provides better indication summarization page different contexts different people afforded single title authored author 
believe study real user queries real corpora essential improvement average user experience hypertext search gained 
current typical search engine users hypertext authors far professional information retrieval experts typical users earlier search engines 
hope results similar results may follow lead better understanding different features hypertext corpus contribute performance search engines 
understanding ultimately lead better search engines apply appropriate search techniques depending query corpus characteristics
