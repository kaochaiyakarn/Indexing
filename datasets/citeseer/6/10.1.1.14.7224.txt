statistics selecting ranking merit se new seed words ranking words final output 
merit simply ratio times noun noun seed list total fre quency noun corpus 
statis tic favors low frequency nouns neces inclusion minimum occurrence cutoff 
stipulated word occur ing fewer times corpus considered algorithm 
cutoff effects reduces noise associated multitude low frequency words removes consideration fairly large num ber certainly valid category members 
ide ally reduce noise reducing number valid nouns 
statis tics allow inclusion rare 
note particularly important algorithm restricted rele vant occurrences specific type structure relatively common nouns occur corpus handful times context 
figures merit employ select produce final rank counts noun 
noun occurrences seed words 
noun occurrences word select new seed words take ratio count count noun question 
similar merit tends promote low frequency nouns 
final ranking chose log likelihood statistic outlined dunning occurrence counts nouns see dunning details 
statis tic essentially measures surprising pattern occurrence distri butions completely random 
instance suppose words occur times occur times word corpus 
surprising completely random distributions occurred twice occurred 
simple probability cap ture fact 
rationale different statistics task suited par ticular role particularly suited 
mentioned simple ratio ill suited dealing quent occurrences 
poor candidate ranking final output list includes words occurrence corpus 
log likelihood statistic poorly suited selecting new seed words iterative algorithm sort promotes high frequency nouns overly ence selections iterations selected seed words
