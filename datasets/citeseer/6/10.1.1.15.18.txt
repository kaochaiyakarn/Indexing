text segment coherent scene words segment linked lexical cohesion relations 
lcp records mutual similarity words sequence text 
similarity words represents cohesiveness computed semantic network

lcp may provide valuable formation resolving anaphora ellipsis

recognizing structure text essential task text understanding especially resolving anaphora ellipsis

lcp shown large hills valleys meaningless noise 
graph complicated easily valley considered segment boundary 
shape window defines weight words pattern production lcp smooth 
experiments win dow shapes triangle window shows hanning window best clarifying macroscopic features lcp 
width window effect macroscopic features lcp especially separability segments

solid bars represent histogram segment boundaries reported subjects read text paragraph structure 
clear valleys lcp cor respond dominant segment bound aries 
example clear valley exactly corresponds dominant segment boundary paragraph boundary shown dotted line 
note lcp detect segment changing text regardless paragraph structure 
example paragraph boundary valley lcp segment boundary segment boundary approximately valley lcp paragraph boundary 
valleys lcp exactly correspond segment boundaries 
example valley near disagree segment boundary

proposed lcp indicator seg ment changing concentrates lexical cohesion text segment 
experiment proved lcp closely correlate seg ment boundaries captured human ments lexical cohesion plays main role forming sequence words segments 
text segmentation described provides basic information text understanding resolving anaphora ellipsis segment boundaries provide valuable re determination referents
