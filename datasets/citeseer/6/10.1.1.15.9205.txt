shared office environments headphones preferred speakers general headphones produce better quality speakers 
shared whiteboard video decoding provided wb ivs require specialist hardware 
remote participant wants transmit video video card needed sun board parallax card 
reasonably powerful workstation required decode multiple video streams encode video 
particular concern speaker gives seminar workstation conference remote seminars proc 
inet sasse room video codec van jacobson delivered seminar workstation 
ii participating conference rooms remote seminars participants remote conference rooms ucl sics kth university oslo gmd darmstadt audiences ranging participants 
conference rooms allow participants suitable workstations participate 
participants prefer conference room sit workstation conference room environment creates seminar atmosphere 
conference room needs facilities audio 
optimum types placement microphones needs attention experienced expert 
argue professional audio equipment wasted bit sample audio resolution transmission able reproduce quality works way bad quality input audio particular mismatched dynamic levels noise cause audio coding bit resolution 
mice partners invested effort finding adequate audio configurations 
video whiteboard visible conference room audience large monitor facility project workstation screen needed 
mice partners implemented different facilities conference rooms back projected screens video projectors light pens boards front projected overhead projector lcd displays tv monitors local remote video 
unfortunately today simply inexpensive solutions large quality high resolution high contrast mouse able screen projection facilities 
discovered solutions involving expensive hardware problems see section iii 
cameras sending video may expensive type provided low noise level noise tend confuse inter frame compression schemes 
fixed cameras pointing speaker back room showing audience front angle works nicely 
cameras transmitted local operator easily switch appropriate

iii speaker view core seminars minute presentation speakers 
speakers academics working computing related subject 
quite academics visiting ucl sics kth reach audience european countries multicast 
seminar van jacobson multicast office lawrence berkeley labs distributed european sites ucl 
new skills required give lecture remote audience 
instruction practise required sound check prior seminar adjust audio levels necessary 
coping lack feedback disturbing 
due insufficient bandwidth keep video rates remote sites low typically frames second low resolution switched network load caused large packet loss 
presence audience important speaker specially trained television 
seminars conducted local audience proved difficult speakers know look felt distracting suspicion talking void 
remote comments whiteboard presence video images audiences proved ways reassuring speaker video quality low 
speaker slides displayed wb workstation screen front remote seminars proc 
inet sasse projected large wall screen 
pointing drawing slides done mouse keyboard workstation light pen projected image available 
light pen speaker may point projected wall image get help local support person put markers shared whiteboard 
advantage somewhat awkward procedure speaker may freely address local audience disappearing workstation screen lose focus audience 
iii audiences view seminar series run various types remote audiences different sites individual users desktop workstations remote audiences people conference rooms local seminar audience transmitting conference room 
greatest advantages multicast 
added listener consumes little extra network resources 
means listening seminar desktop system provides inexpensive easy access remote events 
headphones may required desktop participants shared office environments 
participants audio quality important biggest problem packet loss due network congestion 
observed loss impossible understand speaker particularly language listener native language 
distributed whiteboard display slides helps great deal understanding chopped sound resulting packet loss irritating enthusiastic participants tire lose interest conditions 
remote participants reported video speaker provides higher sense presence seminar audio conference 
audio quality deteriorates due network congestion stopping video transmission relieve congestion improve audio preferred 
conference rooms microphone input fed local speakers risk sound audio feedback gain microphones may adjusted needed 
great risk received audio going microphones causing everybody site doing get echoes 
prevented echo mechanism vat microphone transmission muted incoming audio net vice versa 
local conference room audience participating normal seminar differences significant 
speaker addressing people room remote audiences requires thought speaker point view 
greatest procedural difference concerns interrupt speaker questions 
transmitted video image include local audience may hard remote audience follow happening 
experience best solution locally show remote audience image transmitted 
increase feeling presence cause normal seminar behaviour 
participants experiencing tools time distracted activity workstation screen volume indicator vat 
introduced second screens conference rooms moderator support staff see audio tool shown local audience talk 
leaves distraction due activity moderator support person adjust piece equipment type response query comment remote side 
local conference rooms conflict lighting 
whiteboard show slides speaker draw usually projected screen image current technologies bright 
careful attention testing required get lighting required video cameras produce image speaker close projected whiteboard losing contrast projected image 
iii moderators support staff organisers easily understand professional video recording teams need staff lot things take care produce transmission seminar especially unexpected events happen course prototype environment mice 
possible experienced speaker run seminar special technician 
far support needed speaker new environment support needed 
remote receiving sites support needs provide feedback sending site technician concerning audio video quality packet loss currently working monitoring management tools provide moderator transmitting site information

easily shows currently difficult imagine conferencing technology walk environment speakers participants technical support 
technician probably needed transmitting site speaker inexperienced seminar tools 
clear technician suffice produce reasonable quality transmission professional video producer probably agree 
establish kind relaxed communication paradigm new media case electronic mail 
language style level formality electronic letter quite efficient comfortable traditional letter fax message 
reasons hope replicated networked personal multimedia communication

greatest single problem encountered congestion internet causing unacceptable audio quality due packet loss 
currently packet loss bad turn audio quality unusable turn entire seminar video transmission sensitive packet loss 
unfortunately compression techniques yielding compression degrades reception quality higher degree case network data loss 
seminar situation low video quality considerably disturbing audience bad audio 
limited bandwidth risk network congestion calls tools concentrates bandwidth usage critical media
