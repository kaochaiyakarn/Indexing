melody representation mentioned melody representation capture melody information suit people humming habits 
considering principle proposed triplet melody representation 
melody contour 
uses sequences repeat difficult impossible distinguish repeated note continuous humming correctly 
repeated notes pitch discriminate time domain energy information 
continuously 
may obvious energy break note repeated 
impossible extract information humming 
meet repeated note detect database humming just merge note 
second easier human discriminate reproduce relative pitch variations absolute pitch perception 
select pitch interval absolute pitch component melody 
rhythm important melody information obviously 
melody representation note duration feature 
note repeated duration added previous 
components represent melody information 
triplet pitch contour pitch interval duration ud string represent pitch contour indicates note higher lower previous respectively 
pitch interval stands amplitude note variation difference frequencies consecutive notes 
duration represents long note played 
represents rhythm 
feature file song composed series triplets 
example segment scores song illustrated 
note 
part score song triplet melody representation segment represented note represented star match process 

midi database processing construct music database directly web collected midi files 
addition melody information midi file contains information noise matching process decrease retrieval performance drastically 
general possible ways processing multi track midi files 
midi file denotes melody track select main melody track omit tracks 

keep tracks midi file 

combine tracks 
meet simultaneous notes chord select highest pitch note way 
method best way human main melody song 
unfortunately midi file denotes track melody track 
difficult select melody track midi file automatically 
method keeps tracks performance decrease tracks negative influence retrieval 
method combines tracks 
experimented approach combining tracks playing back 
melody original music changed little way 
uncomfortable retrieval 
order overcome shortcomings proposed heuristic method compromising methods 
midi file denotes melody track select discard tracks 
information melody track possible metadata exclude impossible tracks 
example channel usually fixed excluded 
length track short discarded 
impossible discard non melody tracks process removes noise possible 
candidate track obtained select highest note exists chord track 
convert track triplet melody representation store feature files 

query processing papers discuss process humming signal 
really important influence system performance 
extract melody humming correctly desired song retrieved accurately 
illustrates query processing algorithm detail 
algorithm energy zero crossing rate discriminate silence noise useful humming signal pitch detection module obtain false pitch value segments 
removing false pitches median filter smooth pitch contour remove atypical points 
adaptive method get melody representation 
divided steps 
energy contour divide humming segments 
transition segment represents note change 
rule applied process energy drops low level goes rapidly long silence new note may 
fact method coarse misses note changes 
song usually continuously obvious energy drop exists notes change 
result process 
different methods intra inter segment processing 
detected note changes segment intra segment pitch contour 
simple clustering merging pitch processed 
exists large pitch variance larger threshold th note change occurs 
time information pitch interval segment obtained 
note repeated segment detected 
repeat information extracted 
reason information melody representation 
extract ud information pitch interval inter segments different threshold th step 
generally set th th human humming habit 
people keep pitch relativity pause 
integrating steps get melody representation human vocal input 
energy detection adaptive note segmentation segment info 
humming query zero crossing rate detection inter intra segment processing different threshold pitch detection pitch contour removing silence noise median filter melody representation pitch contour removing atypical point 
query processing algorithm 
hierarchical matching works distance area metrics matching algorithm usually time consuming 
absolute value rhythm pitch interval humming different original song scales time frequency need adjusted step step compute similarity score 
works pitch contour match process fast accuracy low 
promising way match humming database fast accurate 
hierarchical matching method proposed satisfy request algorithm illustrated 
algorithm divided steps 
ud contour alignment 
approximate string matching dynamic programming align ud contours query candidate music segments 
distance larger threshold discard unqualified piece 
matched path pairs recorded processing 
count deletion insertion substitution 

matched path compute similarity pitch interval rhythm pairs 
suppose aligned pitch interval list qi di aligned rhythm array xi yi length aligned sequences 
similarity measured equations 
rank qi di qi di xi yi rank max yi weight rank rank pitch interval similarity rhythm similarity respectively averages qi di qi di 
combine result alignment similarities final rank obtained rank rank rank mis weight 
experiment observed people hum pitch variations correctly rhythm 
means errors involve rhythm pitch interval 
give larger weight rank
