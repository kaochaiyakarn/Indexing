remaining text terms standard ip source standard ip receiver refer traditional ip multicast source receiver term ad hoc sender ad hoc receiver refer pure ad hoc nodes 
mmarp uses igmp protocol means interoperate access network standard ip nodes 
interoperation access routers performed multicast internet gateways ad hoc nodes situated just hop away fixed network 
responsible sending igmp reports access routers notify group memberships ad hoc network extension 
approach shields mmarp operation protocols performing intra domain interdomain multicast routing ip network 
creation maintenance distribution mesh mmarp uses hybrid approach construct multicast distribution mesh 
multicast routes nodes ad hoc extension established demand multicast routes multicast sources fixed network established proactively 
mesh distribution structure offers protection mobility nodes 
reactive part protocol consists request reply phase 
ad hoc node new data send broadcasts mmarp source message flooded entire ad hoc network serves backward learning mechanism 
proactive part protocol periodic advertisement default multicast gateways fixed network 
node realises mig receives igmp queries access routers 
periodically broadcast mmarp dfl route message flooded ad hoc network 
ad hoc nodes receiving messages able select preferred mig metric hops 
messages arrives receiver standard ip receiver broadcasts mmarp join message including ip address previous hop learnt request phase reach sources ad hoc extension preferred mig reach internet 
ad hoc node detects ip address mmarp join message recognises path source destination 
activates mf flag multicast forwarder flag rebroadcasts mmarp join message containing previously learnt previous hop source 
addition mig receives mmarp join message addressed sends igmp report multicast router access network ip multicast data sources fixed network reach destinations ad hoc network extension 
process ends creating shortest multicast tree source destinations 
different sources group combination different trees form multicast distribution mesh

mmarp state diagram data forwarding reliability loop avoidance data forwarding straightforward data packet addressed group arrives node mf flag group active checks message duplicate case retransmits packet 
case packet silently dropped 
addition overcome link breakages creation distribution mesh local repairing mechanism 
node unable deliver mmarp join message hop retries broadcasts mmarp nack message hop neighbours 
reception message neighbours route reach hop 
know alternate path repeat process path 
recovery process offer optimal routes offers quick recovery topology refresh 
loop avoidance guaranteed means inclusion unique identifier sequence number packet allows intermediate nodes discard duplicate packets create loop free routes 
improving backward compatibility support order compatible standard ip multicast model mmarp nodes neighbourhood standard ip node send mmarp source mmarp join messages behalf standard ip node 
means messages generated standard ip nodes may received neighbours processed independently creating unnecessary paths 
mmarp protocol designed avoid unnecessary generation messages 
includes field allows identification node triggered sending control message allows ad hoc nodes identify mmarp packets triggered specific standard ip node independently ad hoc neighbour generated
