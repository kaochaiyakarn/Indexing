web usage mining benefits including semantics mining process simple reason application expert user mining results interested events application domain particular user behavior data available web server logs technically oriented sequences requests central aim map requests meaningful units application events 
application events defined respect application domain site non trivial task amounts detailed formalization site business model 
example relevant business events include product views product click throughs user shows specific interest specific product requesting detailed www daml org www org sw www cs man ac uk horrocks fact information beach hotel listing prices various seasons 
related events product category beach hotel category hotels click banner ad 
product oriented events include shopping cart changes product purchases bids 
web server logs generally contain information event marked user request specific web page system generating page acknowledge successful completion transaction 
example consider tourism web site allows visitors search hotels different criteria look detailed descriptions hotels reservations 
web site hotel room reservation event may identified recorded delivery page reserve php user hotel people arrive may depart may generated user chose room persons beach hotel typed arrival departure dates desired stay 
information log contains sufficient depend technical set site purposes analysis 
aspects application events need reconstructed semantics 
sections show requested web page content second request specific service concerning content third usually part larger sequence events 
refer atomic application events third complex application event 
atomic application events content requested web page usually product object described page 
example search hotel html facilities tennis may page hotels specifically listing hotels special attention detailed indication sports facilities 
describe content way urls generally mapped concepts 
concepts usually organized taxonomies called concept hierarchies see definition section 
example tennis court facility 
introducing relations note facility belongs accommodation 
see fig 

atomic application events service requested web page reflects purposeful user activity request specific service 
example search hotel html facilities tennis generated user initiated search hotel facilities desired value 
way tourism example inspired project www de index en html provides ontology access tourism web pages mecklenburg www de region north eastern germany 
family hotel accommodation hotel legend concepts relations belongs youth hotel root facility food provider tennis court sports facility concept hierarchy taxonomy indicates relation signature relation hierarchy restaurant fast food indian italian german vegetarian regular
