tunneling routing procedures handoff internet may undergo problems mt traveling satellite environment 
users able negotiate bandwidth transmission quality delay service profile user service offerings user service provider 
user able choose services available region menu subscription profile 
generation services continuous seamless user ship vehicle plane 
expected variety services available rural areas dense urban areas 
services requiring higher transmission rates accessible high density areas business offices lower speed services accessible environments 
services provided continuous availability global basis regardless user roaming situation geographic location access limits visited network 
standardization considering proposed unification great need common management capabilities order handle network level mobility requirements 
standardization slowest area progress 
general agreement japan europe united states countries global standards best interests difficulties exist achieving necessary cooperation regional international bodies 
network service provider level may choose specialize operations order serve customers 
order obtain projected level global communication entities able coexist cooperate infrastructure 
previous generations generation wireless systems gradually implemented current infrastructures 
result scenarios mobile ip interworking atm watm plmn terrestrial networks interworking satellite networks traffic congestion relief 
research continues explore options integrating network services boundaries prohibit global freedom wireless communication continue disappear
