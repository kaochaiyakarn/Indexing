metadata tagging enables organizations describe index search resources essential reusing 
elearning community metadata standards emerging describe elearning resources ieee lom ltsc ieee org doc wg lom html ariadne ariadne unil ch metadata ims www org metadata html 
meta models define learning materials described interoperable way 
metadata elements necessary describe resource classified categories offering distinct view resource
