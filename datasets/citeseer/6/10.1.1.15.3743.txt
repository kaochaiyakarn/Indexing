incentive scheme outlined selective denial requests 
ways implement incentives

kazaa participation level operates similar principle peer requests file peer smaller participation level pushed back queue 
implementing incentives download level restrict search capabilities peer 
basic idea reduce number peers queries propagated 
gnutella peer forwards query neighbors time live ttl field
