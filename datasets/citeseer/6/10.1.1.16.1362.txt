efficient system interaction user tailor behavior user reaction 
doing system manage contextual information interaction 
successive versions piece software take account users feedbacks show importance user centered approach 
may please part users please part 
example macintosh operating system provides support levels user wants open item folder containing documents open application folder containing applications opened folder containing servers visited 
improvement implies assumptions way users

continuous aspect context mccarthy says knowledge contexts needs process permitting piece knowledge contexts general context cover initial contexts 
conversely suggest concept context preferably understood process contextualization 
information process contextualizing data contextualization process involves immediate data history data preceded word text utterance visual information case sign knowledge possessed recipient mental models general knowledge 
context may typically viewed environment communication enables intended meaning ascribed recipient data
