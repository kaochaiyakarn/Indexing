rationale design issue centralized broker design motivated growing demand intelligent mobile computing devices increasing concern privacy security issues sharing user information open dynamic environment :10.1.1.13.6305:10.1.1.42.3806
past years computation speed storage capacity mobile devices significantly increased trend expected continue foreseeable 
due size form factor constraints today mobile devices lack necessary resources facilities context aware comparison stationary counterparts battery power persistent storage sensor access 
addition resource issues growing popularity wireless networks wi fi bluetooth irda raises great concerns information security personal privacy 
example network connectivity information associated user device give information user location activities user participates people user associated :10.1.1.42.3806
believe centralized context broker operates stationary computer intelligent space overcome resource issues mobile devices address privacy security concerns 
design burdens acquiring reasoning context information shifted away resource limited mobile devices resource rich server entity complications establishing monitoring enforcing security trust privacy polices simplified presence centralized manager 
existence context broker bring advantages centralized design create bottle neck situation distributed system hindering system performance
