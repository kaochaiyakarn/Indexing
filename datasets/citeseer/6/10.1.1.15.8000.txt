data mining analysis detecting useful interactions combinations data selectors numeric variable 
characterize impact rules follows 
training set nite set records record element apply boolean predicates called conditions associated numeric value called target 
impact rule consists conjunction conditions called antecedent statistics called consequent describing impact target selecting training set records satisfy antecedent 
impact rule analysis may seek nite number impact rules individually optimize function quality usually rule statistics 
alternatively proposed aumann lindell may seek impact rules satisfy speci ed constraints
