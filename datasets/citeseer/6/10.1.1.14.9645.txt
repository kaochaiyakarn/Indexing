motivation web graph conventional information retrieval focuses primarily information provided text web documents web provides additional information way different documents connected hyperlinks 
web may viewed directed graph nodes documents edges hyperlinks 
authors tried analyze properties graph 
comprehensive study due broder 

data altavista crawl may urls links stored underlying graph structure connectivity server bharat implements efficient document indexing technique allows fast access outgoing incoming hyperlinks page 
entire graph fitted gb storage breadth search reached nodes took minutes 
main result analysis structure web graph looks giant bow tie strongly connected core component scc pages middle components pages sides containing pages scc reached set containing pages reached scc set 
addition tubes allow reach set set passing scc lead set set connecting components 
smaller components reached point structure 
broder sketch diagram structure somewhat deceptive prominent role scc sets size structures similar shape somewhat smaller size tubes may contain strongly connected components differ scc size 
main result disjoint components 
fact probability path randomly selected pages exists 
analysis structure broder 
estimated diameter maximum lengths shortest paths nodes scc larger diameter entire graph larger average length path 
course cases path pages exists 
results correct earlier estimates obtained albert 
estimated average length 
probabilistic argument estimates degrees degrees ignoring possibility disjoint components 
albert 
base analysis observation degrees number incoming links degrees number outgoing links follow power law distribution estimated values degrees degrees respectively 
note power law distributions imply higher probability encountering documents large degrees case random networks random graphs 
power law results confirmed broder 
observed power law sizes strongly connected components web graph 
faloutsos 
observed zipf distribution outdegree nodes rank degree sorted list degree values 
similarly levene 
observed zipf distribution model behavior web surfers 
interesting property size web 
lawrence giles suggest estimate size web overlap different search engines return identical queries 
method assumption probability page indexed search engine independent probability page indexed search engine case percentage pages result set query search engine indexed search engine estimate percentage pages indexed obviously independence assumption argument hold practice estimated percentage larger real percentage obtained estimates web size lower bounds 
lawrence giles results queries estimate largest search engine indexes third indexable web portion web accessible crawlers hidden query interfaces 
similar arguments bharat broder estimate relative size search engines 
importance predecessor pages try motivate information predecessor pages pages hyperlink pointing target page may contain particularly useful information classifying page redundancy quite page pointing single page web 
ability combine multiple independent sources information improve classification accuracy witnessed success ensemble techniques areas machine learning dietterich 
independent encoding set predecessor pages typically originates different authors provided information sensitive vocabulary particular author 
sparse non existing text web pages contain limited amount text 
fact pages contain images machine readable text 
looking predecessor pages increases chances encountering informative text page classify 
irrelevant misleading text pages contain irrelevant text 
cases pages designed deliberately contain misleading information 
example pages try include lot keywords comments invisible parts text order increase breadth indexing word search engines 
fact predecessor pages typically authored different independent sources may provide relevant information improve focus 
foreign language text english predominant language web 
documents languages occur non negligible numbers 
text page written foreign language may incoming links pages written english 
cases allows english speaker text classifier english vocabulary infer contents page 
summary text predecessor pages may provide richer vocabulary independent assessment contents page multiple authors redundancy classification focus important aspects simple mechanism dealing pages sparse text text text different languages 
making graph structure retrieval importance information contained hyperlinks pointing page recognized early 
anchor texts texts hyperlinks html document predecessor pages indexed world wide web worm search engines web crawlers mcbryan 
spertus suggested taxonomy different types hyper links web discusses links exploited various information retrieval tasks web 
main break realization popularity importance page extent correlated number incoming links information sorting query results search engine 
degree poor measure importance pages frequently pointed connected contents referring page think numerous best viewed hyperlinks point browser home pages 
sophisticated measures needed 
kleinberg realized types pages relevant query authorities pages contain useful information query topic hubs contain pointers information sources 
obviously types pages typically connected hubs contain pointers authorities authorities pointed hubs 
kleinberg suggested practical relationship associating page hub score authority score computed iteratively example author encountered page austrian ski contained complete list austrian ski comments apparently goal retrieved somebody looks information competitors fact page author 
recognizing page ski information may helpful 
hand author came page included entire dictionary common words english language invisible text 
hi ai ai hi denotes hyperlink page page computation conducted called focussed subgraph web obtained enhancing search result conventional query bounded subset result predecessor successor pages bounded subset 
hub authority scores uniformly normalized sum iteration 
kleinberg able prove algorithm called hits converge practical experience shows typically iterations chakrabarti 
hits identifying relevant documents topics web catalogues chakrabarti bharat henzinger implementing related pages functionality dean henzinger 
main drawback hits algorithm hubs authority score computed iteratively query result meet real time constraints line search engine 
implementation similar idea google search engine resulted major break search engine technology 
brin page suggested probability page visited random surfer web key factor ranking search results 
approximated probability called pagerank computed iteratively ri ri term sum models behavior surfer gets bored probability typically set jumps randomly selected page entire set pages 
second term uniformly distributes current page rank page successor pages 
page receives high page rank linked pages turn high page rank successor pages 
main advantage page rank hubs authority scores computed line precomputed pages index search engine 
clever secret integration information typically search engines number matching query terms location matches proximity matches promoted google student project main player search engine technology 
classification surprisingly research looked potential hyperlinks additional information source hypertext categorization tasks 
authors addressed problem way merging parts text predecessor pages text page classify keeping separate feature set predecessor pages 
example chakrabarti 
evaluated variants simply appends text neighboring predecessor successor pages text target page uses different sets features target page concatenation neighboring pages 
results negative domains approaches performed worse conventional technique uses features target document 
results chakrabarti 
concluded text neighbors noisy help classification proposed different technique included predictions class labels neighboring pages model 
labels neighbors known priori implementation approach requires iterative technique assigning labels changing class page may potentially change class assignments neighboring pages 
authors implemented relaxation labeling technique showed improves performance standard text approach ignores hyperlink structure 
utility classes predictions neighboring pages confirmed results oh

variant foil quinlan learn classification rules incorporate features neighboring pages 
algorithm uses deterministic version relational path finding richards mooney overcomes foil restriction determinate literals quinlan construct chains link predicates allow learner access words page predicate type word page word 
example conjunction link word word means exists predecessor page contains word word 
slattery mitchell improve basic foil learning algorithm integrating ideas originating hits algorithm computing hub authority scores pages craven slattery combine favorably naive bayes classifier 
core features pages linked link predicate quite similar approach evaluated chakrabarti 
words neighboring documents added separate feature set cases learner access features neighboring documents 
main difference lies fact relational representation learner may control depth chains link predicates may incorporate features pages clicks apart 
practical point view main difference lies types learning algorithms approaches inductive logic programming typically relies rule learning algorithms classify pages hard classification rules predict class looking selected features chakrabarti 
learning algorithms take available features account naive bayes classifier

discuss approaches relate taxonomy possible regularities may neighborhood target page empirically compare different conditions 
classification hyperlink ensembles mentioned approaches suffer short features predecessor pages kept separately failed attempt chakrabarti 
merges entire text predecessor pages single pot 
redundancy provided multiple predecessors exploited ilp approaches principle keep features separately restricted existential variables rules formulate rules type exists predecessor page properties 
entire text predecessor page relevant page predecessor pages may belong different class 
entire text outgoing hyperlink represented way 
hand simply focussing anchor text narrow 
pages relevant meta information solution proposed chakrabarti 
assumes predecessor page page part classification problem assigned meaningful category 
need case 
rnkranz introduced hyperlink ensembles classification hypertext pages address mentioned problems 
idea quite simple training classifier classifies pages words appear text propose train classifier classifies hyperlinks class pages point words occur neighborhood link simplest case anchor text link 
consequently page assigned multiple predictions class membership incoming hyperlink 
individual predictions combined final prediction voting procedure 
technique member family ensemble learning methods dietterich 
preliminary empirical evaluation webkb domain task recognize typical entities computer science departments faculty student course project pages craven hyperlink ensembles outperformed conventional full text classifier 
studied effect different voting schemes importantly different feature representations 
addition anchor text investigated headings preceding current paragraph text current paragraph linguistic phrases occur current paragraph 
combination anchor text heading features turned important addition paragraph text phrasal features lead minor improvements 
main problem phrasal features phrasal features specific general low recall cf
