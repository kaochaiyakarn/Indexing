swaminathan sato proposed making relevant controls screen sticky 
alternative way launching applications today operating systems offer menus containing lists available application documents

furthermore invoking content menu may require hitting qualifier key problematic touch systems 
design algorithms section take detailed look design algorithms drag pop pick 
selecting candidates order reduce clutter drag pop creates tip icons subset icons screen 
drag pop candidate selection algorithm initialized entire set icons screen successively eliminates candidates rules 
icons incompatible type eliminated 
user drags text file icon text processor create tip icon recycle bin icon create tip icon icon text file dragging text files usually associated behavior 
drag pick bypasses selection step order allow users activate type icon 
second icons located cursor location tip icons cluster appear see section eliminated 
rule avoids creating tip icons move away cursor 
third icons located certain angle initial drag direction target sector considered 
initial drag direction determined moment user drags icon threshold default pixels 
preliminary testing smartboard got results time users sector sizes degrees 
sector size reduced sector sizes degrees users gained experience 
forth number qualifying icons hard limit drag pop eliminates tip icon candidates hard limit met 
icons removed order starting outside target sector moving inwards 
rule assures scalability drag pop densely populated displays requires drag pop users working densely populated screens aim precisely 
typically hard limits 
computing tip icon layout tip icon candidates selected pop determines screen place tip icons 
order avoid interference tip icons location tip icons computed centralized fashion 
drag pop prototype uses algorithm illustrated snap icons grid store dimensional array array element representing cell grid 
icons fall cell refine grid 
shrink icon layout eliminating array columns rows contain icons 
translate icon positions back space mapping array regular grid 
default output grid chosen slightly tighter input grid gives extra compression 
drag pop computes tip icon layouts snapping icons grid removing empty rows columns 
chose algorithm preserves alignment proximity spatial arrangement icons allows users spatial memory identifying desired target tip icon cluster 
especially useful tip icons look alike folder cluster folders 
order help users distinguish local icon clusters surrounding icons easily algorithm may adjusted shrink empty rows columns layout computation removing entirely 
tip icon layout computed drag pop positions screen center layout bounding box located direct extension user current mouse motion 
distance tip icon cluster user current cursor position configurable 
inexperienced users got best results distances pixels shorter distances users overshoot cluster 
experienced users able reduce distance values pixels allowed users operate drag pop effort menu fashion 
order reduce visual interference tip icons icons desktop drag pop diminishes desktop icons tip icons visible 
rubber band tip icon cluster displayed users need re identify targets tip icon cluster order able successfully acquire 
implementation drag pop created tip icons top bases slow animation shneiderman move tip icons final location 
approach allowed users locate final position desired tip icon visually tracking way basis final position required users wait animation complete acquire moving target 
chose abandon animation immediately display tip icons final destinations 
lieu animation provided tip icons rubber bands 
design prototype rubber band shown 
performance reasons prototype shown screenshots uses rubber bands lower level graphical detail tape lines color scheme corresponding icon 
purpose rubber band offer functionality animation problems alluded 
rubber band decorated respective icon texture thought having created photograph tip icon animation long shutter speed called motion blur kaufman 
animation rubber band allows users trace path base tip icon 
users pace customized texturing rubber band allows users start tracing base 
rubber band provided narrow section suggesting rubber band elastic 
design chosen help users understand tip icons retracted bases disappear interaction 
feature may help users find way tip icon faster provides users visual cue far away tip icon located 
thick rubber band section implies tip icon base close thin rubber band section indicates target away 
compress compress skew skew stretch stretch overlay motion blur textures rubber bands connect tip icons bases overlaying skewed copies icon 
aborting drag pop interactions soon tip icons rubber bands shown screen drag pop waits user acquire tip icons complete ongoing drag pop drag pick interaction 
cases users want abort interaction acquiring tip icon 
case user dragged mouse wrong angle desired target icon pop 
case user may drop icon try complete interaction regular drag drop interaction dropping icon target icon base 
case occurs user intending perform regular mouse drag operation example rearrange icons desktop capture set icons lasso operation 
cases drag pop allows users terminate tip icons onthe fly complete interaction pop pick 
abort users move mouse cursor away tip icon cluster keeping mouse depressed 
done overshooting cluster changing mouse direction 
particular allows users access underlying drag drop lasso select functionality introducing simple zigzag gesture cursor path 
zigzag contains motion segment moving away tip icons terminating tip icons soon appear 
algorithm tip icon cluster kept alive long rules successful 
rule checks mouse cursor moved closer center icons tip icon cluster 
rule sure cluster disappear users approach targets 
second rule checks cursor direct vicinity icon 
rule provides tolerance users overshooting tip icon acquiring 
third rule keeps cluster alive cursor stationary moving backwards slowly frame 
rule drag pop insensitive jitter
