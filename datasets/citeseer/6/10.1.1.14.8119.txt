designs architectures available academic government commercial systems appendix standardisation methods standardisation called data cleaning attribute level reconciliation 
standardisation true matches wrongly designated non matches common identifying attributes sufficient similarity 
basic ideas standardisation replace spelling variations commonly occurring words standard spelling 
standardise representation various attributes system units coding system 
example gender attribute 
perform integrity checks attribute values combinations attribute values 
standardisation methods need specific population application data capture processes 
example common name misspellings differ origin name 
standardisation italian names optimised handle names italian latin origin perform better generic standardisation 
searching blocking searching blocking reduce number comparisons record pairs bringing potentially linkable record pairs 
attribute variable blocking contain large number attribute values fairly uniformly distributed attribute low probability reporting error 
errors attributes blocking result failure bring linkable record pairs 
text attributes various phonetic codes derived avoid effects spelling aural errors recording names

kelley developed algorithm choosing best blocking scheme light trade computation cost false negative rates 
sorted neighbourhood method snm snm involves scanning sorted records sources fixed size window pair records falling window compared :10.1.1.46.6676
snm requires record comparisons 
note error rate induced snm critically dependent choice sorting keys 
multiple passes independent sorting keys minimise number errors :10.1.1.46.6676
transitive closure matched record pairs computed combining results independent passes 
example circumstances useful follows matches drop matches drop match matched result kept separate reality entity

result apt north rd apt north st semantics strings domain dependent comparison functions help avoid problem 
example apt apt parsed tagged apartment number comparison function capture difference digit significant records matched 
string comparator function returns value depending degree match strings 
pairs strings exhibit typographical variation smith record linkage needs effective string comparison functions deal typographical variations 
hernandez stolfo discussed possible distance functions measuring typographic errors edit distance phonetic distance typewriter distance

jaro definition common agreeing character half length shorter string 
jaro definition transposition character string order corresponding common character string 
string comparator value formula ls ls strings compared lengths ls ls respectively 
numbers common characters transpositions 
winkler modified original string comparator introduced jaro ways weight assigned similar character counting common characters 
winkler model similar characters includes may occur due scanning errors versus key punch errors versus 
weight agreement string 
observation fewest typographical errors occur string error rate increases character positions string 
string comparison value adjusted strings longer characters half characters agree
