expressed telecom industry quickly evolving pots plain old telephone services pans pretty new services 
new services able utilise power internet ip multimedia mobile systems number new services grows potential interactions services inevitably explode

non traditional interaction scenarios number interactions identified previous position listed details reader referred blair 
combining traditional telecommunications service internet access potential interactions services tcp flow control mechanisms protocol interactions general sharing demand network bandwidth web browsing viewing video stream interactions occurring multipoint conferencing units mobile resource interactions concerning bandwidth power management problems tcp wireless networks number interactions identified lancaster mobile computing see 
summary scenarios concern conflicting adaptation policies 
attempt maintain appropriate level quality service mobile systems employ various adaptation mechanisms 
problems interactions may arise separate adaptation mechanisms employed different attributes 
examples include mechanisms adapt manage power consumption network bandwidth proxy behaviour web browsing choice location sensing mechanism 
example consider mobile device employs independent adaptation mechanisms managing power managing network bandwidth 
power running low power management mechanism request applications network bandwidth postpone place network device sleep mode 
consequence network adaptation mechanism detect unused bandwidth notify applications spare bandwidth direct conflict power management adaptation mechanism 
note interesting dimension adaptation user configuration devices user express preferences different adaptation policies depending context 
example power management mechanisms may crucial user working field important office alternative power supply exists

allowing new components added existing software packaged components obtain incremental development model evolutionary dynamic architectures 
raises key questions compose architecture confident components unwanted subtle interactions result coherent 
adapt architecture confident replacements updates behave expected especially tandem components 
existing component methodologies provide little way support problems
