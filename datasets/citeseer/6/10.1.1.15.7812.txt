lewin note dialogue management includes turn management speak long topic management spoken utterance understanding understanding content utterance context previous dialogue intention understanding understanding point aim utterance context previous dialogue context maintenance maintaining dialogue context intention generation generating system objective current dialogue context utterance generation generating suitable form express intention current dialogue context 
dialogue management instantiate genre tutorial dialogue 
chi analysis corpus human tutorial dialogue indicate tutorial dialogue manager understand student utterances respond appropriately ignore student confusion encourage student recognise correct errors abandon questions longer relevant handle multiple student actions turn deal student initiated topic changes
