claim approach grossly underestimates importance complexity effective presentation design 
properly expect human professional designers understand 
underlying semantics client information 
effective order grouping priorities structuring information 
effective means chosen medium convey information 
information presentation design inherently knowledge driven process 
requires sufficient knowledge domain able convey essential semantic relations presentation

example apply xslt transformation css style sheet biography structure produce presentation formats html 
methods suited generate rdf xml structures rdf graphs 
applied rdf languages css xslt operate purely xml level rdf serialization syntax understanding support semantics rdf data model 
domain knowledge essential conveying underlying message transformation process needs access knowledge rdf schema level able query underlying domain ontology 
addition discourse knowledge stored rdf schema ontology rdf schema support required gain access transformation operating knowledge 
prototyped transformations java prolog environments direct access sesame rdf schema repository 
sesame server store rdf rdf schema knowledge 
key advantage approach transformation longer needs access rdf xml syntax level gain direct access rdf instance level rdf schema level query languages supported sesame currently rql rdql serql 
approach allows domain discourse knowledge explicit usually remains implicit xslt case java prolog transformation code modeling appropriate ontology

section show discourse design knowledge transform structured progression final form multimedia presentation 
structured progression transformed called document structure 
step decisions document genre traditional text interactive hypermedia passive multimedia 
traditional text step map biography specific elements generic document structure defined terms chapters sections structure atex structure article 
similar structures defined document genres multimedia presentation example defined terms scenes sub scenes 
second document structure transformed tree formatting objects 
step detailed layout formatting decisions 
traditional text involve decisions related typesetting normally word processors tex multimedia presentation includes determining exact timing presentation interaction style transition effects note advantages step process similar text multimedia cases 
mapping discourse specific narrative units general document elements second step defined commonly applicable formatting rules 
text case means define precise formatting disc unit 
mapped document section element relying common formatting rules section level elements 
similar advantages apply multimedia case 
example specifying explicitly transition effects applied disc disc career units prefer specify generic scene sub scene level narrative units mapped multimedia document structures 
unfortunately disadvantages approach similar 
main drawback looks detail comes level longer effectively specified terms document structure 
case text article example section subsection paragraph level conveniently expressed atex 
content structure tables effectively represented atex defines sufficiently rich document structure 
level detail biography narrative document structure unit type role multimedia section scene section scene career section scene spouse subsection sub scene career master subsection sub scene child subsection sub scene career technique subsection sub scene 
table example mapping narrative units document structure 
longer conveniently expressed atex 
created external drawing tool included postscript 
result perspective document structure black box 
semantics remain implicit formatting black box done manually 
multimedia case situation worse 
relatively new genre multimedia documents evolved common structure rich textual documents 
zooming multimedia document sooner reaches moment longer conveniently represent intended semantics document structure 
practice reaches point option leaving formatting material detailed document structure human designer feasible 
step detailed structures copied directly document structure define specific rules second step deal formatting directly 
structured progression document structure described previously structured progression defines grouping ordering priorities disc narrative unit instances 
describes main message author wants convey relates organizes narrative units contributing relevant information message 
structures information defining hierarchical ordering differentiating detailed general information 
information presentation remains 
human author uses different mechanisms depending context transform information perceivable document 
includes selection media items choice document genre multimedia presentation document 
structure narrative case modeled structured progression partly conveyed document structure 
traditional text documents chapters sections paragraphs reflect underlying narrative structure chapters general sections 
multimedia presentations similar structure explicit call scenes sub scenes 
generic grouping mechanisms appropriate formatting rules defined 
main goals rules identify sub scene boundaries example transition effects hyperlinks 
right page represents scene thumbnail images corner hyperlinks scenes 
table shows example mapping discourse structures appropriate document structures 
example narrative unit represented section document scene multimedia presentation 
narrative units generate sub narrative units subsequently result arbitrary number levels structured progression mapping general explicit 
addition document structure documents chapter section subsection tends fine grained document structure multimedia presentations scene sub scene 
consequence generating multimedia presentations partly bypass document structure documents 
needs able convey semantic discourse relations directly means spatial temporal layout 
examples relation paintings titles application specific expressed generic document structure 
escape mechanism allow information copied literally multimedia document structure specific formatting rules determine formatting domain semantics directly 
conveying document structure final step discussed transformation document structure set presentation constructs specify formatting decisions needed generate multimedia presentation 
includes assigning layout clues allow reader recognize document structure underlying semantic relations 
documents typically realized typographic conventions large bold face fonts headings mark new section chapter 
multimedia presentations similar typographic conventions multimedia specific means 
scene boundaries example conveyed transition effects hyperlinks traverse scene 
process transforming document structure presentation constructs uses library see details 
library uses constraint solving techniques verify presentation construct conforms delivery context constraints screen size 
constraints violated library allows specify alternative formatting strategies discard construct 
anticipate formatting failure transformation process needs proceed bottom requiring transformation leaf nodes document structure 
user may want able distinguish visually disc disc career transformation needs knowledge type narrative corresponding scene 
addition role characters scene need specified presentation disc son may need different presentation disc spouse 
rule transforms document structure corresponding narrative unit presentation construct discourse parameters disc disc role 
discourse parameters allow system adapt formatting presentation convey message effectively 
parameters defined discourse ontology subsumption reasoning generalize rules making applicable presenting multiple discourse relations 
example rule presents disc painter generalized disc artist case rule applicable disc 
conveying discourse semantics directly mentioned non trivial application specific details domain discourse semantics effectively expressed generic document structure 
allow semantics copied document structure 
result formatting step needs specific rules deal type information addition rules discussed deal document structure proper 
experimented specific rules different types knowledge determine formatting 
discourse knowledge example disc portrait disc painting disc represent concepts directly means media item concepts mapped directly equivalent concepts multimedia design ontology mm painting 
depending function discourse need define different media types formatted 
example image rembrandt require different formatting type formatting functions disc portrait disc section functions example disc painting illustrating technique 
addition system needs knowledge deal media items related discourse group terms document presentation constructs 
example need able group range paintings slide show choose different solution version 
media characteristics building balanced coherent presentation needs aware differences various media modalities 
text images audio video different impact way presentation perceived user system needs aware differences addition different media types different formatting requirements 
images paintings example fixed aspect ratio text boxes descriptions wide range acceptable aspect ratios 
hand media types share important characteristics 
example rules mentioned discriminate disc portrait disc painting 
rules fail missing fall back rule defines generic formatting images 
rule applied media type ontology defines mm painting mm portrait subclasses mm image 
addition similar subsumption fall back rules required groupings 
absence specific rules group paintings slide shows fall back rules specifying generic formatting group images required 
practice variety document discourse structures media items intended layout effects possible combinations quickly result overwhelming number rules explicitly specified 
ontological knowledge generalize rules matching entire subtrees individual cases 
cases rules generic specific rules added 
approach provides redundancy exploited backtracking 
case rule applied example hardware constraints resulting presentation fit screen alternative rule invoked automatically
