access publications subject clicking subjects button brings list subjects represented 
access publications title clicking titles brings list books alphabetic order 
access publications organization dublin core publisher bringing list organizations 
access publications listing yielding list hints defined collection editors 
dublin core base extend ad hoc manner accommodate individual requirements collection designers 
files collection new collection created material added existing original source documents brought system process known importing involves converting documents simple html format known gml greenstone markup language includes metadata associated document 
documents assumed unicode utf code ascii characters form subset 
files directories separate directory collection contains subdirectories original raw material import gml files created archives final collection served users index directory building process building supporting files including configuration file controls collection creation procedure 
additional files required example building hierarchy classifications requires data file sub classifications 
imported documents order identify documents internally unique object identifier oid assigned original source document imported formed hashing content overcome file duplication effects caused mirroring stored metadata document 
important oids persist process user search history unaffected rebuilding collection 
oids assigned hashing contents original source document 
imported document stored subdirectory archives associated files example images 
ensure compatibility windows characters directory file names causes annoying essentially trivial complications 
inside documents gml format imposes limited amount structure documents 
documents divided paragraphs 
split hierarchically sections subsections 
oids extended identify components appending numbers separated periods document oid 
book read section hierarchy visible table contents 
chapters sections subsections pages implemented simply sections document 
collections documents hierarchical subsection structure split pages permit browsing retrieved document 
document structure searchable indexes 
levels index documents sections paragraphs corresponding distinctions gml hierarchical structure flattened purposes creating indexes 
indexes text metadata combination 
create searchable index section titles authors document descriptions document text 
updating existing collections updating existing collection new files format easy 
example raw material hdl supplied form html files marked toc tags split books sections subsections tags indicate image inserted 
book library directory contains single html file representing book separate files containing associated images 
accompanying spreadsheet file contains classification hierarchy converted simple file format excel save command 
collection exists directory set subdirectories import archives building index directory contain suitable collection configuration file 
updating procedure browsing titles hdl update collection new raw material placed import directory form available 
import process invoked converts files gml specified plugins 
old material gml files previously created re imported 
build process invoked build requisite indexes collection 
contents building directory moved index directory new version collection automatically live 
procedure may cumbersome 
steps necessary efficient operation large collections 
import process performed fly building operation building indexes multipass operation lengthy importing repeated times 
build process take considerable time day large collections 
consequently results placed building directory collection exists continue served users old form building operation 
active users collection disturbed new version live probably notice 
persistent oids ensure interactions remain coherent users examining results query browse operation retrieve expected documents search progress change takes place program detects resulting file structure inconsistency automatically transparently re executes query time new version collection 
works original material import directory may format plugins required process format type 
plugins collection uses specified collection configuration file 
import program reads list plugins passes document plugin order finds process 
updating existing collection plugins necessary process new material specified configuration file 
building step creates indexes searching browsing 
mg software generally searching witten module automatically invoked create indexes required 
example humanity development library indexes entire books chapters section titles

information browsing indexes appear buttons greenstone search browse bar extracted building process stored database 
classifier program required browsing index extract appropriate information gml documents 
plugins classifiers written ad hoc basis particular information required possible reused collection 
building program creates indexes appears archives directory 
plugin specified collections processes gml files archives contains imported files processed correctly 
contains material original format converted appropriate plugin 
import process optional 
gml designed fast easy parse important requirement millions documents processed 
simple requiring tags lower case example yields substantial speed 
certain circumstances preferable standardized format xml 
straightforward implement just write xml plugin done 
transitory nature imported data date gml satisfactory beneficial format 
creating new collections building new collections scratch slightly different updating existing collection 
key new requirement creating collection configuration file software utility provided help 
pieces information required name directory collection source data files eventually placed contact mail address problems encountered software collection running 
utility creates files directories newly named directory support generic collection plain text documents 
suitable data placed import directory building collection point yield document level searchable index text browsable list titles defined case document filenames 
enhance functionality presentation trivial collection require configuration file edited 
collection sourced documents supported data format similar fashion existing collection searching bookmarked web pages amount editing minimal 
importing new data formats browsing metadata ways currently supported complex activities require programming skills 
modifying configuration file shows simple alterations generic configuration file generated new collection utility 
replaced line reads email files extracts metadata date subject 
classifier dates added line collection browsable chronologically 
default presentation search results overridden line display title message dublin core title sender dublin core author 
elements square brackets title replaced metadata associated particular document 
built term icon produces suitable image represents document book icon page icon link link construct forms hyperlink complete document 
format statement case solely table cell tags html passed page displayed 
example shows creating new collection stays bounds library established capabilities falls capability computer users instance computer trained librarians 
extending greenstone handle new document formats browse metadata new ways challenging 
writing new plugins classifiers extensibility obtained plugins classifiers 
modules code slotted system enhance capabilities 
plugins parse documents extracting text metadata indexed 
classifiers control metadata brought form browsable data structures 
specified object oriented framework inheritance minimize amount code written 
plugin specify things file formats handle parsed plugin recursive 
file formats normally determined regular expression matching filename 
example html plugin accepts files htm html htm html 
quite possible write plugins look inside file 
files plugin returns undefined file passed plugin collection configuration file line 
plugin parses file returns number documents processed 
involves extracting text metadata adding library content calls add text add metadata 
plugins recursive ones add extra files stream data processed building phase artificially list plugins 
directory hierarchies traversed 
plugins small modules code easy write 
monitored time took develop new different produced far 
chose example collection html bookmark files motivation produce convenient way searching browsing bookmarked web pages 
shows user searching bookmarked pages music 
new plugin took hour write lines long ignoring blank lines comments average length existing plugins 
classifiers general plugins gml format data 
example plugin generates date metadata accordance dublin core request collection browsable chronologically specifying classifier collection configuration file 
classifiers elaborate plugins new ones seldom required 
average length existing classifiers lines 
classifiers specify things initialization routine individual documents classified final browsable data structure 
initialization takes care options specified configuration file metadata title line 
classifying individual documents iterative process call document classify 
presentation document oid necessary metadata located control document added browsable data structure constructed 
documents added request completed data structure 
classifiers return data structure directly transform data structure returned 
example classifier browsing newspaper collection date divides alphabetically sorted list metadata separate pages size returns alphabetic ranges
