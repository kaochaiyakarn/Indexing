reducing lexically recoverable distinctions eliminated certain pos distinctions recoverable syntactic structure

similarly penn treebank tagset conflates subordinating conjunctions prepositions tagging categories 
distinction categories lost conjunctions recovered instances precede clauses prepositions instances precede noun phrases tional phrases 
emphasize lexical syntactic recoverability inherent pos tagged version penn treebank corpus allows users employ richer tagset small described section need arises 
consistency 
noted reason eliminating pos tag rn nominal adverb lexical recoverability 
important reason doing consistency 
instance brown corpus deictic adverbs tagged rb adverb counterparts inconsistently tagged rb adverb rn nominal adverb identical syntactic contexts preposition 
clear reducing size tagset reduces chances tagging inconsistencies 
syntactic function
