data mining discover associations concepts derive rules 
rest section describe aspects detail 
document selection successful knowledge discovery requires sufficient document collection 
document collection span domain interest concepts associations adequately represented 
addition collection provide transactions statistically significant rules mined 
furthermore document granular provide crisp associations focused set concepts 
document segmentation framework issue constitutes document important 
approach document defines transaction creates associations concepts 
analogy traditional data mining example document market basket concepts assigned metadata constitute items basket 
collection large documents may useful segment chapters paragraphs passages achieve right level granularity 
metadata schema metadata defined data data associated documents usually intended aid searching organizing summarizing large collections 
metadata generalized way gather structured information free text documents 
faceted metadata form knowledge representation akin templates frames slots 
metadata facets represent orthogonal sets concepts example people locations dates 
constraining data mining analyze occurrences concepts particular facets exercise considerable control knowledge discovery process 
approaches text mining natural language processing information extraction select set keywords phrases analyzed 
lead vocabulary problem differences word usage synonyms homonyms spelling errors lead spurious results 
establishing fixed set concepts facet control vocabulary rule mining phase 
text categorization creating metadata tedious expensive lead inconsistent results done completely manually 
automated text categorization practical way create metadata records large collections documents 
main cost training tuning classifier 
classifiers fairly easy adjust allows metadata schema changed needs knowledge discovery project 
text categorization assignment relevant categories documents number machine learning techniques developed automate process 
training sufficient number example documents associations words documents concepts categorization scheme 
different classifiers trained assign categories conceptually distinct taxonomies populate metadata facet 
accuracy text categorization issue 
sufficient training automated classifiers achieve close human levels accuracy inherent error rate 
data mining usually relies statistically significant occurrences concepts inaccuracies category assignments somewhat mitigated lead spurious occurrences statistically significant 
classifier inaccuracies biased case reduce quality mined rules 
data mining data mining phase comprised statistical techniques algorithms discover knowledge rules relationships concepts 
successful data mining leads discovery facts non trivial previously unknown
