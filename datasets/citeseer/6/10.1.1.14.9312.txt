requisite properties underlying semantic theory different semantic theories different commitments respect complete ness definiteness required interpretation 
information needed compute unique interpretation utterance available time utterance occurs discourse ways theory treats partial information affects computational tractability basis discourse interpretation 
merely utterances contain partial information may subsequent utterance sufficient information available comput ing unique interpretation 
matter rich model context possible fully constrain interpretation utterance occurs 
especially true definite noun phrase interpretation 
example tations possible noun phrase vice president united states utterance vice president united states president senate 
interpretation individual currently vice president provides appropriate basis interpretation subsequent utterance right president key person negotiations congress 
different interpretation retains descriptive content pro vides appropriate basis interpretation pronoun slightly different subsequent utterance historically president key person negotiations congress 
semantic theory forces unique interpretation utterance require computational theory system manage alternatives simultaneously provide mechanism retracting choice trying
