delegation important interleaving composition algorithm provider agent selection execution services 
user agent handle interleaving 
due reasons 
user agent receiving offers provider agents working composition services time executing services 
execution may require user agent migrate domains 
challenging provider agents keep track user agent continue submitting offers user agent 
furthermore offers provider agents sent common repository storing purposes user agent browse repository remotely inconvenient due potential networking problems 
reasons illustrate importance having delegate agent working behalf user agent 
reliability execution reliability web service defined probability request submitted web service correctly responded maximum expended time frame

reliability technical measure depends hardware software configuration web services network connections requestors service providers 
reliability value computed historical data past invocations example number times web service successfully delivered maximum expected time frame regard total number invocations 
reliability deals service execution failures backup approaches deemed appropriate
