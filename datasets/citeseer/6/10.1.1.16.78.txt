composition method requires individual controllers define pre conditions post conditions expected performance 
pre conditions denoted set conditions state character environment 
demonstrated successful composition controllers manually determined pre conditions learned automatically support vector machine svm technique learns appropriate pre conditions repeated sampling behavior individual controllers operation 
pre conditions met controller operate possibly enable character satisfy post conditions denoted referring range states character may execution controller 
controller realizes transition domain input states range output states character 
unexpected changes environment transition may succeed motivates notion expected performance denoted controller able evaluate performance order detect failure point operation 
controller continually aware current expected state character environment 
time step physics simulation supervisor controller checks needs initiate bid process proceeds userspecified target state changed active controller default controller 
bidding process available individual controllers determine pre conditions satisfied bid control dynamic character 
supervisor controller selects collection bidding controllers returns highest priority registers active controller invokes method associated controller implements control strategy 
method returns supervisor controller status parameter 
status parameter indicates controller failed new bidding process initiated 
status parameter method returns target values dynamic character degrees freedom associated stiffness damping parameters set proportional derivative controllers calculate actual control torques 
alternatively active controller choose apply torques directly character return values supervisor proportional derivative controllers 
case available controller bids control supervisor controller activates default controller generic controller describe detail tries sensible character specialist controller able assume control 
controllers automatically bid control character preconditions met controller transitions occur autonomously protective step response loss balance 
actions initiated voluntarily associated controllers active request user 
example character balancing upright instructed remain standing sit walk take dive

commands increase suitability score designated controller forces invocation arbitration process selects activates designated controller 
control voluntary motions delegated high level planner motion planning scope current 
post conditions may include conditions general merely involve final state
