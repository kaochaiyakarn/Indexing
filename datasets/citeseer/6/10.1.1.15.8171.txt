create acceptable levels quality service qos designers need able predict users behaviour response different levels qos 
predicting behaviour requires understanding users requirements specific tasks contexts 
reports qualitative experimental research demonstrates network service old principle service associate cost represent value terms contribution customers goals 
human computer interaction hci methods applied identify users goals associated qos requirements 
firstly qualitative approach establish mental concepts users apply assessing network services charges 
subsequent experimental study shows users require certain types feedback user interface predict levels quality 
price regulate demand qos 
number internet users expected triple largely new applications videoconferencing new services ecommerce 
shift usage imposes higher quality service qos requirements different levels granularity 
means traditional internet way managing quality best effort replaced service oriented approach service providers need find way creating revenue 
traffic produced different applications characterized associated payment 
example high volume video may prioritized associating high price 
majority pricing schemes assumption amount type quality detectable network identical quality paid users 
design sociotechnical environments evolving internet solely technical considerations 
definition integration requirements users technology take place 
stakeholders design internet services server designers network providers advertisers companies products sold line consumers 
vision internet offers potential break traditional barriers communications commerce current level service satisfy requirements users 
failure understand users qos requirements may affect users conception commercial viability turn affects business interests service providers advertisers 
internet users support greater diversity internet applications 
potential change way consumers interact companies 
research needed identify users requirements qos schemes charge 
identification possible achieve customer satisfaction leads success commercial system 
aim research define users requirements network qos charging investigate relationship users assessment qos different contexts mental models motivate assessment 
ultimate aim research provide models predict users demand qos priced situations 
reported establishes users requirements network service designers need know design decisions support users goals 
developed models aid integration users requirements qos systems design immediate practical benefits systems designers users 
study reported structured stages construct conceptual models motivate users perceptions network qos charging mechanisms 
capture users evaluations objective qos different contexts 
previous results predictability effect applying flat usage charging mechanisms telephone service extensively studied late seventies 
shown users reduced usage network faced usage charging 
additionally customers choose flat rate option regardless amount calls 
results indicate predictability simplicity charges criteria valued customers pay usage levels require 
study american households shown families want install phone lines uncertain magnitude bills incurred usage 
results suggest adequate feedback mechanism informing customers charges increase acceptability usage charges 
quota charging suggested quotas certain important qos drivers bought prior network 
users dynamic choice quota particular transaction 
user perspective scheme combines predictability bounded usage flexibility request increased qos needed 
quota scheme average rate service requests optimal user considering price anticipated delay 
predictability fundamental qos drivers user perspective 
concept risk assessment directly linked predictability low risk situation predictable 
suggests users prepared accept charging mechanisms predictable 
somewhat contrary findings studies suggest users prefer able dynamically change levels qos receive line value task performed 
dynamic pricing needs provide feedback network congestion enable users predict risk involved making certain payments 
risk users risk assessment qos receive represents value money 
assess risk users consider sub concepts relevance different sub concepts depend users level knowledge experience 
users tolerance certain levels qos consequently qos prepared pay depends expectations 
suggests network provide feedback users allowing accurate predictions quality 
context interaction previous research shown users judge acceptability pricing schemes variety dimensions 
salience dimensions determined fact technically implementable semantic value 
networked multimedia applications particular variations quality network level directly linked subjective assessment quality received users 
suggests users pay qos receive terms media quality require complete goal 
example real time video tasks participants previous studies mentioned ability manage video image terms operations resizing important 
clearly users need resize video image depends value placed seen image 
qualitative study method phenomena investigation complex 
approach study combine qualitative experimental research 
qualitative data needed investigate users motivations conceptual models 
focus groups collect data acceptability different charging mechanisms detail users responsibility payment line usage charges 
grounded theory methods analyze focus group data

attitudes budgeting participants think budget making calls vs absolute minute charge 
results main results focus groups show absolute price predictor users subjective perception quality 
means service provider assume charging twice providing twice speed web page download doubles subjective value quality users 
users conceptions quality influenced number contextual social factors 
users distinction need awareness charge control charge chance users dynamically directly reflect qos needs interaction 
peace mind 
peace mind top level goal situations users aware charge interaction 
describes state mind arising users ability commit call experience unacceptable changes price qos force re evaluation commitment 
usage trade offs 
users able control qos receive dynamic fashion usage trade offs terms time 
users tradeoffs concerning charging schemes particular times day particular tasks 
example ll think important call important won 
making long distance call won land line ll different scheme cheaper 
commitment 
users commitments interaction 
front assessment importance interaction trade offs terms call important time 
means users want constantly re evaluate value interaction 
key provide initial feedback gains users confidence ability control qos 
enhances users commitment interaction 
illustrate understanding going ll get meet want suppose peace mind thing 
tell going go ahead know ll complete call 
participants stressed benefits pre paid packages 
popular example provider difference expenditure chosen tariff cheaper tariff users particular type usage month 
provides users confidence commit interaction guarantee interaction represents value money 
trust 
notion trust plays important role influencing requirements dynamic control qos schemes charge qos 
trust concerned users trusting service provider 
allowing users dynamically control charges qos making users aware expenditure commitment interaction encourages users believe risk making inappropriate assessment quality 
users trusting ability re evaluate appropriately induces unacceptable cognitive load sense anxiety knowing time costing feel paranoid ll go knowing judge right 
providing continuous charging feedback making users aware continuous charging feedback possible promotes sense mistrust service provider 
users feel usage monitored violation sense privacy control outcome expenditure 
critical periods 
users attach concept critical period charging scheme 
users set critical period specifying critical threshold see 
allows ascribe different values interactions whilst retaining peace mind exceed upper bound 
type tariff determines critical period 
example critical period pre paid tariff mobile telephone call cause allowance run 
users commit call inability predict levels service 
critical thresholds 
critical threshold upper price bound specified user default settings applied interactions associated task 
data networks users want able predict particular transaction exceed critical threshold selected 
able assess commitment interaction 
example say don spend pounds tell web page selection take excellent know go ahead 
critical periods definition critical threshold dependent type tariff users 
example critical threshold specified terms time hate time run cut important call want say ok amount time left know get thing
