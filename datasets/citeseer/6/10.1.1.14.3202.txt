probabilistic multimedia retrieval framework probabilistic models textual visual information retrieval integrated seamlessly 
framework facilitates searching imagery textual descriptions visual examples simultaneously 
underlying language models text gaussian mixture models images proven successful various retrieval tasks 
categories subject descriptors information storage retrieval information search retrieval general terms design keywords multimedia retrieval mixture models language models 
basically ways specifying visual information need exist textual words describe images video visual presenting example looking sketch similar image 
parallel exist techniques disclosing collections visual material indexing collateral texts captions subtitles manual annotations standard text retrieval techniques extracting visual features documents measuring visual similarity query example paradigm 
rarely approaches combined 
course systems offer search modalities exist textual search solve page zero problem find set images start browsing truly integrated different modalities allow search textual visual features simultaneously exception cf
