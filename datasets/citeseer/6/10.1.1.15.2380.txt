negotiating agents efficiently auction mechanisms reaching agreements agents issue consideration associated items 
multi attribute item characterized attributes price non price quality attributes 
example service characterized quality supply time risk involved case service supplied eventually 
telephone service providers internet portals video demand suppliers rent extra storage capacity suppliers internet 
attributes required item domain storage capacity access rates data availability period time limit level security task allocation attributes deal include size task starting time deadline accuracy level international logistics supply chain domain required service moves cargo location 
details service include arrival time dispatching time path length weight volume real world situations essential conclude negotiation agents reach agreement strict deadline 
example auctioned service provided soon negotiation agents concluded defined deadline 
example case video demand suppliers need rent extra capacity supplier internet 
case obvious extra storage capacity meaningless provided time needed 
deadline negotiation process auction mechanism essential issue

model auction model consists buyer agent auctioneer fixed number seller agents bidders 
buyer agent needs particular item service product begins auction process 
auction buyer announces item request consists item desired characteristics scoring rule describes preferences concerning item properties 
seller agent decides send bid specify full configuration offers 
buyer agent seller agent characterized utility function describes preferences 
multi attribute refer simple additive weighting saw method 
utility score saw method obtained adding contributions attribute 
methods obtaining multi attribute utility functions multiplying contributions various attributes 
saw method suits examples domain storage capacity refer 
utility function buyer associates value bid sum buyer level satisfaction various attributes values 
utility function seller associates utility value reflecting seller cost profit bid 
auctioneer announces scoring rule auction 
scoring rule associates score proposed bid auction protocol dictates winner best scored bid scoring rule 
assume participant knows utility function bidding costly 
model seller agent private information costs improving quality product sells performance 
seller agent bidder assumed characterized cost parameter private information 
increases cost seller achieve item higher quality increases seller weaker 
similar model described che assume independently identically distributed distribution function positive consciously differentiable density exists 
complete symmetry agents subscript omitted rest 
analyze general case multi attribute auctions arbitrary number attributes predefined known participants 
attributes price quality attributes preferences buyer sellers conflict 
assume qi increases quality item increases 
increases cost seller provide increases harder provide higher quality items 
addition buyer utility higher quality items increases 
example multi attribute service providing machine characterized attributes price item denote speed machine denote accuracy warranty period machine 
seller cost increases provides accurate machine buyer utility higher obtains machine 
example attribute service video demand supply price denotes storage capacity denotes access rate 
consider cost functions sellers 
assume fixed coefficients quality dimensions identical sellers 
coefficient coefficient similarly coefficient quality attribute seller cost function cs qm ai qi cost function seller utility function qm ai qi notice utility function seller difference price obtains cost producing proposed quality values 
payment obtains increases utility increases 
function fits case increases quality item service increases 
higher values causes higher costs seller lower utility 
influence assumed independent linear increases unit cost seller increase ai clear increases utility buyer increases 
assume independent linear increases influence additional unit smaller 
assumption valid domains 
example enlarging speed machine mhz mhz higher influence enlarging speed mhz mhz 
effect weighted respectively smaller larger 
increases importance attribute buyer increases price attributes 
buyer private utility function buyer announce scoring rule choosing bids 
scoring rule buyer different real utility function sense announced weights wi may different actual weights particular scoring rule form qm wi qi weights buyer assigns scoring rule infer announced bid value buyer qm wi qi announced values weights equal different real values weights example reason buyer declares lower utility derived unit actual utility publicized scoring rule agent interested selling item join auction send bid describing suggestion supply buyer agent requirements
