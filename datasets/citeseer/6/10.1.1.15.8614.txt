genius statistical approach lies estimation details 
important di erences result reversing things generate query document approach attractive estimation perspective 
primary importance reversed lies fact conditioning document larger estimating statistical model 
entire document potentially related documents build language model great deal known techniques estimating language models applications 
intuitively easier estimate model relevant queries document estimate model relevant documents query 
robertson sparck jones model encountered diculties estimating explicit relevance information available 
typically set constant estimated assumption entire collection comprised non relevant documents croft harper robertson walker essentially assumption 
better approach estimating proposed lavrenko croft query formally treated observation model generating relevant documents set empirical document language models exploited smooth estimate

potential advantage lies fact language modeling approach includes explicit notion importance document represented term log estimated separately 
previous formulations role played document prior berger la erty miller

particular query independent scores assess importance documents hyperlink analysis proven useful web search brin page 
additional di erence approaches lies need document normalization 
standard approach log odds ratios essential account fact di erent documents di erent numbers terms 
ranking document likelihoods ective procedure inherently biased long documents 
observation symptomatic larger problem making strong independence assumptions incorrect model relevant documents 
language modeling approach things reversed generate input query result competing documents scored number probabilities document normalization crucial issue 
generally incorrect independence assumptions model may mitigated predicting input

conceptually model intends infer probability document relevant query probability user likes document query 
formal derivation maron kuhns appears restricted queries single term

conceptually considered representing major types classical probabilistic models 
early orts unify classical probabilistic models robertson uni cation completely successful 
diculty encountered robertson restricted event space space cross product documents queries relevance variable 
doubt early recognizes symmetry queries documents
