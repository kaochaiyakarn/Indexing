dialogue game protocols identified key elements dialogue game protocol generic model formal dialogue game :10.1.1.16.848
assume dialogue occurs autonomous software agents topics discussion represented logical language represent topics formed formulae denoted lower case roman letters specification dialogue game protocol requires specification commencement rules rules define circumstances dialogue commences 
locutions rules indicate utterances permitted 
typically legal locutions permit participants assert propositions permit question contest prior assertions permit asserting propositions subsequently questioned contested justify assertions 
justifications may involve presentation proof proposition argument 
dialogue game rules may permit participants utter propositions assign differing degrees belief commitment example may merely propose proposition speech act entails commitment assertion proposition 
combination rules rules define dialogical contexts particular locutions permitted obligatory 
instance may permitted participant assert proposition subsequently proposition dialogue interim having retracted assertion 
commitments rules define circumstances participants express commitment proposition dialogue 
typically assertion claim debate defined indicating participants level commitment support claim 
formal dialogue systems typically establish maintain public sets commitments called commitment stores participant stores usually non monotonic sense participants retract committed claims possibly defined circumstances 
termination rules rules define circumstances dialogue ends 
comments model order 
firstly circumstances may lead commencement specific dialogue protocol strictly speaking part dialogue protocol 
accordingly reasonable consider meta dialogue discussions dialogues enter undertaken hierarchy nested sequential dialogues :10.1.1.16.848
secondly dialogue games different conversation policies short sequences legal utterances common purpose 
conversation policy sits single utterance complete dialogue length governs portion complete dialogue case dialogue game 
thirdly worth noting notion commitment literature dialogue games 
example hamblin treats commitments purely dialogical sense speaker obliged maintain consistency needs keep store statements representing previous commitments require new statement may added inconsistency store 
store represents kind persona beliefs need correspond real beliefs 

contrast walton krabbe chapter treat commitments obligations execute incur maintain course action term action commitments 
actions may utterances dialogue speaker forced defend proposition asserted attack walton krabbe consider propositional commitment special case action commitment 
hamblin treatment dialogical commitments propositions may necessarily represent participant true beliefs 
contrast singh social semantics requires agent participants interaction express publicly beliefs intentions expressions called social commitments 
include expressions belief propositions expressions intent execute incur actions 
primary motivation dialogue games basis interaction protocols autonomous agents 
agents typically enter interactions order achieve wider objectives just enjoyment interaction believe reasonable define commitments terms actions propositions external dialogue 
commercial negotiation dialogue instance utterance offer may express willingness speaker undertake subsequent transaction terms contained offer 
reason view commitments mappings locutions subsets set action statements 

classifying dialogues different sorts agent dialogues 
assume agents enter dialogues order achieve specific objectives reasonable classify dialogues terms private shared objectives participants 
criteria private objectives shared objectives argumentation theorists doug walton erik krabbe influential typology human dialogues 
addition typology information participant commencement dialogue relevance topic discussion 
result primary types dialogue follows information seeking dialogues participant seeks answer question participant believed know answer 
inquiry dialogues participants collaborate answer question questions answers known participant 
persuasion dialogues involve participant seeking persuade accept proposition currently endorse 
negotiation dialogues participants bargain division scarce resource 
goal dialogue division resource acceptable worth noting notions commitment differ commonly discussion agent internal states idea persistence belief intention 
singh argues qualitative difference social commitments kind discussed personal commitments kind encoded beliefs desires intentions 
argues kind commitment derived 
may conflict individual goals participants maximize individual shares 
participants deliberation dialogues collaborate decide action course action adopted situation 
participants share responsibility decide course action share willingness discuss shared responsibility 
note best course action group may conflict preferences intentions individual member group participant may information required decide best group 
dialogues participants verbally substitute physical fighting aiming vent perceived 
rule governed ignore dialogues 
actual dialogue occurrences involve mixtures primary dialogue types 
purchase transaction example may commence request potential buyer information seller proceed persuasion dialogue seller seeks persuade potential buyer importance feature product transition negotiation party offers give desires return 
parties may may aware different nature discussions phase transitions phases 
agent communications languages articulated formal models capable representing complex combinations dialogue types :10.1.1.16.848
purposes note termination rules different dialogue types expressed succinctly terms utterances support dialogue certain propositions 
information seeking dialogue example terminate normally participant sought answer question indicates publicly proposition provides satisfactory answer 
normal termination inquiry dialogue designated subset participants express public indication 
persuasion dialogue normal termination occur participant persuaded publicly appropriate locution support proposition issue 
similarly normal termination rules negotiation deliberation dialogues may articulated terms participant support particular propositions cases propositions express commitments actions external dialogues 

classifying locutions agent dialogue types involve agents seeking reach common understanding situation collective agreement undertake certain actions 
theory communicative action philosopher jurgen habermas attempts understand human participants achieve goals dialogue part theory habermas proposes typology statements dialogues pp 

typology basis classification locutions agent dialogues habermas labels parentheses factual statements speech acts statements seek represent state objective external world 
statements belief factual matters examples utterances 
statement means denying true description reality external dialogue 
value statements expressive acts statements seek represent state speaker internal world habermas classification derived typology speech acts searle 
reveal publicly subjective preference value assignments 
statements may contested speaker 
connection statements acts statements assert social relationship different participants 
participant may assert example certain group people affected action consideration deliberation dialogue 
requests statements desired state external world agent seeks agent act bring state 
requests may criticized grounds effectiveness requested action fact bring desired world state 
addition may refused reason expressed 
promises statements desired state external world agent agrees act bring state 
requests promises may criticized grounds effectiveness may accepted rejected reasons 
inferences operative acts statements refer content earlier statements dialogue drawing inferences assessing implications 
statements take form questioning appropriateness validity inferences 
procedural statements communicative acts statements activity dialogue rules participation debate 
human discourses focus debate dominating issues substance 
dialogues participants may agree submit issues chairperson authority determination 
distinguishing requests promises way classification differs habermas 
include promises structure requests treated commands imperative acts requests 
believe approach appropriate context agent autonomy 
complete autonomy may occur example open multi agent systems means imperative statements may force agents requested perform action commanded 
closed multi agent systems agents may hierarchical relationship complete autonomy example represent different departments 
applications agents may exercise autonomy limited domain classification includes requests promises appropriate
