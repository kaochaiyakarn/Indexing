citeseer considered complementary commercial citation indices sci 
citeseer sufficiently accurate useful sci provide greater accuracy especially areas index informal citations referencing art body article 
avenues improvement algorithms enable aci 
example combinations methods identifying citations article may substantially improve performance learning techniques may improve aspects system 
citation indices sci limited number journals index indexing process requires manual effort corresponding economic reward 
justification selective indexing relatively small number journals accounts bulk significant scientific results 
fact small set journals accounts large percentage citations probably partially due information overload researchers may read small set journals significant results published argued citation indices tends emphasize particular journals indexed forms scientific communication 
widespread digital libraries aci promote dissemination literature 
definite disadvantages limited journal selection 
journal selection typically follows review process necessarily means articles making journal worthy indexing published previously unavailable citation index 
limitation journals excludes conferences monographs technical reports preprints sci indexes non journal items 
important new findings may conveyed short conference papers justifying journal publication ideas feedback previous require lengthy papers 
ideas feedback technical reports working papers conference papers far advance corresponding journal publication 
areas computer science significant conferences journal publication comes 
areas rapidly moving time conference journal publication significant 
broader coverage provided aci clearly helpful literature search allowing scientist find cites relevant scientist research 
features appears journal may indicative importance preprints specific authors feedback researcher 
reaches journal publication broader coverage preprints technical reports conference proceedings provide significant advantages timeliness increase productivity point limitations starting research limited value help reduce duplication research 
reach journal publication may contain important useful feedback connections scientific community 
citation statistics widely evaluation 
evaluation citation statistics lead erroneous 
authors receive similar number citations may different reasons small number researchers may cite little influence outside clique researchers produce significantly different quantities citations papers 
underlying assumption citations imply scholarly impact true 
said cited document important typically considered evaluating citation statistics 
evaluation journal citation statistics delayed journal reviewing publication processes meaning statistics may available citations may exist conference proceedings preprints 
making context citations easily quickly browsable aci help accurately evaluate importance individual contributions 
indexing broader selection literature including conference papers preprints aci help provide timely evaluation articles 
aci facilitates possibility autonomously classifying context citations learning techniques may useful large number citations 
investigating classification citation context classes supporting criticism followup review praise 
expect accuracy comparable humans expect learning techniques provide useful predictions analyzing manner citation usage words sentences surrounding citation 
example citation occurs group citations see classification supporting may probable 
cited times citing may followup
