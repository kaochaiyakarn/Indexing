quantifies performance grammar parser determines weaknesses providing direction productive development grammar 
second objective evaluation compare performance different parsers 
requires evaluation metric disregards representational differences output produced various parsers 
metric proposed scheme computes figures crossing bracket number brackets system parse cross treebank parse recall ratio number correct brackets system parse total number brackets treebank parse precision ratio number correct brackets system parse total number brackets system parse 
scheme served purpose providing cross representational evaluation metric performance various parsers quantified compared heretofore impossible task 
objections scheme crossing brackets measure penalizes 
precision measure penalizes parser inserting extra possibly correct brackets annotation treebank skeletal 
unclear scores scheme relate success parsing 
scheme evaluates performance parser 
applications parser may interested accuracy complete parse may care structures noun phrases appositives predicative nominals predicate argument relations 
evaluation parser application embedded 
scheme unsuitable evaluating partial parsers bracketing scheme inadequate represent forest disconnected trees typical case partial parser 
proposal parser evaluation overcomes limitations scheme applicable evaluating partial parsers 
intended serve metric evaluating parsers embedded applications 
application independent evaluation parse constituency parser hierarchically organized constituent structure parse dependency parser set dependency linkages words sentence 
propose mixed representation parse combines benefits representations hierarchical phrasal constituents flattened chunks noun chunks verb chunks preposition chunks relations chunks indicated dependency links certain words typically heads chunks 
dekang lin proposed dependency linkage model complete sentence 
evaluating representation amounts evaluating flat phrasal structures noun chunks verb groups preposition phrases disregarding attachment location evaluating correctness hierarchical structures dependencies words typically heads chunks 
dependency links labeled evaluation performed including labels 
application dependent evaluation applications parsers seldom entire parse structure produced parser 
typically interested specific grammatical constructions minimal maximal noun phrases appositives preposition phrase modifiers predicative constructions predicate argument relations 
degree difficulty accuracy identifying grammatical constructions parse depends representation adopted grammar underlying parser 
appropriateness representation task evaluated evaluating accuracy grammatical constructions identified
