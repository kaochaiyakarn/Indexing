joining collaborative content filtering patrick baudisch integrated publication information systems institute ipsi german national research center information technology gmd darmstadt germany baudisch gmd de different authors proposed combining content collaborative attributes single table 
article try different approach 
propose merge tables join tables relational database 
result get new application cases system architecture supports formulation universal queries 
keywords recommender system collaborative filtering contentbased enhancements relational database join sql user interface related past year number authors system designers experimented enhancing collaborative systems called recommender systems contentbased extensions 
purely collaborative systems single user object table enhanced systems introduce formal descriptors system 
enhancements observation content relation matches descriptor object compatible collaborative relation likes user object 
consequently relations stored single table shown table 
content attributes added additional rows table users content descriptors mixed 
words content descriptors treated additional users 
object object user ru ru user ru ru descriptor rd rd descriptor rd rd table introducing formal descriptors collaborative systems kinds content descriptors depends application domain 
grouplens help filter newsgroup articles 
experiments shown example formal descriptor high amount cited text predictor poor ratings alt rec humor newsgroup 
count number typographical errors simply measure message lengths 
uses called archetypes recommender system music videos books 
archetypes implement concept hypothetical users objects having specific property 
application domain properties product categories artists listening types 
primary purpose archetypes help overcome called rater problem 
rater problem means objects newly introduced system rated users recommended 
due absence recommendations users tend interested regarding new objects 
turn consequence newly added objects remain state recommendable 
real users affected problem archetypes motivated rate new objects early raters 
archetypes approach promising approach solving rater problem 
different approach article try different way introducing content descriptors collaborative systems 
similar systems described combine tables containing users formal descriptors 
merging tables joining 
mean joining sense relational databases 
purpose joining tables indirectly related rater problem 
way integrating collaborative systems content information systems generating new functionality directly available users 
remarks notation discussing individual concepts look high level 
implementation performance tricks important issue especially large scale recommender systems recommender systems large scale effectively look involved data structures simple relations 
implement described concepts necessary crucial consider efficient implementation 
general borrow number notations database systems sql syntax entity relationship diagrams 
aware fact actual calculations done information retrieval information filtering collaborative systems complicated ones suggested diagrams 
reading notations aware calculations notations different processing tables 
terminology 
information retrieval literature objects retrieved information systems usually referred documents 
admit documents multimedia objects hypertext 
article generally speaking objects explicitly describe text documents 
joining tables start looking tables individually 
content processing information retrieval information filtering systems perform calculations single relation descriptor object 
example objects text documents descriptors keywords 
shows involved entities single relation 
descriptor matches object entity relationship model contentbased information retrieval filtering relation direction joining relations shown table computed 
table contains names typical applications individual cases 
descriptors keywords associative thesaurus information retrieval filtering object indexing query example descriptors keywords object table applications content systems 
table rows input table columns output 
primary goal information systems retrieve filter objects 
right column table usually focus interest 
table cells left column thesauri indexing provide necessary helpful methods enhancing search 
retrieving objects queries formal descriptors objects 
case entered documents considered usually positive examples queried system returns set similar objects query example 
entering objects object manually proved difficult object queries usually handled extension keyword retrieval case 
users query system keyword query 
users pick positive negative examples returned set objects refine query relevance feedback 
approach union right cells table 
combine input data types keywords documents single query documents replaced expressive keywords documents 
collaborative processing collaborative systems calculations single relation user object 
shows involved entities single relation 
user likes object entity relationship model collaborative systems analogous content cases described relation address different scenarios shown table 
user matchmaker active collaborative filtering object find experts automated collaborative filtering user object table applications collaborative system cases retrieve objects form right column 
fields represent known versions collaborative filtering 
passive automated collaborative filtering users fill user profiles ratings objects solely profile query system 
case active collaborative filtering users addressed individually sending recommendations gathering recommendations 
fields left column return users objects 
interesting social aspects 
typical application matchmaking 
comparison basic differences collaborative content approaches 
users know stand meaning keywords formal descriptors necessarily know meaning collaborative descriptors users interests represent 
consequently keywords explain objects match 
names users describe objects users respective users known 
usually case community users small respective users known reasons opinion leaders 
restricts applicability active collaborative filtering 
joining relations provide system content collaborative information separate relations get entity relationship model shown 
descriptor matches user likes object entity relationship model combined system exploiting possible joins provides functionality content system functionality collaborative system shown table 
thick lines show uniting table rotated table generated table 
new aspects table compared original tables forming 
new cells created 
user descriptor cell turns user profiles sets formal descriptors 
function convert collaborative user profiles textual descriptions 
opposite case turning keywords users rapidly generate user profiles formal descriptions find experts topic

query example example implemented 
query formulation user interfaces system accepts parameter types formulate queries system implements cells column table users allowed combine input parameters single query 
example successful implementation concept relevance feedback 
consequently goal implementing center column table implement system allows combining objects formal descriptors users single query 
possibility combine terms boolean operators 
example movie domain give movies user lars likes descriptions containing words car race entered car race 
entering parameters entering formal descriptors generally text interface 
keywords stored inverted files retrieval system simple identified uniquely user types 
object user parameters difficult enter 
identifying user document typed text unambiguous 
entities identified internal users know 
mentioned case relevance feedback appropriate solution 
users describe desired entities formal descriptors 
query returns single entity entity selected automatically 
query returns number entities selection dialog started select 
input parameters different types mixed ambiguities type may occur 
movie recommendation system terminator search term movie nickname user 
users enter queries textual interface necessary resolve ambiguities annotating parameters type 
system allows retrieval different types entities user interface objects users users select kind entity want retrieve simple menu 
user interfaces user defined computation permit users apply extra relation pairs described retrieval syntax just described insufficient 
users provide parameters combine boolean operators guide computation application relations 
possible syntax functional syntax andrea
