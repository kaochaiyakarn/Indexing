lessons ethology computational implications importance inhibition fatigue inhibition plays important role ethological models action selection explain temporal aspects behavior 
generally agree animals engage behavior time tinbergen lorenz mcfarland 
animals typically pursue activity indefinitely detriment needs 
animals appear engage form time sharing mcfarland low priority activities chance execute despite presence higher priority activity 
animals typically dither multiple activities interrupt behavior behavior significantly appropriate 
models inhibition fatigue frequently explain aspects animal behavior 
essential action selection mechanism animats include explicit model inhibition fatigue 
model action selection algorithm proposed 
system complete action selection algorithm 
model activity feeding drinking value sum relevant internal external factors inhibition receives competing activities 
competing activities mutually inhibiting activity inhibits activity amount equal activity value times inhibitory gain kji 
higher gain greater inhibition effectively greater persistence active activity 
observation activities mutually inhibiting inhibitory gains restricted greater value activities restricted zero greater model result winner take system activity non zero value system stabilized 
practice true 
exceedingly rare converge solution particularly inhibitory gains 
activity non zero value said active 
model direct feedback loop activity endogenous factors depends activity active reduces value endogenous factors activity specific gain times value activity 
implementation algorithm relax assumption model context hierarchical structure 
example value feeding activity depends level hunger 
feeding activity includes number specific activities including searching food handling consuming 
animal engages activity level hunger reduced 
feeding activity relies activity lower hierarchy reduce value endogenous variables depends 
active activity stay active value value activities competes changes amount proportional inhibitory gain 
example eating active inhibits drinking gain value eating fall half value drinking drinking active 
value eating fall example response consuming food 
alternatively value drinking rise significantly response passing water source way food 
modifying inhibitory gains level persistence activity relative competes may adjusted accordingly 
activity associates specific inhibitory gain activity inhibits 
gains low system tends dither different activities result system takes longer reach levels 
higher gains active activity shows persistence effect reached sooner 
persistence comes expense opportunism 
needed simple inhibitory gains 
example high gains may result lower priority activities active 
example feeding may higher absolute priority body maintenance important creature able periodically interrupt searching food may clean 
part model suggested mechanism modeling behavior specific fatigue conjunction model inhibition implement timesharing

level fatigue influenced number factors activity active level fatigue increases proportion activity value implementing feedback loop reduces value active activity time

uses model replicate results mcfarland time sharing experiments mcfarland 
computational model draws heavily model 
important difference envisioned fiat structure competing activities mutually inhibiting 
chosen embed model loose hierarchical organization spirit tinbergen tinbergen activity competes subset activities level hierarchy 
turn discussion implications hierarchical structure 
importance hierarchies information sharing dawkins view hierarchical structure represents essential organizing principles complex behavior dawkins view echoed lorenz tinbergen davey mcfarland 
model represents example approach 
idea animal considered number activity systems collections activities organized address specific biological function 
activity systems organized loose overlapping hierarchies 
time system expressed movements animal 
example nesting represent competing activity systems herring number subordinate collections activities settling building trimming 
turn motor actions associated 
releasing mechanisms abstraction perceptual process signals biologically important object event endogenous variables hormone levels blood sugar levels determine part activity expressed 
implicit model notion level hierarchy decision alternatives chosen 
top decisions general feed versus drink increasingly specific moves hierarchy freeze 
number computational arguments advanced type hierarchy maes 
alternative totally fiat distributed structure strict winner take hierarchy tyrrell proposes free flow hierarchy nodes hierarchy influence subsequent behavior animat 
model proposed rosenblatt payton rosenblatt activities express weighted preferences activities lower hierarchy ultimately motor commands 
arbitration ultimately done motor controller level executes highly preferred motor action 
tyrrell argues free flow hierarchies avoid problems associated winner take hierarchies winner take hierarchies information lost decision point 
system unable arrive compromise solutions ultimately better creature preferences losing branches taken account 
problem reduced free flow hierarchies gets express preference 
winner take hierarchies structured way upper level nodes access sensory information nodes beneath hierarchy order right choice alternative branches 
results sensory bottleneck 
agree point convinced second case animats driven part internal needs 
tinbergen tinbergen initial decisions activity systems tend driven internal needs just sensory input take advantage opportunities 
sensory input relevant specific sub activity branch hierarchy irrelevant higher level decision systems 
second information flowing hierarchy levels releasing mechanisms endogenous variables associated different nodes hierarchy 
third winner take hierarchy provides focus attention allowing avoid processing irrelevant sensory data 
example animal hormone levels interest sex need check sensory input relevant behavior system 
ability free flow hierarchies arrive compromise solutions comes expense complexity 
particular mechanism combining preferences need chosen carefully performance system highly dependent careful tuning weights 
problem compounded fact activity express preference motor command weight uses represent preference determined independent weights activities particular motor action alternative motor actions 
pure free flow network loses attractive divide andconquer aspect hierarchical systems 
turn brings question easily system scale 
addition free flow hierarchies provide focus attention described earlier irrelevant sensory data may evaluated 
chosen implement winner take hierarchical model keeping traditional ethological models provide simple mechanism limited information sharing 
model activity ultimately final say set motor actions performed instant 
losing activities path winner may post recommendations various motor actions 
winner access recommendations form taxis potential modification underlying pattern behavior 
key point winning activity control wishes recommendations 
example anti predator system detects presence distant predator distant fact system active may post recommendations movement bring animat closer predator 
approach reflects ethological belief time activity control presumably important internal external state creature 
best position decide modify default pattern actions take preferences activities account 
approach model activities objects hopefully simple potentially complex internal logic decides motor commands executed 
design provides designer freedom decide activity recommendations activities 
common currency endogenous variables releasing mechanisms internal needs external opportunities need evaluated common currency 
idea described lorenz lorenz mcfarland mcfarland simply animal response external stimulus depends strength stimulus internal state 
imply key points 
stimulus precisely output releasing mechanisms needs measured continuous quantity opposed boolean see phenomenon 
second mechanism behavior systems animal effectively combining strengths relevant external internal factors way 
model properly internal needs external opportunities need expressed common currency 
generally agreed common currency sense clear output multiple releasing mechanisms combined external internal factors combined 
respect multiple independent external stimuli seitz law heterogeneous summation simple additive relationship lorenz may suffice cases 
simple rule may adequate combine external internal factors 
mcfarland argues expect decision criteria shape feeding shaped natural selection accordance animal ecological circumstances mcfarland 
way internal external factors combined behavior system determined natural selection var depending specific behavior system animal ecological niche 
tyrrell points important able accommodate different rules combination stimuli internal external factors presuppose strict summation multiplication 
important control relative ranges output specific releasing mechanisms allowed vary 
general greater range relative range internal factors greater reactiveness animat respect stimulus signaled releasing mechanism 
results greater persistence presence stimulus 
means increased likelihood behavior activities associated behavior system stimuli associated behavior system detected
