interesting comparison dominance tournament method pareto coevolution ficici pollack noble watson 
pareto coevolution method guiding selection dominance generation 
ranking pareto layers constructed iteratively finding non dominated individuals population 
individuals removed population pareto layer 
pareto layers partition single generation progressively lower rankings providing gradient evolution climb highest ranking layers reproduce proportion ranking form generation 
contrast dominance tournament dominance ranking individual champions different generations describes progress evolution 
notions dominance significantly different addition different purposes 
may possible extend pareto layer ranking generations data returned master tournament 
highest ranking pareto layer correspond final generations evolution giving evidence progress 
ficici pollack report cases highest ranking layer may contain population 
analysis quite coarsegrained compared dominance tournament 
addition master tournament pareto layer ranking requires strategy play strategy making computationally expensive 
third pareto layer ranking champions identify specific transition points analysis partitioning happens perfectly correspond contiguous generations 
pareto coevolution dominance tournament demonstrate dominance rankings wellsuited analysis coevolutionary problems
