unit slave piconets master slave piconet 
able link nodes piconet cases inadequate set densely connected sensor networks 
wanting communicate nodes time require sort time multiplexing additional nodes parked repeatedly 
setting additional piconets require gateway nodes alternate respective piconets bluetooth supports units active piconet time 
applications need slave slave communication provided bluetooth standard 
obvious workaround channel slave slave traffic master increasing traffic energy consumption 
alternatively slaves switch roles current master set additional piconet altogether

inquiry asymmetric procedure inquiring unit unit need complementary modes called inquiry inquiry scan 
bluetooth unit set inquiry mode continuously sends inquiry messages probe units 
inquiry mode continues previously specified time previously specified number units discovered stopped explicitly 
likewise bluetooth units listen reply inquiry messages explicitly set inquiry scan mode 
unit inquiry inquiry scan modes mutual exclusive time 
unit inquiry scan mode recognizes inquiry message replies inquirer 
complete inquiry procedure requires broadcast message sent inquirer message unit back inquirer 
inquiry initiated periodically interval inquiry instances determined randomly avoid bluetooth units synchronizing values taken 
procedures lock step
