face detection difficult main reasons 
faces similarly structured facial features arranged roughly spatial configuration large component non rigidity textural differences faces 
part elements variability due basic differences facial appearance individuals person larger nose person person eyes farther apart person person darker skin person 
images person face significant geometrical textural differences due changes expression presence absence facial makeup 
traditional fixed template matching techniques geometric model object recognition approaches rigid articulate objects tend perform inadequately detecting faces 
second face detection difficult certain common significant features glasses totally absent face 
furthermore features cloud basic facial features 
glare glasses may de emphasize darkness eyes variable appearance 
glasses come different designs

deformable template approach uses hand constructed parameterized curves surfaces model non rigid elements faces facial subfeatures eyes nose lips 
parameterized curves surfaces fixed elastically global template frame allow minor positional variations facial features 
matching process attempts align template pre processed versions image peak valley edge maps 
energy functional constrains alignment attracting parameterized curves surfaces corresponding image features penalizing deformation stress template 
best fit configuration minimizing energy functional serves closeness measure match 
image invariants image invariance schemes assume faces may vary greatly appearance variety reasons spatial image relationships common possibly unique face patterns 
detect faces compile set image invariants check positive occurrences invariants candidate image locations 
image invariance scheme set observed brightness invariants different parts human face 
underlying observation illumination changes significantly alter brightness levels different parts face local ordinal structure brightness distribution remains largely unchanged 
example eye regions face darker cheeks forehead possibly lighting conditions 
similarly bridge nose brighter flanking eye regions 
scheme encodes observed brightness regularities ratio template uses pattern match faces 
ratio template coarse spatial template face appropriately chosen sub regions roughly corresponding key facial features 
brightness constraints facial parts captured appropriate set pairwise brighter darker relationships corresponding sub regions 
image pattern matches template satisfies pairwise brighter darker relationships
