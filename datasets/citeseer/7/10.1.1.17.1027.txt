representation reconstruction edelman dept applied mathematics computer science weizmann institute science rehovot israel despite promise title tarr black representation reconstruction 
sentence tarr black effectively substitute concept reconstruction admittedly related general concept representation 
metonymic slip tongue characterizes approach taken mainstream computer vision research past fifteen years 
hand importance choosing right representation computational problem widely acknowledged forcefully argued marr 
hand generation vision researchers starting marr abandoned freedom gained realization representations may tailored task essentially ignoring possibility best representation visual world may visual world reconstructed full dimensional detail 
philosophy mind equation representation reconstruction spirit tradition dating back aristotle hume berkeley see 
computationally representation sense geometrical replica thing represented considered adequate visual task 
pragmatic perspective representation reconstruction appears poor choice reasons 
experience computer vision shows representation notoriously difficult recover real unconstrained data 
second information necessary solving visual task geometrically reconstructed scene necessarily encoded optimal form 
reconstructed scene require sense comment computational evolutionary perspective role representation vision tart black exact quotation assumed goal computer vision reconstruct representation scene criticized unproductive impractical 
mart book similar argument mere fourteen pages discusses possible approaches scene interpretation starts reconstruction roundabout reconstruction se contributes interpretation 
third psychophysical evidence indicates human performance recognition cases inconsistent hypothesis 
roots alternative approach representation shall attempt outline traced back locke essay 
part addressed problem semantics mental representations locke suggested idea represents thing world naturally predictably evoked thing necessarily idea resembles thing sense 
view standard terminology vision research activity sufficiently reliable feature detector constitutes representation presence appropriate feature visual world 
representations entire objects scenes built available primitives repertoire features sufficiently rich 
developments computer vision computational neuroscience indicate modified version old hypothesis representation feature hierarchy may viable alternative doctrine 
computing receptive feature detector redux notion feature detection figures theories natural computation quite different original concept developed influence discovery bug detectors frog retina 
important difference lies realization representational power ensemble feature detectors may far exceed constituents 
consider example problem specifying representation spatial discrimination tasks vernier acuity 
typical instance task human subjects routinely discriminate left right offsets abutting vertical line segments size offset smaller spacing photoreceptors fovea 
warrington favor reconstructive approach 
notion representation covariance may fall short supplying formal basis semantics mental representations insofar strive unreachable definition necessary sufficient conditions mental state represents thing discussion opposite see 
purpose important concept covariance lead intuition regarding possible alternative approach representation

early computational accounts hyperacuity phenomenon postulated visual input reconstructed precision certain stage cortical processing making possible determine sense offset smaller pixel size 
proponents program believe possibility implementing visual function interest feature detectors building blocks see ch 
main objection leveled marr op 
cit world just complex yield types analysis suggested feature detector idea 
statement challenged years ago 
regarding hyperacuity particular known activity pattern set overlapping receptive fields cover vernier stimulus represents information necessary determining direction offset allowing reconstruction 
example consider perception coherent motion visual task intensively studied levels including neurobiological implementation 
middle temporal mt cortical area monkey find cells receptive fields tuned coherent motion particular direction 
ensemble activities cells may regarded representing motion visual field seen animal distributed non sense defined 
ability experimenters bias perceptual decision monkey electrical stimulation single mt cells indicates far monkey concerned activity mt cell constitutes representation stimulus motion philosophical perspective issue see 
activity mt cell occurs certain defined motion visual field artificial stimulation cell causes behavioral response similar real moving stimulus cell firing practical purposes represents motion event far monkey concerned 
visual motion hardly considered reconstructed activity mt cell 
clear pattern activity ensemble mt cells cells areas precede mt pathway need carry reconstruction 
higher stages visual processing object recognition computational need reconstruction appears equally questionable evidence involvement reconstructed representations equally controversial spatial discrimination motion tasks 
face recognition example error rate database hundreds images sixteen people taken varying illumination viewing conditions achieved system collections randomly situated receptive field activities features representing individual faces 
better error rate data set demonstrated system feature extraction done sophisticated statistical dimensionality reduction method 
neurobiology hypothesis faces represented inferotemporal cortex primate brain ensemble activities face detectors put forward repeatedly past years reviews see see 
studies reveal cortex monkey orderly columnar organization receptive fields selectively responding various complex aspects stimulus 
newly developed computational framework multivariate function approximation may help understand combination activities receptive fields support recognition high level functions bypassing need reconstructing world brain 
evidence series psychophysical experiments object recognition humans compatible framework 
paradigmatic approach vision visual system reconstruct world internally extract resulting representation fea tures necessary task hand 
developments computational vision visual neuroscience show features needed tasks ranging spatial dis object recognition extracted image directly gibson hypothesis direct perception 
emerging synthesis gibson position marr representation necessarily reconstruction plays central role
