slightly different approach advise users easy productive strategies selecting training examples 
effective approach provide small number highly rated examples presumably easy users generate running system generate initial recommendations reviewing top recommendations obviously bad items providing low ratings examples retraining system obtain new recommendations 
intend conduct experiments existing data sets evaluating strategies selecting training examples 
providing learning system prior knowledge target concept effective way improving learning small samples 
biasing learning existing knowledge inductively revising existing knowledge base shown improve accuracy range real world problems 
libra current bayesian learner biased initial knowledge providing priors conditional probabilities jc bias corresponding estimates computed data 
user willing provide initial information authors subjects general keywords known interest mapped priors relevant parameters 
approach successfully applied web page recommendation 
utilizing richer representations language content unordered bags words weak frequently effective representation content 
plan explore richer representations ability improve recommendation performance 
specifically examine phrases syntactic parsing lexical semantic information wordnet enrich set features describe items 
integrating content collaborative methods studying additional ways combining content collaborative recommending particularly important 
collaborative content libra useful significant data bases user ratings item content available sources information contribute better recommendations 
approach similar introduced include representation book additional slots names users liked names users 
making slot bag number times user name appears depends strength weakness rating existing learning algorithm allowed exploit sign magnitude users opinions 
utilizing additional sources book information expanding libra exploit book information available amazon area research 
step direction constructing routines extract book information similar sources line borders online library catalogs 
somewhat ambitious task extracting book information structured sources 
example system query general web search engines altavista yahoo author title known book attempt extract useful information item resulting web pages newsgroup postings retrieved 
currently considered recommendations abstracts short descriptions books 
eventual goal serve recommendation service digital libraries complete text available electronic form 
time complexity underlying algorithms linear feasible scale system complete text feature selection required reduce size book descriptions maintain reasonable memory cpu requirements
