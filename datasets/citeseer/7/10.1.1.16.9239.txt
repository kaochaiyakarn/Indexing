approaches discussed section iii 
main extensions required model 
firstly need investigate setting learning rate markets abrupt changes supply demand 
hypothesis agents learning rate rapidly respond market changes perform best 
secondly fl strategy tested single unit protocol rules parameters reasoning model may need modi ed deal multiple unit case 
thirdly wish experiment fuzzy logic controllers conventional mamdani controller 
reason may case type controller improve performance algorithms 
fourthly need develop tools assist users adjusting parameters fuzzy rules preferences 
needed reasoning model widely accessible usable
