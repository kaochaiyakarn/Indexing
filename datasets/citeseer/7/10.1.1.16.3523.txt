user actions violate steps plan new actions taken alter threatening action longer threatens plan replan change narrative reflect user action 
communication ends pipeline occurs socket connection 
proposed implementation film system allow view cinematic display narrative unfolds 
camera control architecture film system defined pipeline objects narrative planner 
planner generates information conveyed user scene typically actions carried characters actions consequences 
information passed domain specific translator able map action descriptors terms module director understand 
director uses translated scene requirements select specific film idiom predefined scene tree 
binds unbound variables chosen scene objects virtual world 
scene specification passed graphics engine specific cinematographer 
cinematographer takes constraints define individual shots scene chooses best camera position world satisfy constraints described 
scene tree scene tree encodes knowledge film idioms needed construct appropriate camera placements storytelling experience 
scenes encoded film language expressive cover wide variety idioms 
scene certain components allow heuristically searched director selecting shot 
tree constructed levels 
root generic shot followed level differentiated shot type 
levels differentiated number participants emotional effect shot keyword list finest shot selection 
subsequent level tree contains scene refined conveys information user 
property allows quick searches tree 
keyword match eliminate node siblings search children 
node ranked children means children scenes provide information world information required fulfill objectives 
case err side caution choose scene meets objectives objectives 
children nodes may add information confuse user 
instance objective show conversation shot people necessary show emotional intent shot specified 
choose children scene may show angry conversation confusing unnatural 
child node fulfills objectives child node selected 
film language film language designed expressive characterize camera behaviors film idiom flexible dynamically adapt shot world geometry 
basic units film idiom specification scene shot 
objects film specification represent analogous concepts cinema 
scene contains subject information shot list 
shot list specified certain required primitives constraints proper positioning camera 
example simple scene follows 
scene actor moving direction filmed center shot unspecified period time 
time elapses camera position fixed actor walks 
name movement scene type movement number participants emotional effect neutral keyword description shot list name tracking cut time basis actor constraints normal lens weight lookat actor weight actor long shot weight actor long shot weight name exit cut time basis actor constraints weight weight weight example lines prior shot list describe requisite information place scene scene tree correctly 
shot list defines sequence shots scene 
shot text name variables cut basis constraints 
cut defines event causes cinematographer move shot list 
example events simple duration complicated events constructed allowing flexibility idiom specification 
basis vector indicating positive axes shot 
basis allows frame defining camera location direction relative principle subjects scene 
final component shot sequence constraints restrict instantiation shot 
constraint consists function arguments 
arguments explicitly specified normal lens unbound variables indicated form type lookat actor 
constraint weight indicating relative importance shot constraints appropriately relaxed constraints satisfied simultaneously 
translator information output narrative planner formatted director object translator mediates planner director 
translator contains certain domain specific information recast input format allows director select scenes formulate bindings variables 
translator essentially mapping planner operators director input structure allowing director domain independent 
director traditional film production director responsible decision making process 
ensures narrative conveyed effectively film techniques disposal 
film system director similar role 
director object takes translated input determines scene specified scene tree best fits specification 
director requires certain information translator type scene number participants emotional affective context story current point telling 
information director performs depth search backtracking select best scene scene tree 
search method works assumption tree construction specifies level tree contains critical information scene specification lower levels tree 
scene selected director binds unbound variables scene specification passes information cinematographer 
unbound variables may time constants locations rotations actors props world 
cinematographer director specified scene constraints effect filming scene cinematographer job choose optimal position camera 
cinematographer uses constraints passed director select optimal placement camera selected optimal position may may valid position virtual environment 
possible reasons optimal position invalid shot may occluded object world pair constraints may easily satisfied tandem 
case relax constraints optimal point determine closest point best satisfy constraints 
constraints relaxed weights defined scene specification 
currently employ ad hoc procedural model relaxation constraints 
model define relaxation particular constraint types predefined procedures 
relaxation location constraint instance implemented function moves camera orbit xy plane changes magnitude camera distance target
