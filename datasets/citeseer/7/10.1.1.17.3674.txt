main sources workspace awareness information face face collaboration corresponding mechanisms people gather 
people obtain information produced people bodies workspace workspace artifacts conversations gestures 
mechanisms gather called consequential communication feedthrough intentional communication 
conversation gesture intentional communication primary source information ubiquitous collaboration conversation gesture mechanism intentional communication clark heath luff 
verbal conversations prevalent form communication groups ways awareness information picked verbal exchanges 
people may explicitly talk awareness elements partners simply state working doing 
explicit communication may involve gestures visual actions short williams christie 
second people gather awareness information overhearing conversations 
conversation people may explicitly include third person understood exchange public information pick 
example hutchins described navigation teams navy ships talk open circuit allowing hear conversations greatly adding team resiliency changing environments 
third people pick verbal shadowing running commentary people commonly produce alongside actions spoken particular 
heath luff observed behaviour call note thought relatively potentially interrupting activities undertaken room obtrusive informing particular persons 
bodies consequential communication important sources awareness information real world collaboration team members bodies workspace

third full fidelity video entire upper body show arms hands faces ishii providing gaze awareness information allowing eye contact 
example ishii clearboard system ishii illustrated gives impression working remote collaborator pane glass 

clearboard showing video image remote user ishii expressive artifacts information produced workspace artifacts feedthrough primary ways people maintain workspace awareness 
computational workspaces interaction idioms techniques manipulating artifacts obscure people actions reducing feedthrough compromising awareness 
physical world interaction computational environments limited direct manipulation 
symbolic manipulation techniques commands users specify actions powerful flexible ways 
shortcuts buttons toolbars key commands emphasize rapid invocation execution 
idea single user systems symbolic manipulation produces minimal feedback minimal feedthrough reducing people ability maintain awareness 
leads drawbacks team members trying stay aware 
symbolic actions little visible representation workspace actions harder see workspace go unnoticed 
second symbolic actions performed similar ways difficult distinguish 
third symbolic actions happen instantaneously allowing little time see interpret 
problems addressed transforming minimal information provided actions visible form feedthrough 
approach making artifacts expressive segal suggests compensate consequential information lost providing enhanced feedback system indicating specific actions operator performing 
discuss approaches process feedthrough action indicators actions obvious distinguishable interpretable 
process feedthrough symbolic commands invoked interface widgets buttons menus dialog boxes 
feedback provided command objects seen members distributed team considered part application part workspace second considered distracting users 
feedback interfaces help group determine actions people composing 
people receive information process feedthrough 
simple example process feedthrough consider button interface groupware application 
person cursor moves button highlighted users screens person presses button shown pressed screens 
highlight press give people chance interpret action determine person doing 
button represents particularly important action natural feedthrough augmented visible 
example button clicking sound pressed obvious highlight colour enhance action 
carl presses button saul view 
action information button press greenberg gutwin roseman 
second example involves process feedthrough menus 
menus complicated case buttons carry greater risk distracting obscuring 
reduce risk display portion feedback information visible local user 
shows popup menu appears local remote display 
technique useful large menu hide local user view 

popup menu seen locally left remotely right 
providing process feedthrough shows actions composed invoked action noticeable 
actions hard see augmented artificial indicators approach discuss 
action indicators animations symbolic actions happen quickly abruptly making hard see hard interpret 
example presses delete key remove selected object operation nearly instantaneous 
actions invisible approach create artificial signal signals called action indicators perceivable workspace representation 
example delete operation obvious ways 
simple solution draw text notification near object remote screens removing object 
technique gives rest group information time interpret sudden disappearance object 
sophisticated solution artifact animate action 
actions cause visible change artifact changes perceptible action invisible 
shows approach concept map system 
object labeled node deleted simply disappear moment gradually fading away supernova effect
