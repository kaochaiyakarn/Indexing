sensory honesty fundamental issues perception character able perceive complexity characters brains increased increasingly useful treat mechanisms perception principled manner 
entails attempt realism terms things character perceive visual events occur wall perceived perceives locations visual events passed character character world coordinates character access

fundamental aspect sensory honesty forces separation actual state world particular character view state world 
obvious reason character perception cover small part world state black white creatures example see events take place 
keeping separate state world character beliefs state open door representations occasionally diverge 
forces character intelligent assumptions aspects directly observe

see burke description sheep dog acoustic pattern matcher operates principle hierarchical clustering technique 
priming priming corresponds roughly incorporation high level expectation information lowlevel recognition process 
expectations cause perception forgiving ambiguity certain strongly anticipated sensory experiences resulting priori biases certain data classifications 
example certain utterance repeated new utterance normally vague classify taken new instance utterance 
note converse phenomenon acceptable perceptual categories long take longer function just take slightly longer recognize friend seen years expect see recognize friend see day 
important lesson expectations emotions strongly influence perceptual experience character 
paranoid character jumps fright slightest motion character love momentarily mistakes woman passes object 
priming interesting phenomenon explore character ai systems precisely requires behavioral emotional infrastructure machine learning system provide 
notable feedback channels related effect leads long term perceptual adaptation second form short term perceptual adaptation

learning episodic memory forms memory see overview 
procedural memory allows practice improve specific skills time 
short term memory perceptual history world working memory slightly higher level history objects relevant current task behavioral context 
colloquial word memory refers long term episodic memory explicit sequences events stored conscious recall 
memories detail archetypal event sequences outcomes inform subsequent similar experiences 
course definition learning 
behavior simulation systems date explicit episodic memory learning mechanism 
learning episodic memory considered variant observation rule inference section anticipation imagination 
simply keeping statistical models causes effects cause effect probabilities episodic memory mechanism keep specific example episodes 
episodes exemplary event sequences predict sequences similar starting condi tions 
time button pushed elevator doors opened time door opened pushing button way 
advantage type learning speed useable hypotheses causality formed just observation 
furthermore causality models formed accompanied specific remembered instances hypothesis succeeded failed providing pool data support generalization discrimination cause effect models 
number issues quickly arise consider episode learning mechanism episodes recognized
