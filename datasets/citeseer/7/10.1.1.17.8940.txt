frequent sets obtained incremental algorithms explore possible key word subsets starting frequent singletons fwg fwg oeg iteratively adding key words produce new frequent sets

mining prototypical documents direction research automated information extraction apply knowledge discovery techniques complete textual content documents called full text approach opposed approaches considering indexing key words
