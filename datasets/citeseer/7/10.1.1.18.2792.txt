consider relatively complicated example starting situation illus schematically 
situation penguin played pengi wants kill enemy bee kicking ice cube 
ice cubes kicked slide dimensional game board vertical horizontal direction

penguin goes ice cube labeled projectile cube kicks right collide ice cube labeled cube come halt

executive plan verify plan continued applicability checking long list conditions arisen invalidate bee wander away bee draw close need dealt bee kick ice cubes disturb configuration way carrying plan impossible 
projectile cube cube penguin enemy bee 
situation requires looking ahead 
pengi constructs plans models hypothetical worlds 
take probable circumstances account place simulation pengi uses visualization 
peng looks see happen 
engages visual routines find particular spatial configurations predict courses events suggest actions 
example pengi sees ice cube adjacent penguin aligned bee intervening ice cubes kicks making strike kill bee

ice cubes aligned complex configuration obtains pengi sends penguin cui order kick cube

pengi regularly aborts routine contingency arises tries action repeatedly works notices promising option new routine opportunity arises interleaves different routines combines repertoire activities useful ways didn anticipate
