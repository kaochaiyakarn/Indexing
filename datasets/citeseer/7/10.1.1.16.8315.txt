number systems provide mobile technological services tourists lancaster guide system submitted cscw wap pda systems impact developments lessened limited understanding tourist practice 
understanding tourist practice possibility discovering new mobile applications key group mobile users 
results study focus key observations regarding tourist practice 
observation tourism inherently collaborative collaboration better supported technologically 
tourism predominantly social tourists travel family 
statistics show leisure visits involve groups 
leisure travel predominantly considerable intra group interaction collaboration 
presents opportunities demands design opportunities technologies explicitly support ordination activities 
second key finding study tourists number information resources maps guidebooks tourist information centres find places visit 
job tourist information transforming activity finding information 
involves comparing combining transforming diverse information 
technology support finding information tourists 
presents number opportunities technologies improve existing information resources attempting information amenable translation activity 
relevance tourism cscw tourists interesting group cscw just collaboration high mobility 
tourists defined mobility 
access conventional technologies internet telephone problematic tourists potential users mobile technologies location services 
travel tourism successful areas web technologies significant proportion travel booked internet wide range information maps available web sites 
internet mainly done home visits 
tourists access internet travelling generally restricted internet caf mobile technologies develop access online services move viable tourists ideal market new online services 
particular interest cscw potential services supporting mobile collaboration 
current generation technologies offered tourists mismatches practice 
example street map programs available pdas microsoft pocket streets face acute problem screen size 
ways programs hide street names limited functions quickly zooming map orientation problematic users 
studying problems tourists encounter design applications appropriately address tourists problems needs 
studying tourism presents opportunity experiment methods workplace studies applicability new contexts 
looking tourism allows start exploring leisure activities cscw particularly sociality leisure 
growth online video gaming shows leisure technologies take new life designed group social contact 
presents opportunities cscw research understanding technology support existing social bonds solely instrumental social connections 
literature tourism activity great importance economically pleasure gives worldwide 
nearly individuals western world take sort holiday away usual home year number days differs different countries 
tourism activity divides rich poor negative effect damages places 
expect large body literature explores issues various perspectives economic cultural environmental importance 
large body obvious issue cscw offer 
previous tourism studies noted insufficient attention paid experience practices tourist effects tourism 
murray comment detailed knowledge basis actual tourist behaviour lacking argues tourism research help explain nature modern mass tourism 
looked detail tourist practice tourist information seeking literature 
literature tended avoid detailed qualitative description focusing broad categorisation tourist practice questionnaire studies 
purposes lack detailed observations presents number problems design technologies 
specifically lack understanding methods tourists choose arrange various activities 
motivated choice workplace studies method focusing tourists arrange activities depth effects tourism traditional 
doing similar approaches studying museum visitors interactions local people tourists tourist information centres 
focus ordinary activities looking shared museum exhibit leads findings useful design technologies 
method study embedded video possible observational 
small cameras video tape activities participants observers 
collected main sections qualitative data 
spent days observing tourists edinburgh glasgow combining observation activities 
focus documents tourists maps guidebooks train timetables 
observations conducted major train stations luxury hotels glasgow main city square edinburgh historic royal mile major tourist areas 
combined observations video diaries taken accompanying tourists day city 
supplemented observations twelve interviews tourists tape recorded transcribed 
lastly conducted day quick dirty ethnography glasgow tourist information centre collecting data activities staff tourists asking information edinburgh glasgow second third popular cities tourists visit london 
summer edinburgh glasgow particularly busiest time year cities edinburgh festival better weather major tourist attraction 
influenced type tourists 
tourists spoke studied predominantly independent travellers arranged travel assistance travel agency 
package tours market obviously important part tourism case leisure visitors focus tourists arrange activities group acutely suffers problems organisation 
major part independent travellers young people travelling prolonged period time entering paid employment independent travellers diverse group wide age range 
case encompasses older travellers called peter pan travellers city breaks travellers specific sporting interest case scotland prominently golf 
diverse range data analysis suffered taken approach 
additional source data experiences tourists time conducted study 
collect data systematically sources field notes taken tourist trips authors 
combined video data observations generate differing understandings activity 
analysis combined ethnographic approach analysing data understanding detailed interactional analysis looked moment moment interactions tourists 
example analysing video trip bus tour looked gaze behaviour tourists bus travelled city 
interested find video tourists travelled bus bus tour fitted visits 
results key aspect tourism focused productive enjoyable 
enjoyment takes forms significant aspects mentioned tourists interviewed social nature tourism tourism connection learning exploring 
tourism similarities learning 
typical tourist activities going museums feature learning key component 
going new place involves learning place limited form learning get things located 
places different learning differences surely motivations traveller 
tourists interviewed talked wanting get flavour place learn attractions history 
tourists key problem organise enjoyment 
local person guide organisation involves considerable effort 
decide sites visit determine decide go 
booking accommodation example involves balancing hotel location transport links cost availability quality prior visit 
arrangement strong temporal elements 
tourist want spend time arranging things desire spend time activity preparing activity 
working solve problems number issues tourists attend 
set issues discuss concerns collaboration tourists 
tourists visit groups organising enjoyment ordinating activities 
ordination extends companions tourists local people 
meeting attractions holiday 
third form collaboration tourists organisations providing facilities tourists travel providers 
tourists need orient structures provided cities timetables descriptions guided tours decide 
working videos see task organising involves number subtle contingencies 
shows frames taken video tourists just arrived edinburgh main train station 
tourist holds street guide edinburgh looking 
second tourist glances railway station 
tourist finds correct page second tourist takes glasses look map glances map points exit sign train station names street exit leads 
give street guide look pick bags leave station 
simple excerpt see division labour tourists 
second tourist looks station find exit tourist tries find correct page map 
holds map map progress available companion 
finding station describes location station friend friend adds name street reached vie exit items information know map exit take proceed destination 
tourists train station reading map done way checked tourist companion 
mistake easy find lost companion intervene 
job remembering route shared tourists 
addition environment move map course activity 
sign station link map station exit leads 
artefact map supports micro mobility fits seamlessly interactional task 
case map easily shared tourists 
collaboration takes place map items referenced talk simply pointing map 
worth underlining handheld systems support similar micro mobility useful tourists maps books 
example simple act pointing screen pda map programs changes view map 
pointing common interactional meaning interfere dramatically attempts tourists routes 
collaborative working going implicit negotiation 
tourists deciding going 
incidents observed explicit interaction mixed conversation 
particular exhibit appeal tourist queue attraction increase time spent causing problems 
directly involved conversation wishes felt children example trip don want see difficult 
tourists need collectively negotiate contingencies coming decision 
say judgements problematic moment moment basis simply suggesting activity watching reaction say decision making process simple 
ordination groups visiting involves explicit ordination distance 
desire visit different sites simply see different museum exhibits means group splits needs ordinate meeting 
considerable challenges tourists highly mobile 
situations mobile phones useful tool calls individuals sub groups local form ordination problem takes place particular sites individuals go different rooms different exhibits need locate travelling companions 
particularly case tourists children children run carefully watched see come harm 
trivial activity managing tracking movement children full time activity 
incidents observed mothers spent considerable time shepherding children museums particular collecting children leaving 
addressing problems technologically involve designing technology enable tourists explicitly communicate location 
example group splits choose tie locations 
handheld device subgroup able see map 
support groups split want lose track applications sites sites large museums 
mobile phone charging systems expensive calls possible cost high international calls connect call foreign mobile phones country 
information exchange tourists important part tourist potential meet new people local people tourists alike 
standard jokes holiday displays meeting people integral part tourist experiences 
part opportunities come lowered barriers social contact 
individuals holiday home commitments 
facilities tourists trains buses afford social contact 
reason social contacts certainly common conversation topic exchange stories advice go visit 
interviews advice great value greater information guidebooks tourist information staff 
word mouth sharing allows tourists exchange information sites changed informal information different places facilities friendliness 
meetings conversations just forums exchange information 
exchange information provides ticket talk tourists excuse topic conversation 
social contact conversations initiate may value exchange information 
technologies attempt expand support extent exchanging tourist gossip stories platform establishing social bonds albeit temporarily simply enjoying new people 
working establishments guided tour third form collaboration involves tourists directly country town visiting 
job tourist orientation organisations operating times location relative quality 
tourists orient organisations planning structuring activity 
geography roles location transportation comes major importance 
way geography intersects characteristics different establishments turning searching multivariate problem considerable complexity 
time important factor opening times ordinated times public transport trains buses 
compounded pre booking problem 
facilities require pre booking book 
decisions difficult place account contingencies arise holiday 
desire flexible contingencies change want spend longer particular place conflicts need 
solving problem involves making trade desired facilities flexibility 
partial solution package holiday 
package holidays time structured activities choosing restaurant involve orienting incorporating structures provided organisations 
tools tourists structure provided tours guides 
take example tourist bus tour 
edinburgh glasgow particularly popular different companies competing passengers charging trip 
see group tourists edinburgh bus tour 
tourists right site new scottish parliament 
date commentary provided headphones mention site tourists large signs explaining building 
tourists integrate structure guided tour changing city linking structures organisations provide details environment social interactions 
blindly adopt view tour guide integrate structure provides view plans changing city 
tour bus edinburgh passenger observed tour bus drew line map bus travelled city letting record recollection helping link different sights 
bus tours role organising device city visit providing information key streets attractions allowing visit leisure 
tours provide information structure city plans follow activities 
pre organised tours suggests technology offer similar flexible tours city revealing passively obtained information tourists routes visited places 
expect tourists blindly follow electronic tours tours flexibly help organise enjoyment 
electronic tours turn designed support ignore flexibility 
information resources second set findings study concerns ways tourists extensive number information resources maps guidebooks tourist information centres organising enjoyment 
obviously needs find information place plan 
job resources information transforming activity finding information 
information integrated information help tourists decisions take actions information generally 
maps creative wayfinding seen common resources tourists maps 
maps course researched artefact fields widespread cognitive psychology cultural studies 
specifically topic way finding explored depth 
finding studies map users significantly better tasks involve configuration information far landmark maps better local people years knowledge place 
surprisingly little examined situ naturalistic non staged maps 
looking data map shows differences notion maps straightforward wayfinding tool 
maps simply followed route guide point point rough guides action 
tourists know exactly going may just idea particular area heading believe chance find interesting 
turn looking specific caf specific caf mind 
lastly tourists may rough idea map locate orient head roughly correct direction 
map know little idea orientation know going unsure looking 
extreme situation maps help 
landmarks names streets cross name street tourists determine location sort approximation 
finding orientation harder done finding landmark street name streets parallel 
classic wayfinding methods allow maps find means reaching interesting places combination sort idea different areas example guide book 
maps discover local amenities 
frequent visitor know effective ways find restaurant unfamiliar city simply wander central area 
means perfect way finding particular amenities walking exploits tendency certain facilities bars restaurants clustered particular areas way tendency smaller denser cities manhattan los angeles 
judge establishments appearance menu walk past 
disadvantage waste considerable time going different establishments 
reason visitors maps guidebooks look clusters facilities 
means going establishment example restaurant long restaurants nearby go problems 
importantly maps just wayfinding 
observed tourist waiting get train glasgow train station 
tourist spent minutes reading map west way popular walk accessible trains station 
looking map tourist walk learning planning walk map 
explicitly finding way learning things help walk 
form reading maps commonplace observations people spent long periods time looking maps 
aspect form map reading simply pass time observed commonly trains buses 
passing time practical way helping tourist familiar place prevent getting lost 
points neglected aspect maps pedagogical function 
major aim map learn place sufficiently get map 
map just wayfinding pre visiting learning place looking streets go names streets potential landmarks 
especially maps situ process travelling learn sites streets way return idea location get different places 
learning places important aspect maps 
technologically just support wayfinding neglect crucial function 
maps provide overview allow fit observations travelling 
data tourists maps shows maps considerable source confusion city visitors 
map general problem 
move description map activity 
simple case map reading involves considerable interpretation moves city 
reading map specific place complex balancing linking concrete relations streets places symbolic spatial representation map 
example staff tourist information office give directions combine different ways giving directions 
set directions drawing line map portable version tourist point map find destination 
maps hard people particularly know city 
staff combine map showing physical space destination get argyle street 
terms technology observations clear presenting map system pda complex task just displaying maps 
pdas need support relevant tasks finding needs quick access detailed lists streets finding suitable establishments easily moving flat map activity issues return 
giving directions guidebooks managing geography second publication guidebook 
giving general information places transport information recommended hotels restaurants attractions guidebooks support range tourist activities 
guidebooks contain phone numbers support advance booking choice amenities collected place 
way guidebooks useful companion maps contribute detailed information combined geographical information provided maps 
combine geographical information facilities characteristics

going restaurant possibility prove unsuitable fully booked safer pick area potential restaurant minimise travel time 
course turn presents problem writers guidebooks list restaurants characteristics quality price area cuisine focus location 
different categorisations useful different times different combinations 
key aspect guidebooks moving characteristic geography attempting combine arranging 
highlights potential advantage electronic guidebooks easily combine information categories 
deal geography sensibly simply establishment geographical area cause problems particularly edges area 
turn advantage guidebooks afford particularly useful interaction method 
user place fingers pages multiple points book open book particular page 
trivial operation supports jumping different pages compare combine information fingers acting bookmarks 
important tourists comparison combination combining information maps descriptions 
bookmarking common interaction technique books guides 
map separate guidebook map guidebook arranged visual field time 
interesting note pocketpc web browser displays web page time failing support basic operations making hard tourists able combine information find different web pages 
tourist information centres moving representation action finish discussion different resources tourists briefly discussing tourist information centres tics cities studied 
particular interest tic value visitors get guidebooks maps 
main functions tic provide information visitors local people form addresses maps publications phone numbers 
crucially tic just forum passing information 
job staff tic helping visitors go particular representations maps guidebook decision going 
decision making involves general information provided publications finding relevant tourist 
example staff combine range information arrive suggestion accommodation 
staff tic know accommodation city fairly recommendations visitors able 
example called euro suitable form accommodation elderly woman 
single rooms attracts wider range ages expect 
elderly woman particularly tight budget staff may suggest euro place stay 
factor impacts accommodation cost taxis 
able say particular distance taxi ride tic staff need know route taken taxi prices traffic flows different times day 
prices taxis availability affect practical accommodation
