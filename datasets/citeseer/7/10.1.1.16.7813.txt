briefly summarize dai approaches drawn different metaphors conclude overview social metaphors played role dai 
complete surveys approaches bond gasser decker durfee lesser corkill organizations involved variety human organizations familiar powerful metaphor dai draw formal informal notions organizations fox hewitt 
organizational perspective ai agent group plays particular organizational role roles defined assigned appropriately group coherent team 
simple example organization gasser gasser considers pursuit problem predators pursue surround prey grid 
predators identify organizational roles corresponding occupying location region different side prey 
assigning roles appropriately concert surround capture prey 
challenge agents settle questions roles filled fill gasser views formation organizations settled unsettled problems belief action agents view agents 
pursuit problem benda stephens merx focussed alternative organizations predators assigning responsibilities 
complicated task domains require organizations assign roles agents sufficient flexibility adapt changing task demands 
agent working organization needs sophisticated local decisionmaking capabilities order determine possible activities perform enhance collective effort 
coupling organizational structures sophisticated local control studied corkill lesser corkill lesser corkill provide agents jointly known organizational structures specify general set long term responsibilities interaction patterns 
organization helps agents generate selectively share information importance group 
time agents overly constrained general organizational structures remain reactive opportunistic situation faces evolves 
specific organizational structure suited certain demands coordination ineffective demands 
ongoing challenge characterize attributes situations organizations able prescribe organizational structure classification current situation malone knowledge agents redesign organization meet needs new situations ishida 
plans planning primary concern ai years surprising ai researchers viewed problem coordination problem planning multiple ai agents 
perspective resulted techniques strengths weaknesses planning paradigms 
fairly predictable application domains ai planning paradigms search different orderings plan steps provide powerful means ensuring goals achieved 
assurances important multiagent domains 
example air traffic control fully predicting resolving interactions collisions action better flying seat pants 
plans generally viewed programs executed agre chapman lock agents course action things evolve 
planning possible interactions computationally costly place great demands communication distributed system 
ai research planning multiple agents classified main approaches 
centralized multiagent planning agents chosen agents cammarata human designer georgeff collects separate plans agents analyzes find potential conflicts 
resolves conflicts suggesting alterations plans inserting additional synchronization steps 
second main approach distributed multiagent planning corkill georgeff konolige agents model develop plans exchange information affect world order identify resolve conflicts 
schedules ai research scheduling predominantly focussed manufacturing concerns proper scheduling equipment manpower impacts throughput efficiency factory 
scheduling requires coordination resources physically functionally distinct researchers carnegie mellon investigated distributed approach scheduling sycara 
theme underlying scheduling constraints resources applied generated propagated generate suitable schedules 
consequence dai approaches scheduling generally resemble constraint satisfaction techniques modified allow knowledge communication constraints distributed 
distributed constraint satisfaction similarly core multistage negotiation protocol 
goal protocol schedule allocation communication network resources establish desired connections possible

partial global planning partial global planning durfee durfee lesser capitalizes strengths organizational planning contracting approaches uniting single hybrid framework 
goal framework get multiagent planning benefits detailed situation specific coordination excessive computation communication costs accomplished jointly known organizational structures effectively prune space possible plans keep problem tractable 
addition partial global planning views contracts jointly held plans specify exchanges tasks results agents 
partial global planning coordination involves sharing tasks sharing results adhering long term organizational roles tively planning achieve short term objectives 
partial global planning designed coordinate agents cooperatively solving problems durfee 
cooperative distributed problem solving agents solving subproblems problem share results converge solutions 
example partial global planning implemented tested context distributed sensor network application simulated distributed vehicle monitoring testbed lesser corkill 
shows example problem vehicle moves sensors attached separate agent sensor connected agent track vehicles sensed range share tracked information agents build map vehicle movements entire area 
agents coordinate problem solving activities order effective team 
data arrived coordination involve ffl assigning tasks agent resources receive data process sensor ffl getting agent focus processing data long vehicle track data upper left corner strongly sensed agents greater confidence correctness longer tracks ffl having agents assign data overlapping areas avoid redundant processing activity ffl having agent send agent partial track adjacent agent region early agent filter noisy data 
partial global planning agent represents anticipated problem solving activities problem solving plan 
vehicle monitoring example problem solving plan indicate data agent expects processing results anticipates forming result

distributed vehicle monitoring example 
receives information determines local plans pursue related results combines received information summary relevant local plan larger global plan 
representation change time information arrives reflect activities agent network called partial global plan 
partial global plan agent representation interleaved major plan steps participating agents 
view hypothesize better orderings allocations steps agents modify local plans accordingly 
example agents exchange summaries local plans separately builds partial global plan corresponding goal forming vehicle track spanning combined areas 
version partial global plan identify better orderings local activities agent changes plan generate send partial track agent help filter noisy data sooner 
agents initiate partial global planning voluntarily exchanging information highly rated plans send updated information local plans changed substantially 
agents independently asynchronously forming revising partial global plans converge identical views coordination due communication delays domain dynamics 
partial global planning helps coordinate satisfactorily cases gives local autonomy respond important local changes information durfee lesser 
extensive discussion agents partial global planning coordinate successfully scenario durfee lesser 
exchange plan information agents uncontrolled agents swamp communication channels unnecessary information 
partial global planning views coordination distributed problem solve right employs organizational approach control exchange plan information 
having domain level organizational structure specifies agents roles solving application problem agents common knowledge meta level organization specifies roles solving coordination problems 
agents participating multiple organizations time 
ability agents participate concurrently multiple organizations allows interesting parallels human societies enterprises 
meta level organization essentially dictates management control structure agents principal contributions coordinating ongoing activities 
domain level organization controls flow results enterprise 
meta level domain level organizations generally high degree correspondence professor integrates results directs research students times decoupled facilities manager ensures resources maintained utilized necessarily knowing resources producing 
proper choice organizational structures strongly impact overhead quality coordination enterprise commonly known organizational theorists experiments partial global planning provide additional verification intuition 
particular number agents increases choices organizational structures strongly impact combinatorics coordination 
experimented networks sensors agents 
details experiments durfee summarize findings 
employ agents domain level organization lateral agent combine results agent network agents connected sensors form local track hypotheses send eleventh agent integrates hypotheses 
meta level organizations initially considered lateral centralized organizations 
quickly discovered overhead lateral organization extremely high agent collecting reasoning plans agents order coordinate local plan 
regardless domain level organization lateral meta level organization allows agents locally responsive unexpected situations unilaterally change plans approval higher authority 
centralized meta level organization incurs overhead agent reasoning collective activity agents coordinate central manager quickly bottleneck reliability hazard 
cases central management needed capabilities single agent human organizations adopt hierarchical organization 
hierarchical meta level organization simulation realized intuitive phenomena expected 
example computational overhead hierarchical organization reduced middle managers coordinating fewer agents experiments middle managers coordinate agents sending coordinated agent partial global plans single top manager iron wrinkles plans 
representation top manager details agents activities coordination middle managers top manager search better coordination significantly simplified 
cost reduction overhead expected slower responsiveness individual agents wait permission change plans passed levels bureaucracy communication bureaucracy 
observations outlined partial global planning advantages predecessors including ability constrain generation plans organizational bounds coordinate plans improve collective performance institute alternative organizations domain meta levels balance competing needs including reducing communication reducing computation increasing reliability increasing responsiveness unexpected events 
partial global planning major limitations scale hierarchical organization alleviates certain scale difficulties way partial global planning represents collective activities union individual activities representing reasoning large number agents unwieldy 
organizational self design partial global planning developed organizational structures explicit modifiable decisions organization institute scenario left human experimenter agents 
turn issues overcoming limitations 
abstracting activities higher levels management need simplify representation organizational subunits 
example corporate president view composed small number entities divisions production design purchasing 
entity complicated multiagent system corporate president typically perform managerial duties knowing internal structure divisions 
corporate president coordinate divisions abstractions abstractions appropriate 
example abstraction indicating people division average pay useful deciding budget cuts useless comes shepherding new product pipeline 
complications abstracting collective activity crop partial global planning 
agent hierarchical organization example middle manager activities agents responsible abstraction top manager 
agent teams developing pieces track team abstracted highlight partial solutions forming different times top manager coordinate exchange partial solutions help teams form compatible pieces 
alternatively teams working independent solutions planning solution method involves common non sharable resource agent streamlined integrating partial results 
top manager coordinate teams access shared resources efficiently needs abstractions emphasize teams going achieving results results expect produce 
partial global planning led observe teams problem solving agents emphasize subproblem solutions forming emphasize forming solutions emphasize solving particular subproblems 
times needed team primary importance times information processing responsibility reside critical 
properly abstracting collective activities require amount exploration agents revise abstractions emphasize different attributes quality complexity coordination current choice attributes 
short abstractions collective behavior reduce communication computation hierarchical organizations intuitive solution flexibly constructing right abstractions far easy 
organizational self design partial global planning supports dynamic coordination problem solving plans agents facilities changing relatively static organizational structure 
result agent underutilized repeatedly partial global plans relocate particular tasks 
repeated coordination better chronic imbalance loads resolved revising common organizational structure portion tasks go agent responsibility agent 
fixing organization case cost effective continually repairing load imbalances due faulty organization 
impediment organizational self design partial global planning distinction plans dynamically generated exchanged modified organizations static assumed commonly known 
way viewing partial global planning approach means agents broadly defined organizational roles develop exchange information narrows role playing current situation 
perspective organization really 
really artifact hybrid approach taken partial global planning multiagent planning organizational structuring remain distinct despite united framework 
truly allow organizational self design agents able generate exchange modify organizational roles plans 
words plans organizations treated identically 
note collection interacting agents abstracts activities details lost 
example specifics partial results formed blurred leading view agents generating variety results extended time period 
time period gets longer fact representation collective activity looks plan organization 
individuals entire team associated general set expectations constitutes organizational role 
characterizations results produced extended time period represent agents collections agents expect team details team accomplishes results 
gradual transition plans organizations consequence abstraction proceed direction 
organization associated personnel processes products decomposed 
issues involved choosing appropriate attributes decomposition emphasize aspects collective activity analogous choosing appropriate attributes emphasize abstracting collective plans 
decomposing organization product hierarchy analogous reducing abstraction specializing attribute results different subgroups achieving 
hand decomposing organization functional hierarchy maps specializing attribute subgroups acting expertise resources applying tasks 
organizations decomposed emphasize spatial relationships coordinating distribution identical functional product capabilities temporal relationships transitioning new products functions response changing market demands corresponding attributes identified partial global planning 
specialization different dimensions proceeds representation activity begins resemble organization plan schedule 
precisely activity take place processes resources agents expected results activity transform representation detailed schedule 
common representation coordination observations hypothesize plans ai sense organizations management sense schedules operations research sense fact manifestations type entity 
call hypothesis common representation coordination hypothesis organizations plans schedules common representation differ degree specificity different descriptive dimensions 
ongoing call common representation behavior descriptive dimensions behavior gleaned experiences partial global planning include behavior trying achieve goals trying achieve result methods participating behavior participants behavior active time intervals behavioral activities place regions behavior motivations pursuing goals 
set dimensions preliminary proven useful starting point representing reasoning alternative forms coordination 
partial hierarchy computer dimensions form slots behavioral representation 
instances behaviors combined linked network behavior linked specialized behavioral instances 
simple example consider partial hierarchy behaviors shown 
long term level behavior represents organizational objective fictitious computer wants increase computer sales creating demand product interval time 
tracing downward hierarchy current plan achieving organizational objective new york subsidiary adopted increase number users product giving computers away satisfied users convince additional buyers 
tracing downward giving computers away subsidiary scheduled 
generating joint behavior behavior hierarchy represents composition decomposition enterprise terms time space goals means personnel motivation 
different parts enterprise different pieces hierarchy communication proper behavioral representation 
example new york boston computer want avoid competing communicating upcoming behaviors fairly level detect potential competition communicate details competition durfee montgomery 
boston subsidiary increasing demand investigate combination impact overlapping sales areas 
behavior hierarchy represents search space agents groups agents attempt find coordinated joint behaviors 
important note search space static 
consider example happens second called department store shares environment computer 
department store wants sell merchandise making shopping convenient 
companies communicate organizational objectives search potential joint activities generate behavior corresponding joint venture 
joint venture companies achieve separate objectives service customers shop home computers 
process coordination reduces search space possible joint behaviors 
applies equally coordination occurring organizational planning scheduling level 
hierarchical behavior space distributed different agents agents typically limited knowledge behaviors coordination amounts distributed search 
working formalizing unified theory coordination process coordination knowledge search hierarchical behavior space
