internet designed provide communications channel resistant denial service attacks human ingenuity 
note propose construction storage medium similar properties 
basic idea redundancy scattering techniques replicate data large set machines internet add anonymity mechanisms drive cost selective service denial attacks 
detailed design service interesting scientific problem merely academic service may vital safeguarding individual rights new threats posed spread electronic publishing 
gutenberg inheritance times knowledge guarded power gave 
bible controlled church encoded latin kept chained 
knowledge guarded craft secrecy restrict competition 
information leaked usually spread far significant effect 
example translated bible english movement started suppressed peasants 
development moveable type printing johannes zur laden zum gutenberg half fifteenth century changed game completely 
translated new testament means available spread word quickly suppress 
executed late copies printed 
books sparks led reformation 
just publication bible challenged abuses centuries religious monopoly spread technical know destroyed 
reformation growing competitive class led scientific industrial revolutions better standard living enjoyed earlier centuries 
conversely societies managed control information extent collapse soviet empire democratic liberal capitalism won argument 
got cryptology conference 
quite simply advance electronic publishing placed risk inheritance gutenberg 
just advancing technology fifteenth century harder control information advances late twentieth making easier 
clear court action involving church published material organisation prefer kept secret 
apparently included organisation available members advanced certain level organisation 
gutenberg publication trade secret irreversible owners cope best 
publication electronic form got court orders action copyright infringement primary site usa august 
went amsterdam internet service provider september filed assets grounds copyright information appeared subscriber home page 
move raid anonymous remailer finland find identity users 
saga continues 
parallel earlier religious history instructive 
bible came public domain printed distributed sheer number dispersed copies impossible judges gather burning 
publishing come mean placing copies electronic document servers worldwide owners servers coerced removing 
irrelevant coercion comes wealthy exploiting legal process political rulers control flow ideas 
net effect erosion inheritance gutenberg printing electronics document de published

insight came studying burglar alarm systems sense publication scenario physical location worldwide web site located rich man lawyers execute seizure order 
anonymous publication service realised practice 
eternity service draw main inspiration internet originally conceived provide communications capability survive global war 
possible build file store similarly resilient extreme threat scenarios 
firstly sketch high level functional specification store call eternity service eternity service simple 
say want store mb file years tariff say 
upload digital coin file proof identity formality needed 
get ack years file get anonymous file transfer 
copies file stored number servers round world 
internet service depend cooperation large number systems common element protocol head office coerced corrupted diversity ownership implementation provide resilience error attack 
net effect file posted eternity service deleted 
delete forced delete abuse process gun wife head 
external attacks expensive arranging things file survive physical destruction participating file servers malicious conspiracy system administrators quite 
servers dispersed jurisdictions service integral part internet successful attack expensive hopefully resources governments 
city stars arthur clarke relates machinery city protected wear tear eternity circuits omits engineering details 
detailed design utilise known principles fragmentation redundancy scattering 
start consider details consider threat model 
threat model high level threat governments ban service outright 
done governments marginalise service 
political arguments quite predictable 
governments object child persian spies service point enemies state telephones faxes email video medium invented 
software publishers afraid pirate publish latest release ask escrow facility lets judge offending matter destroyed object judge today destroy information contained personal advertisement published times cost pounds 
law tends lag technology decade hard get governments agree countries usa free speech 
effective worldwide ban 
local israeli agents put file containing statements prophet mohammed get eternity servers banned world 
led rejection internet provide effective attack countries ability develop effective attack eternity service australian government ban sex newsgroups effect campuses outr postings originate 
non legislative global attacks blocked technical means 
network flooding completely ruled expensive unreliable providing access points ensuring location individual files remains secret integrating service internet 
follows focus mechanisms necessary prevent selective service denials finer levels granularity 
imagine ignorant corrupt judge issued file deleted wish design system frustrate plaintiff efforts seize 
imagine military intelligence agency criminal prepared kidnapping murder order remove file system resist 
basic idea explore tradeoffs redundancy anonymity 
simple design simplest design eternity service mimic printed book 
pay servers worldwide retain copy file remember names randomly selected audit performance enforce contract destroy record 
user compelled authority erase file hand list servers copies held servers compelled destroy surviving copies scattered unknown locations round world 
soon user escapes jurisdiction court wishes recover file sends broadcast message requesting copies 
servers receiving send copy chain anonymous remailers 
protection mechanisms simple large number servers great jurisdictions give high degree resilience 
trap significant improvements obtained intelligent optimisation legal environment 
example server delete eternity files manual approval security officer logon procedure require declare free agent logon banner states access authorised conditions free 
order log commit uk computer misuse act 
courts countries compel people commit criminal 
refer protection measure trap 
useful applications ranging root logon general systems unlock decryption signature keys electronic mail encryption software pgp 
tamper proof hardware trap may block coercion abuse process kind countries consider traditional kinds coercion kidnapping 
order protect owner file direct coercion rule owner may delete file posted 
may turn attention system administrators need protect 
best done arrange things identifiable group people including system administrators delete identifiable file system 
simplest approach encapsulate trusted computing base hardware security modules banks protect personal identification numbers customers machines jdk 
course systems failed result design errors operational keys kept specially hardened silicon chips ways wealthy opponent attack bfl 
wide dispersal protection mechanisms may expensive opponent obtain break quorum tamper resistant devices short time window combination tamper resistance careful protocol design may sufficient 
case eternity service constructed follows 
hardware security server control number file servers 
file loaded system passed local security server share number security servers jurisdictions 
send encrypted copy file server jurisdiction 
client requests file local cache request go local security server contact remote ones chosen random copy control located 
copy decrypted encrypted requester public key shipped 
communications prevent attacker traffic analysis link encrypted plaintext files 
suitable mechanisms include mix nets networks anonymous remailers cha rings cha 
suitable sending file user communications security servers traffic analysis yield useful information file server contains copy file may facilitated traffic padding vn 
note existence secure hardware allows substantially reduce number copies file kept 
sufficient attacker longer locate copies file wishes destroy 
anonymity enables reduce diversity just burglar alarm example referred 
mathematics metal 
relying hardware tamper resistance may undesirable 
firstly relative time secondly export controls slow spread system thirdly special purpose low volume hardware expensive 
case security properties provided mathematics metal 
mathematics build eternity service 
protecting location file copies means location information inaccessible individual user subset users 
goal techniques threshold decryption byzantine fault tolerance implemented rampart rei 
byzantine fault tolerance means example copies data resist conspiracy bad accidental destruction systems complete recovery 
byzantine mechanisms incomplete recovery possible destruction systems guarantee integrity recovery bad sysadmin bogus data 
interesting interactions cryptography 
files signed system key full recovery long just surviving true copy file system public key subverted 
course rare get hard compromise signing key feasible recover compromise 
need provide service upgrades cryptographic mechanisms progress cryptanalysis computer engineering may force adoption new signature schemes longer existing ones 
need recover compromise key system 
users may want cryptography add privacy properties files 
order prevent number attacks selective service denial retrieve time complications resilient management authentication eternity service identify users 
provide confidentiality users encrypt data wish able 
course users select encryption schemes weak vulnerable time may hoped governments ill disposed service 
indexing system directory file 
users left remember file names opponent deny service preventing people know name revealing 
directory probably contain just file logical name relevant security servers understand labels plaintext name keyword list order allow retrieval people able retain machine readable information 
current directory cached locally popular files eternity service may delivered local gateway servers 
may occasionally purchased servers just university sites censor newsgroups alt sex namespace users able ftp data overseas gateways 
ultimately aim seamless integration rest internet 
payment eternity service may quickly rest internet storage costs money paid locally academic network costs paid centrally 
adapt digital cash generate electronic follows data 
provided mechanics got right economics get better time fileserver owners cost disk space keeps dropping geometrically keep getting mb year old files 
motivate server owners guard files copy new media current technology obsolete 
confidentiality properties needed electronic straightforward 
example may want banks want opponent lawyers bankers 
probably need doubly anonymous client vis vis bank bank vis vis network 
square audit accountability preventing money laundering 
bent judge orders banks delay payment long allegedly file flushed 
requirements tackled digital cash researchers 
problem arise service profitable 
presumably market revenue generating eternity servers fileserver owner wishes cash retire sell revenue generating files highest bidder 
obvious risk wealthy opponent buy servers significant chance obtaining copies target file 
secondary risk single network service provider acquire market share penetrate anonymity communications track copies 
risks controlled 
try certify server owners central body responsible certifying site nsa site bought coerced certification distributed individuals resources investigate server owners thoroughly 
alternative leave security policy user uploads file say want copies file moved randomly sites 
problem prevent policy erosion sites replaced time 
mundane level need mechanisms file server owner cheating claiming payments file keeping copy time 
just download file eternity service needs demonstrate possession 
provides reason files encrypted keys server owners know payment server pose challenge calculate mac file key check really kept data paid keep 
time complications need able trust time opponent manipulate network time protocol say date ad bring general file deletion 
bring network time protocol global positioning system department defense security perimeter create secure time service 
mechanics service discussed contexts really secure clock internet 
dependable time service benefit applications currency exchange transactions conducted merchant premises bank offline 
plan rely wide dispersal plus extra rules assets may deleted sysadmin confirms date date deletion purposes may exceed creation date system software years file may deleted payments received 
eternity service proposed outline may important guaranteeing individual liberties abuses power 
interesting scientific point view purpose cryptology computer security communities interesting problem merits study 
building eternity service force clarify number points nature secure time limits resilience distributed authentication services write indexing large databases 
project broaden understanding anonymity 
appears example difficulty scaling anonymous communications essential feature nuisance just channel judge cut flooded 
interesting aspect service teach lot availability 
just appreciation confidentiality developed working second third order effects bell lapadula policy model amo authenticity came understood result analysing defects cryptographic protocols eternity service provides setting availability services provided despite extreme opponents imaginable
