consider certificate revocation high level perspectives temporal nonmonotonicity user interfaces risk management 
argue flawed understanding aspects revocation schemes caused schemes unnecessarily costly complex confusing 
comment briefly previous works including rivest fox lamacchia mcdaniel rubin 
keywords certificates revocation pki crl public key infrastructure pki important enabling technology ecommerce 
pki limited cost complexity confusion attributable revocation 
lot debate meaning certification revocation different revocation mechanisms proposed 
argue revocation complex confusing reasons 
revocation certification nonmonotonic 
precisely pki revocation validity certificate nonmonotonic respect time certificate may go valid invalid time passes 
pki user interface internal entities mechanisms implement interface 
literature distinction drawn clearly discussions user interface issues internal mechanism issues intermingled 
traditionally revocation schemes viewed methods provide security methods control risk 
view limits ways revocation mechanisms analyzed 
consider certification revocation perspective issues 
separate user interface ui pki internal mechanisms pki argue ui simple possible provide information needed users hide rest 
particular desirable pki monotonic user interface piece information shown interface meaning monotonic respect time 
fact ui existing pki monotonic making time explicit element 
argue revocation risk management tool 
risk associated pki completely removed analyzed controlled 
revocation users control risk example setting recency requirements certificate acceptance 
smaller recency requirements lead lower risk require higher communication computation cost 
setting right recency requirement requires risk analysis balancing risk cost 
clear different applications different risk requirements different users different preferences risk cost balance 
pki aiming support multiple applications provide revocation interface tunable 
users able set different recency requirements needs resources 
ui pki helpful auditing easy obtain proof certificate valid particular time past 
useful detecting fraudulent transactions occur 
useful user risk assumed third party requires user provide proof followed policy transaction 
background public key certificate certificate short data record digitally signed private key entity possesses private key signs certificate called issuer certification authority ca certificate 
data certificate include public key call subject key certificate information subject key holder holder short entity holds private key corresponding subject key 
certificate binds subject key information 
example certificate may bind distinguished name dn entity public key 
certificate may express implicitly trust issuer holder 
example ca ca certificate implicitly suggests trustworthiness holder addition establishing dn public key binding 
binding mean binding subject key data certificate implicit trust semantics 
normally certificate validity period includes time time issuer binding period 
validity period certificate ends things may happen information certificate invalid subject key holder may report private key stolen lost issuer may suspect private key stolen holder away holder binding may shown longer accurate 
traditional approach certificate revocation certificate revocation lists crl 
crl signed ca contains issuing time list entries contains serial number certificate issued ca expired revoked architectural model pki 
model pki entities pki management entities repositories 
pki management entities include ca optionally registration authorities ra ca delegate certain management functions 
repositories systems store distribute certificates revocation data crl recommend slightly different architecture 
entities users pki interface entities rest pki user interface ui pki 
distinguish kinds entities subject key holders entities certificates making decisions call acceptors verifiers 
focus acceptors view ui interface providing information help acceptors decide accept certificate opposed interface requesting certificates 
general design principle ui 
recommendation ui pki clear simple 
provide information needed users hide 
stress clear ui precisely specify piece information exposes users meaning expected action 
review kinds user interfaces pki focusing data provided ui kind ui certificates revoked 
simplest kind 
certificates valid life times typically short 
second kind ui certificates 
standard pki belongs kind 
characteristic crl piece data crl provides current status certificates issued ca 
acceptors process lots certificates 
size typical crl quite large communication cost high acceptors process small number certificates 
third kind ui certificates validity proofs individual certificates 
proofs shorter typical crl prove validity certificates 
examples kind include ocsp online certificate status protocol crs crt revoked certificate appear crl expired 
certificate revocation tree crt provide short proofs certificate crl data time 
fourth kind ui certificates revocation notices 
see wright 
ui acceptors interested status certificate register distributes revocation notices certificate ca 
certificate revoked ca broadcasts information interested parties 
monotonic interface pki revocation leads nonmonotonicity 
certificates revoked fewer valid amount validity information decreases amount revocation information increases 
normally revocation information increases time time passes certificates revoked 
pki allows revocation validity information temporally nonmonotonic 
specifically certificate valid time may invalid time 
nonmonotonicity introduced revocation similar notion negation failure logic programming nonmonotonic reasoning literature 
negation failure means conclude needs try way prove fail concluded 
pki revocation needs prove revoked cert time decides accept certificate 
prove revoked cert conceptually needs complete information revoked 
information revoked increases time needs current information order conclude safely revoked cert distributed system distributing absolutely current information concerned parties impossible 
best deliver information 
quite expensive large scale distributed systems 
major source difficulty revocation 
recommendation difficulty revocation caused temporal nonmonotonicity pki provide interface monotonic 
fact viewed appropriately existing pki interface 
give monotonic semantics certificates information provided revocation mechanisms 
revocation meaning certificate monotonic 
certificate means issuer binding certificate validity period 
sees certificate check expired decide 
revocation possible meaning certificate complicated 
rivest discussed guarantee standard certificates certificate expiration date 
course hear revoked rivest argued guarantee useful acceptor required check certificate revoked proposed different general certificate guarantee certificate definitely 
issuer expects certificate careful acceptor wish demand certificate 
certificate considered valid guarantee combination certificates standard revokable certificates 
means certificate standard certificate 
argue interpretation certificate problematic 
meaning certificate nonmonotonic 
certificate states ca believed certificate issued 
belief may change time change may reflected revocation 
cause nonmonotonicity 
fact ca believed content certificate time issued doesn change time 
give certificate temporally monotonic meaning take issuing time part meaning certificate 
introduce simple logic representing meaning certificates 
statement logic takes form time believes true 
call fresh time statement 
logic inferencing rules 
believes true believes true 

believes true time believes true 
note logic doesn interpret belief particular doesn relate beliefs note express logic 
inferencing rule straightforward quite standard 
second rule says believes time believing times 
certainly false general beliefs appropriate purpose monotonic reasoning certificates revocation 
show certificates revocation data crl represented statements logic 
recommendation propose interpretation certificates issuing time issuer believes information certificate true 
reading temporally monotonic true time 
note interpretation issuing time explicit part fresh time meaning certificate 
certificate states issuer belief issuing time view revocation schemes mechanisms issuer belief time 
certificate issued fresh time binding certificate 
obtains proof certificate revoked time update fresh time 
consider case time tu acceptor wants certificate validity period issuing time fresh time tf acceptor check time past say fresh requirement dt issuer certificate believed binding true current time tu 
words verifier needs check time tu dt issuer believed binding true tu tu 
inferencing rules verifier needs check tu tf tu dt 
choice dt policy acceptor needs decide 
doesn want check revocation set dt tf tu dt true 
existing certificate formats time fields assumed time issue time 
willing assumption interpret existing standard certificates recommendation 
think certificate separate issue time order allow post dated certificates issued 
post dated certificate revoked validity period begins 
crl issued claim certificates listed fresh time 
argue criticize crl negative statements 
disagree 
notice certificates revoked negative list revoked certificates provides positive information certificates listed valid 
cases efficient listing certificates 
argument crl doesn provide positive information doesn prove existence certificate 
disagree 
purpose revocation complement certification replace 
purpose crl prove binding valid update fresh time existing proof certificate 
certificate caring revocation 
similarly responses online certificate status protocol ocsp information revocation schemes viewed proofs believed time 
section reviewed kinds ui pki 
kind uses revocation notices interpreted recommendation 
revocation notice piece negative information 
fails reach acceptor acceptor may accept revoked certificate valid 
want stress point difficulty revocation caused temporal nonmonotonicity 
revocation information changes time needs sufficiently information revocation 
previous tries certification revocation monotonic address time issue 
gunter jim argued revocation information handled way certificates system query certificate manager qcm revocation monotonic 
qcm dual notions positive sets negative sets crl negative set 
positive set qcm certificate states element member set 
negative set qcm certificate states element member set 
environment set qcm certificates 
claim qcm revocation monotonic means larger environment leads 
environment nonmonotonic respect time specifically qcm certificate negative set may go true false time passes 
user decide accept certificate needs forget old environment get sufficiently 
doesn decrease amount information needs transmitted 
semantics revoking certificate cancel certificate may revoked reasons 
fox lamacchia argued revocation different reasons different semantics 
verifier knows certificate revoked verifier remove revoked certificate certificate chain graph 
words revoking certificate cancels 
question follows revoking certificate 
consider example 
example 

cn chain certificates cn certificate interest self signed trusted root certificate issued ci 
signed private key corresponding ki subject key ci 
integer 
second chain certificates kj 
suppose certificate revoked certificates chains valid 
certificate chains user cn user accept binding cn equivalently acceptance decision cj treated valid 
fox lamacchia argued cj treated valid may revoked depends reason revoking certificate cases key kj compromised case cj treated revoked 
binding longer valid case cj treated invalid contains binding 
binding may valid issuer doesn want anymore case cj valid 
desirable revoke certificates concerning compromised private key argue done internally side pki ui external exposed users 
interpreting revocation revoking cj enlarges domain acceptor needs complete information 
cj needs know revoked cj needs know revoked related cj 
effect changing trust relationship 
interpretation certificate path 
certificate needs ca agree private key compromised binding valid ca veto binding issuing certificate revoking key compromise reasons 
just expensive may undesirable 
believe revocation schemes shouldn change trust relationships pki 
ca wants revoke certificate ca revokes related certificate arrangement user interface 
user needs source confirm binding separate proof private key compromised clearly specified user policy shouldn accomplished indirectly revocation 
recommendation revocation certificate cancel certificate 
revocation provides risk management pki traditionally computer security mechanisms try ensure insecure things happen 
alternative view 
summarize follows complex systems secured point 
insecurity exists destroyed 
question ask system secure secure system relative perceived threat page 
insecurity exists precisely situation global scale publickey infrastructure 
total security unattainable unrealistic assumption revocation information delivered instantaneously 
private key may compromised long compromise discovered certificates key revoked 
handled revocation schemes taken consideration analyzing risk inherent pki 
acknowledge risk exists view revocation schemes way control risk 
traditionally implicitly assumed get crl 
piece evidence assumption crl update field crl assumed expired date newer crl needed 
risk management view crl clear doesn need current crl 
set recency requirements matter policy 
long user crl okay 
strict recency requirements lower risk higher communication costs 
risk application dependent different applications users different recency requirements 
recommendation 
recommendation pki serves diverse applications provide flexible revocation schemes tuned support different recency requirements 
exposed risk accepting certificate set recency requirements 
party higher risk debated 
rivest argued recency requirements set acceptor certificate certificate issuer acceptor risk decision wrong 
mcdaniel rubin disagreed 
argued business consumer commerce scenarios consumers browsers need decide accept merchant website certificate valid establish secure connection consumers usually transferring credit card numbers connection limited liability 
conversely merchant risks reputation unsafe operation risk higher merchants acceptors 
fox lamacchia said theory certificate authority lose continued circulation bad certificate credit card transmission scenario parties risk fraudulent transaction 
merchant certification authorities risk reputation damage risk limited tangible 
note talking damage caused fraudulent transaction consumer accepts certificate shouldn result sends credit card number intruder damage caused revocation certificate 
merchant certificate revoked key compromise merchant suffered great loss reputation single fraudulent transaction occurs 
means merchant high incentive protect private key doesn necessarily higher risk customer fraudulent transaction 
argue fraudulent transactions damage merchant reputation hard quantify damage additional fraudulent transaction 
importantly way merchants ca enforce requirements 
suggestions recency requirements suitable particular kinds transactions ca revocation information available 
customers don follow suggestions isn ca merchants 
free reputation damage long suggestions 
acceptor primary risk 
cases acceptor protected insurance risk limited small 
case highest risk 
case credit card scenario 
note credit card numbers aren kind information transmitted secure connections 
online banking trading customer may transmitting account numbers pins valuable credit card numbers 
acceptor insured part acceptor risk transferred 
strong incentive set enforce recency requirements 
point decision acceptor enforce recency standard decides accept certificate 
note granularity recency standard limited revocation mechanisms available acceptor 
pki crl revocation interface crl issued time interval operate recency requirement smaller enforce recency requirement transaction occurs goes wrong acceptor claim 
set recency requirement require acceptor provide proof followed requirement transaction 
recommendation ui pki support auditing 
example pki supports crl maintain crl keeps revoked certificates time revoked expired 
parties crl check certificate valid time past 
allowing certificate revoked allows certificate put hold temporarily disabled activated 
difficult scheme deal certificates notion certificates hold significantly complicates revocation 
certificates revoked revocation status certificate temporally monotonic validity status 
certificate go valid revoked 
recording time change fact change occurred determines status life certificate 
certificate put hold revocation status certificate temporally monotonic 
know status history certificate needs know changes occurred past 
harder particular acceptor believes certificate valid time past especially acceptors different recency requirements 
argue better disallow notion certificate hold 
alternative ca revoke certificate issue new certificate binding needed 
recommendation recommend allowing certificates put hold order simplify auditing semantics revocation 
addition useful scenarios involve auditing earlier detection potentially fraudulent transactions 
consider acceptor crl issued time scheduled obtain new crl time 
suppose crl time doesn contain certificate time acceptor accept valid 
certificate revoked time potentially problematic 
useful detect acceptor obtains new crl 
crl support kind auditing support variable recency requirements time crl keep revoked certificate longer required 
revoked certificate required appear crl expired 
certificate revoked expired crl issued expired acceptor won know transaction involving potentially problematic 
solution ca set parameters issuing crl new crl issued revoked certificate kept crl expired 
uses crl set recency requirement different revocation mechanisms proposed extensive debate revocation mechanisms best provide recency proofs 
think answers depend specific application scenarios 
scheme fits scenarios 
example crl small number acceptors high communication capacity process lots requests large number certificate holders 
case intranet setting internal web server authenticating employees certificates 
case efficient web server obtain check crl certificate holders required obtain proofs 
hand crl suitable commerce scenarios customers browsers acceptors 
large number acceptors processes small number requests 
furthermore acceptors limited network bandwidth 
efficient browser deal crl better server obtain recency proof reuse different browsers 
case revocation mechanisms generate short validity proofs certificates needed 
fact existing pki lack ability provide short validity proofs reason revocation commerce scenarios 
summary pki clear simple user interface temporally monotonic supports functionality needed applications 
depending application may necessary pki support tunable revocation services auditing
