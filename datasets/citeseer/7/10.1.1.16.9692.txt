primary today palm top computers day planners address books notebooks expect memory aids important application wearable computers 
current computer memory aids written life easier computer person 
example available methods accessing computer data filenames forcing user recall name file browsing forcing user scan list recognize name file 
methods easy program require user memory task 
hierarchical directories structured data calendar programs help data structured break file query doesn fit redesigned structure 
similarly key word searches user think set words uniquely identifies searched 
human memory operate vacuum query response pairs 
contrary context remembered episode provides lots cues recall 
cues include physical location event happening time happened immediately tulving 
information helps recall events partial context associate current environment past experiences related 
computers access user current context computational task outside environment 
example word processor access words currently typed files previously viewed 
way knowing user thinking talking reading wearable computers give opportunity bring new sensors technology everyday life pieces physical context information wearable computers aid memory information humans 
start describing features available wearable computers available current laptops personal digital assistants pdas

ffl proactive wearable able convey information user actively 
example computer wants know new email able communicate information immediately 
ffl default wearable working sensing acting 
opposed normal pen pdas normally sit pocket woken task needs done 
remembrance agent remembrance agent program continuously watches shoulder wearer wearable computer displays line summaries notes files old email papers text information relevant user current context 
summaries listed bottom lines heads display wearer read information quick glance 
retrieve text described summary line wearer hits quick chord keyboard 
desktop ra earlier desktop version ra described rhodes starner 
previous version suggests old email papers text documents relevant file currently written read word processor 
system daily year suggestions produces quite useful 
example researchers indexed journal abstracts past years ra suggest papers currently writing 
system keep track email threads recommending old email relevant current email read 
wearable ra system ported wearable computer new applications apparent 
example notes conference talks remembrance agent suggest document lead questions speaker 
wearable taken ra offer suggestions notes taken coffee breaks laptop computers normally 
advantage display proactive wearer need expect suggestion order receive 
common practice wearables users conferences type name person met shaking hands 
ra occasionally remind wearer person name entered met suggest notes taken previous conversation 
useful system described go far physical sensors integrated wearable computer 
example wearer system type name person met conference 
wearable automatically know spoken active badge systems eventually automatic face recognition 
similarly wearable know physical location gps indoor location sensor 
available automatically detected physical context new ra help determine relevant information 
context information indexing suggestion mode 
indexing notes taken wearable tagged context information stored retrieval 
suggestion mode wearer current physical context find relevant information 
sensor data available example active badge system wearer type additional context information 
current version ra uses context cues produce relevant suggestions ffl wearer physical location 
information provided gps indoor location system location entered explicitly user keyboard 
ffl people currently 
information come active badge system person wearable computer entered wearer 
ffl subject field entered wearer extra tag indexing extracted header fields subject line email 
ffl date time stamp 
stamped note files single chord keyboard extracted structured data 
retrieval information comes system clock 
ffl information body note turned word vector keyword analysis 
retrieval information comes wearer currently reading writing heads display 
example scenario interaction context cues apparent 
say wearer ra system student heading history class 
enters classroom note files previously entered classroom time day start appear 
notes related current course 
starts take notes egyptian text notes trigger suggestions pointing readings note files 
suggestions biased favor particular setting subject field 
gets class runs fellow student identity student entered explicitly conveyed active badge system 
ra starts bring suggestions pointing notes entered person including idea project proposal students working 
internal clock wearable gets close time calendar entry reminding wearer meeting ra brings pointers entry remind way 
internals indexing documents note written location person subject date tags automatically attached note available 
context tags available example active badge writer note enter field hand keyboard 
fields left blank 
new tags added easily hoped new sensors available integrated existing system replace hand entry 
context fields determined source physical sensors 
example subject person tags automatically extracted email header information 
case person field person sent email person happens read email 
indexed file structured source email html detected ra automatically picks information file 
multiple notes documents detected broken single file case email archive file 
tagged notes email information sources indexed back 
common words body note file thrown remaining words stemmed converted word vector number occurrences word indexed document element vector 
large files broken smaller overlapping windows topic single vector tend remain focused 
window information suggestion mode jump relevant part suggested document brought full viewing 
indexing method previous version ra smart algorithm described salton 
indexing body location person date subject information encoded typed tokenized words merged vector 
suggestion mode running normal suggestion mode ra convert current screen full text looked word vector way vectors created indexing 
current location person date subject context information merged query vector vector weighted heavily favor context cues favor main body vector 
ra compare query vector indexed vectors 
case discrete information word person subject room location information similarity dot product vectors 
larger relevant particular document query vector 
case vectors continuous features date gps coordinates distance closest elements create weighted relevance 
similarities vectors produce weighted sum relevant documents summarized 
summary lines displayed continuously bottom lines heads display shown 
context changing suggestions updated seconds 
screen shot wearable ra 
main screen notes taken workshop wearable computing bottom shows ra suggestions 
suggestions email person field automatically filled field 
third entry person information available defaulted owner file 
suggestion summary line jog memory lookup necessary 
desirable look complete summarized 
cases single chord hit keyboard bring suggested main buffer 
suggested file large ra automatically jump relevant point file displaying 
explicit query ra designed proactive reminder system provides functionality standard fuzzy query database engine 
entering query emacs prompt wearer override current context cues new input 
hardware ra composed front written emacs lisp back written runs unix platforms 
currently running linux wearable mhz tin lizzy design developed thad starner starner 
input device keyboard called reach typing speeds words minute full function keyboard 
output device private eye heads display monochrome display produces crisp character screen 
display currently worn hat top computer pointing top right corner wearer field view see 
mount position gives wearer ability full eye contact allowing access full screen information single glance 
wearables group media lab experimented mounts provide overlay effect text graphics real world starner 
related probably closest system forget system developed rank xerox research center lamming flynn 
forget pda system records user phone information stores database query 
differs ra ra looks retrieves specific textual information just diary events ra capacity proactive suggestions answer queries 
heads display wearable platform 
systems exist provide contextual cues managing information traditional desktop system 
example lifestreams project provides complete file management system time stamp freeman gelernter 
provides ability tag events meeting times trigger alarms shortly occur 
systems exist recommend webpages pages user currently browsing lieberman armstrong 
design issues physical tags extension ra base system running wearable platform months design issues apparent prototype 
issues help drive set revisions 
biggest design trade ra making continuous suggestions versus occasionally flashing suggestions obtrusive way 
continuous display designed tolerant false positives possible distract wearer real world little possible 
continuous display allows wearer receive new suggestion literally blink eye having keyboard button 
suggestions displayed especially relevant suggestions available wearer tendency distrust display weeks limited experience suggests wearer tends ignore display looking screen anyway realize suggestion available 
version ra cull low relevancy hits entirely display leaving variable length display trustworthy suggestions 
furthermore notifications judged important example notification scheduled event happen accompanied visual bell flashes screen times 
flashing wearable communications system current heads mounted display satisfactory getting wearer attention cases 
lesson learned interface communications system screen radically change important message available 
way wearer need read text see important alert 
currently communications system prints large reverse video line lower half screen quickly determine message arrived 
trade showing lots text screen versus showing important text large fonts 
current design shows entire column row screen produces text wearer scan trying carry conversation 
versions experiment variable font size animated typography small
