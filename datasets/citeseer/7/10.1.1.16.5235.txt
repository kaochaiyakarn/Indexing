tree construction quantization tree partitions feature space number discrete regions analogous voronoi polygons surrounding vq vectors 
decision tree involves comparing vector xed threshold going left right child depending value greater lesser 
threshold chosen maximize mutual information data associated class labels indicate class datum

resulting histogram captures essential class qualities serves template histograms may compared 
tree structured quantizer especially practical may pruned di erent sizes depending amount data 
histogram bin leaf tree tree size directly determines size histogram template
