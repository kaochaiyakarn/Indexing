cognitive processing load group cmc members virtual public variable levels cognitive effort individuals willing invest processing interactive cmc cognitive load group cmc illustrates individual cognitive processing limits linked group communication 
cognitive processing loads group cmc displayed 
different cognitive loads different individuals willing able process group messages 
cognitive processing abilities groups simply sum individual cognitive processing capacities

know communication processing load relates number message system characteristics 
users generally effort reply coherently thread lewis knowles single message 
higher interactivity correlates higher communication processing load 
interactive communication refers extent messages sequence relate especially extent messages relatedness earlier messages rafaeli sudweeks 
similarly high frequency postings require processing group members

example disrupted turn adjacency may require increased user effort track sequential exchanges 
disrupted turn adjacency caused fact cmc systems email lists transmit messages order received 
group cmc message may separated previous message responding message lags message transmission may result reversed sequencing 
different cmc technologies different typical message system characteristics
