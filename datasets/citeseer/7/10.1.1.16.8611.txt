opinion denoted tuple coordinates dependent eq represent traditional belief plausibility pair belief theory

opinions situated left right corner called absolute opinions 
represent situations absolutely certain state true false correspond true false proposition binary logic 
opinions ordered probability expectation value additional criteria needed case equal probability expectation values 
definition determine order opinions definition ordering opinions opinions 
ordered criteria priority opinion greatest probability expectation greatest opinion 
opinion uncertainty greatest opinion 
opinion relative atomicity greatest opinion 
criterion self evident 
second criterion supported experimental findings described

evidential operators far described elements frame discernment states 
practice states verbally described propositions example consists possible colours ball drawn urn red black balls designates state colour drawn urn red interpreted verbal proposition draw red ball 
opinions considered held individuals ownership assigned relevant 
notation superscripts indicate ownership subscripts indicate proposition opinion applies 
example opinion held agent truth proposition section describe operators discounting consensus suitable subjective evidential reasoning 
operators suitable subjective logic reasoning described 
discounting assume agents opinion form proposition knowledgeable tell truth 
addition opinion proposition agent form opinion discounting opinion opinion thing physical belief discounting discounting opinions lends different interpretations 
main difficulty lies describing effect give advice 
interpret thinks uncertain truth value uncertain truth value matter actual advice definition captures idea 
definition discounting agent opinion agent recommender proposition opinion expressed recommendation opinion called discounting expressing opinion result advice symbol designate operator define discounting function defined shafer uses discounting rate denote belief mass state belief mass multiplied 
setting definition equivalent shafer definition 
easy prove associative commutative 
means case chain discounting opinions start order opinions significant 
chain advisor opinion independence assumed example translates allowing entity appear chain 
consensus consensus possibly conflicting opinions opinion reflects opinions fair equal way observers beliefs truth resulting distinct pieces evidence consensus operator produces consensus belief combines separate beliefs 
example process produce outcomes observed process different time intervals formed independent opinions likelihood occur consensus opinion belief occur single agent having observed process periods 
see formal justification consensus operator 
definition consensus opinions proposition relative defined opinion defined called consensus representing imaginary agent opinion represented symbol designate operator define easy prove consensus operator commutative associative 
opinion independence assumed 
consensus totally uncertain opinions results new totally uncertain opinion relative atomicity defined case 
incorrectly stated consensus operator applied dogmatic opinions 
definition dogmatic opinions combined 
result obtained computing limits relative result consensus operator general dempster rule excludes combination totally conflicting beliefs 
order understand meaning relative useful consider process possible outcomes fx xg produces times example throwing fair dice mechanism sure observes outcome observes outcome think dice produces think dice produces 
infinitely observations conflicting dogmatic opinions respectively 
average observes times events remains times dogmatic meaning relative 
combining opinions case def inserting value get combined opinion obtaining dice 
assumed initially agreed relative atomicity obtaining dice 
example assessment testimony witnesses consider court case witnesses giving testimony express opinions verbal proposition accused 
assume verbal proposition true false witness express opinion truth proposition opinions 
judge determine opinion function trust witness reliable similarly situation illustrated fig arrows denote trust opinions truth
