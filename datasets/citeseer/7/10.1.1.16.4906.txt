keywords electronic textbook adaptive navigation support web education student model adaptive hypermedia web education case adaptation research papers media publications report substantial success web education careful analysis situation informal discussions line teachers show web education quite far achieving main goal reaching wide distance audience cost effective sound manner particular accommodating requirements students underrepresented groups 
positive experiences show web education works prepared motivated students reasonably homogeneous virtual classrooms 
example successful area masters level courses distance graduate students certificate programs students college degrees various web courses senior level students take course remote campus 
web teaching junior level students prepared require lot attention teacher difficult 
currently computer mediated communication cmc tools deliver instruction works campus students visit teachers assistants office hours 
worst case junior level distance students supposed main audience web education 
current experience shows distance education works teachers assistants afford lot time web mail telephone communication students note internet communication time consuming real time phone communication 
encouraging 
current pioneer distance students special reasonably prepared motivated register web course distance problem example high schools students earning credits 
needs changed current model web distance education available prepared motivated students 
think difficulties web education course material currently comes various forms lectures tutorials examples assignments 
current web courses course material implicitly oriented traditional campus audience reasonably homogeneous reasonably prepared motivated students access teachers assistants fill possible gaps resolve misunderstandings 
web courses wider variety users campus courses 
learners may different goals backgrounds knowledge levels learning capabilities 
web course designed particular class users mind usually done campus courses may suit users 
way enhance course material richer flexible different students get personalized content personalized order presentation 
current web courses respect flexible 
best case course material network static hypertext pages media enhancement 
teacher delivery system adapt course presentation different students 
result students waste time learning irrelevant known material students fail understand just misunderstand material consequently overload distance teacher multiple questions requests additional information 
suggestion develop web courses adapt users different backgrounds prior knowledge subject learning goals 
example students specific goals get parts course detail students knowledge subject taught known material prepared students get examples problems starting simple 
distinguish levels steps increasing complexity way flexible adaptive courseware

users worked complex information systems simply cope advanced hyperspaces offered modern web applications 
rarely able find hyperspace path relevant knowledge background goals 
second step teachers tune generic course needs particular students classes specifying subset topics learn order learning 
third step provide adaptive guidance mechanisms specially tailored accommodate current knowledge learning goals information seeking tasks individual user
