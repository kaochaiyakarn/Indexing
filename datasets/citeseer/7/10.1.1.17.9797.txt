note dimension levels fact attributes characterize measure analyzed analysis paths valid sequences drill roll operations 
path example scenario customer residence address form area city region 
assume customers city attribute set residence area belong city 
case residence area customer linked grouping classification relationship directly residence region residence city happens residence areas 
generally speaking grouping classification relationship may involve levels member level may drill members different levels 
aspects grouping classification relationship important 
cases member level linked members level 
example member product level probably linked members advertising method level product simultaneously advertised various methods newspapers tv radio 
members level may links detailed level 
example may member store area level linked members store level 
mean time store area system know want show stores belong area 
examples show natural model grouping classification relationships involve way relationships levels 
relationships members involved levels 
consider queries analysts ask 
query give sum sales year month product group product class store city store region 
question requires aggregation levels path 
example requires sum sales product group sum sales product class 
query result represented grid fashion shown 
notice measure values region store region correspond sum values city city cities probably store region includes areas part city 
example result query consider case analyst uses paths dimension classification grouping sales data 
give sum sales year customer profession residence region 
levels grouping profession residence region fact independent belong dimension 
grouping time defines dimensional space 
levels related store city store region previous query onedimensional space 
sellis product class group group product class group group january feb 
store region store region city city city city query shows necessity supporting multiple measures defined set dimensions 
give sum sales maximum sale value number sales store month year 
cases measures functionally dependent primitive measures 
generally speaking set primitive derived measures simultaneously required analysis process 
query complicated selection condition give sum sales month store area brand selecting store areas increased total sales year percent previous year 
query requires calculation total sales value store area years selection areas sum sales value year greater sum sales value year 
store areas query requires sum sales calculated month brand 
typical query performs selection aggregated data different level data required output

multidimensional aggregation cube mac data model section multidimensional aggregation cube data model 
mac user centric conceptual data model attempts cover requirements described previous section order provide highly expressive intuitive modeling methodology information multidimensional analysis 
mac model uses concepts close way olap users perceive information 
model tries expressive providing means model complicated real world scenarios minimal set concepts remain simple possible 
mac model describes data dimension levels drilling relationships dimension paths dimensions cubes attributes 
dimension levels represent classes dimension members 
dimension member represents instance real world property olap measure may 
distinct dimension levels related means drilling relationship 
drilling relationship indicates semantic relationship involved levels describes dimension members children levels grouped sets correspond dimension members parent level 
set drilling relationships form dimension path structural requirements met 
dimension path defines meaningful composition drilling relationships model valid sequence abstraction operations drill roll 
dimension paths share common levels form dimension 
define multidimensional aggregation cubes macs relationship domains dimensions 
mac measures 
considered simple atomic attribute relationship represented mac 
instance mac called mac cell simply cell 
give complete definition terms provide examples 
simple term cube refer multidimensional aggregation cube dimension levels dimension level set dimension members 
dimension members detailed modeling concepts model represent instances realworld properties olap measures may 
example scenario sale price measure multidimensional analysis 
property measure location sale took place cashier sale recorded 
example scenario define dimension level cashier order represent sales transactions take sellis place particular cashier store modeled dimension member level 
dimension levels attributes 
subset attributes form key dimension level 
cases single attribute acts key multi attribute keys exist 
due set semantics dimension levels 
set semantics dimension member represents uniquely identifiable level property instance 
example scenario requires dimension levels defined

drilling relationships drilling relationship special kind way relationship relates dimension level called parent relationship dimension levels called children relationship 
formally speaking drilling relationship way relationship relate member parent level members children levels means instance drilling relationship relate members children levels linking exactly member parent level 
furthermore parent dimension level drilling relationship act child level relationship 
reasons imposing restrictions explained defining semantics drilling relationship 
drilling relationship represent way member level decomposed members level 
explain semantics drilling relationship simple example assume drilling relationship store cashier store cashier relates member store parent level store members cashier cashier unique child level cashier 
semantics relationship measure value characterized property value cashier similar measure value characterized property value cashier compute applying proper aggregation function measure value property store 
word similar definition means apart cashier cashier don require relationship strict complete 
members parent children levels may left unrelated 
parent level members may related child level member 
properties measure values characterized set property values 
semantics drilling relationship easily see parent level child level recursive calculations measure values 
situation meaningless olap applications require parent level drilling relationship different children level 
proved requirement restrict modeling power affect way dimension members grouped dimension levels 
dimension levels drilling relationships attributes 
due simple decomposition semantics drilling relationships 
drilling relationships represent general relationships dimension members attributes allowed 
example scenario simple drilling relationship linking level cashier level store 
store level parent level relationship level cashier child level 
member store level related members cashier level indicating store 
complicated example relationship levels residence region residence city residence area 
level residence region contains members geographical regions interest 
level residence city contains cities regions level residence area contains individual geographical areas cities regions decomposed 
obviously cities cover areas regions areas linked directly regions 
order represent situation define drilling relationships 
residence region parent level residence city residence area child levels 
relationship links region appropriate cities areas 
second drilling relationship residence city parent level residence area child level represents decomposition cities areas 
argue drilling relationships simpler child 
example dummy cities grouping areas real city 
cities directly related areas levels existed residence city residence areas need dummy members intermediate level 
believe modeling solution semantically wrong dummy members correspond real world 
furthermore solution result unnatural complicated drill operations 
sellis product class product group product brand dimension paths dimension path set drilling relationships model meaningful sequence drill operations 
simple form dimension path sequence drilling relationships having child level 
chain child level drilling relationship parent level drilling relationship 
child level drilling relationship called detailed level dimension path 
dimension paths defined order model paths multidimensional analysis usually performed 
field multidimensional analysis drill roll operations follow pre designated paths individual drilling relationships 
means level parent multiple drilling relationships drill operation performed relationships belongs dimension path analysis currently performed 
order formally define dimension path define graph set drilling relationships 
set drilling relationships graph directed graph properties node graph represents level referenced member level referenced drilling relationships parent child level graph contain node represents particular dimension level 
drilling relationship child level relationship graph contains directed edge parent drilling relationship child level 
formally define dimension path non empty set drilling relationships properties advertising method item warehouse city dimensions item location 
graph exactly node incoming edges 

graph circles dag 

drilling relationships having parent level 
note definition dimension path build support aggregating members detailed level common operation multidimensional analysis 
example example query requires aggregation customers second example query requires aggregation products 
order achieve aggregation path special dimension level usually called containing unique member called defined 
furthermore artificial drilling relationship complete link detailed level members unique member level defined 
complete link means members detailed level directly related member indirectly related sequence drilling relationships defined path 
level usually related highest available level path directly detailed level 
example scenario need define paths 
fact path described dimension path mac model 
path add special dimension level 
path add level meaningful aggregate members advertising method 
recall product may related advertising method 
gives graphical representation dimension levels drilling relationships dimension paths dimensions item location example scenario 
sellis warehouse warehouse region warehouse area store region store area store cashier location store city dimension level drilling relationship dimension path dimension dimensions dimension concept define meaningful groups dimension paths 
grouping essential order model semantic relationships exist various paths allows powerful olap modeling show examples follow 
dimensions complex concepts model represent various properties measures assist process multidimensional analysis 
complex structure dimensions considered classify properties various levels define hierarchical relationship properties different levels describe meaningful drilling paths 
formally speaking dimension non empty set paths 
dimension contains path path common level path dimension 
common levels assigned meaning various paths appear 
example replace example residence city store city levels general city level paths having common level 
paths share common level combined dimension assign different meaning common level 
city level represent residence cities customers represent cities stores located 
reason grouping dimension paths dimensions semantic relationship usually exists various paths 
example consider paths 
paths characterize sales measures store point view 
paths level store represent stores sales recorded group paths view location dimension sales measure 
generally speaking say number paths involved define dimension depend content dimension complexity scenario modeled 
define graph dimension union individual graphs dimension paths 
recall graph dimension level represented unique node definitions dimension graph connected graph 
gives graph dimension client 
customer residence area profession residence city residence region graph dimension client dimensions extreme importance model definition cubes 
cube definition involve dimensions sets paths sets call dimension values dimension value simple dimension member set dimension members 
formally speaking define dimension value dimension dimension member level set compatible dimension members belonging distinct non related levels 
dimension members called compatible possible find level dimension dimension member roll combination drilling relationships dimension members 
term distinct means level dimension member participate dimension value 
furthermore levels participating dimension called non related path directed graph dimension linking levels 
definition realize dimension values depend structure dimension particular instances levels drilling relationships 
set possible dimension values defined dimension called dimension domain 
note instance dimension domain depends instances levels drilling relationships schema dimension determines structure dimension domain defining possible combinations non related levels 
take example dimension client graph shown 
member levels customer residence area residence city residence region profession dimension value 
athens north athens east members residence area level doctor teacher members profession level members dimension value 
combination members profession level residence area may valid dimension value 
customer level contains member rolls doctor member athens north member set athens north doctor valid dimension value 
customer member represent doctor customer living north athens 
similar constrains hold order sets athens north teacher athens east doctor athens east teacher dimension values 
combination members possible non related levels 
means member residence city set athens north definitely valid dimension value 
athens north area city redundant mention athens north combination members meaningless 
note difference terms dimension value dimension member 
sellis intuition dimension domains dimension values represent possible properties multidimensional analysis 
example query may ask customers living athens north may ask customers doctor profession live athens north area 
meaningful ask customers live athens north area city time include 
furthermore customer level includes members doctors living athens east area dimension domain include combination values making obvious answer queries 
structure content dimension domains valuable source information semantic query optimization algorithm 
multidimensional aggregation cubes multidimensional aggregation cube mac main complex concept model 
concepts previously described directly indirectly definition mac 
dimension levels model properties measures drilling relationships define relationships levels dimension paths group drilling relationships dimensions group paths 
mac concept associates property values actual measure values stresses complex hierarchical structure defined dimensions 
formally speaking multidimensional aggregation cube way relationship relating dimension domains 
relationship attributes represent measures mac 
instance relationship called cell defines relationship dimension value involved domains 
cell annotated values cube attributes measure values 
dimension values cell relates called coordinates cell 
obviously measures cube functionally dependant coordinates 
assume example cube defined domains dimensions location item having sum sales measure 
contains cells defined table represents sum sales measure cell coordinates name item location cell product cashier cashier cell product cashier cashier cell brand cashier cashier table cells example cube measure cell represents sum sales done cashier product 
likewise measure cell represents sum sales done cashier product 
cell represents sum sales done cashier products brand 
assuming products brand cell represents aggregation cell cell 
means measure cell equal sum measures cell cell 
example reveals key property mac model instances cube cells cube represent measure values different granularities functional dependency 
example cell refers sales measured product cashier cell refers sales measured brand cashier 
cells defined different levels granularity part cube 
due definition dimension domain states members participating levels valid dimension values 
believe property cubes crucial compact intuitive representation multidimensional data 
explained section olap users usually handle data defined various levels granularity 
queries may impose selection conditions various dimension levels may require result completely different granularity 
furthermore granularity source data may vary 
example store may change time period way records sales 
store record sum sales product product cashier 
example cube contains predicted actual sales 
predicted values may computable lowest detail level higher levels 
final example security reasons detailed data may available stores particular area 
single granularity cubes time needed new combination levels add new cube schema 
schema get complicated queries 
schema include dimensions cubes functional dependencies existing cubes 
queries aware available cubes functional dependencies 
select ones probably join defining grouping operations parts cubes 
approach allows single cube include data meaningful granularities 
doing simplify schema making usable users 
approach allows queries expressed elegant straightforward way avoiding declaration joins 
consider example cube defined domain dimensions time location item client 
structure dimensions illustrated addition special level described earlier 
assume unique measure represents sum sales 
schema query described sellis section expressed simple manner 
qbe notation style define query table 
notation defines coordinates measures returned result set 
time location item client month store area brand year store area year store area table query additional advantage approach typical olap operations drill roll slice dice translated simple selection queries cube 
example drill results product level expressed simply replacing brand product item coordinate table 
important argument modeling approach 
cube represent cells measures functionally dependent guaranty consistency 
measure cell table violating way definition cube 
semantically point view value inconsistent values cell cell 
inability guaranty consistency comes total absence involved aggregation functions 
measure cube semantically related aggregation 
examples measure sum sales obviously related sum aggregation function 
cube definition include relationship making impossible consistency checking 
intentionally chosen include aggregation functions mac model number reasons 
decided define operations include aggregation functions cover functional aspects data current model aspects orthogonal defined concepts 
model extended include aggregation functions consistency checking algorithms operations changing existing mac concepts 
furthermore separate functional model cover needs 
seams separate functional model suitable application domain requires specific aggregation functions operations consistency semantics 
example applications acceptable view analyze data includes inconsistent parts due missing incomplete wrong information 
separate functional model tailored cope operations data 
forcing consistency data modeling level model inappropriate applications
