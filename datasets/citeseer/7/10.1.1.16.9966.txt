collaborative filtering browsing tapestry system coined term collaborative filtering mail system filters mail news articles annotations users 
system supports query language tql enables user find articles meet specific needs 
user instance obtain articles recommended specified person 
system suitable large community users don necessarily know meant support group user specify appropriate actual users get information 
popular collaborative filtering systems automate selection users share interests user 
computing similarity users rating patterns system provides user similar users neighbors items recommend 
described previous section user needs tools exploration addition automatic filters 
collaborative browsing studied help multiple users collaborate browsing synchronously asynchronously 
systems provide group users tools share processes histories browsing 
large community systems need additional ways organize diverse information users various interests tastes 
browse helps group users find items common interest don know 
system designed real time browsing sessions provides appropriate topics specific participants search appropriate reviewers specific interests 
system designed exploration various users reviewers large community exploration items movies 
user automatically manually create various virtual reviewers consists set movies set users movies 
filter uses single durable profile handle user general interests multiple virtual reviewers provide various viewpoints help user explore reviewers movies 
virtual reviewers ratings reviews movie database user give rating rating review review 
distinguish users rolls collaborative exploration call user reviews reviewer user browses reviews reader 
user reviewer reader 
rating value integer ranges awful excellent users supposed assume margin positive negative ratings 
rating rating default value 
virtual reviewer user represent viewpoint combining multiple movies 
mv set movies represents viewpoint set users uv movies mv defined uv fans mv fans liking function liking returns user liking movies set movie define virtual reviewer respect viewpoint mv uv 
virtual user characterize movies reviewers rating data uv mv respectively 
example liking values user movie defined liking liking respectively 
liking value currently adopt mean ratings liking rating um recommendation set movies appeal set user defined favorites liking recommendations rv reviews virtual user respect viewpoint defined favorites review uv reviews selecting movies reader rated obtain focused recommendations collaborative filtering results 
delivery news storing virtual reviewer reader filter delivers new information viewpoint 
virtual reviewer respect viewpoint stored user profiles set movies mv 
note set user uv fans mv varies members new reviewers give reviews ratings 
virtual reviewer provides reader new members uv rv 
composing virtual reviewers reader represent viewpoint arbitrary set movies movies directed particular director movies reader likes movies reader wants see 
described section automatic clustering function helps reader select movies database 
exploration clustering enable reader explore movies reviews various viewpoints developed browsing method involves recommendation virtual reviewers automatic clustering technique 
applying recommendation clustering repeatedly reader refine set movies represent viewpoint traverse sets movies explore various viewpoints 
clustering procedure divides set movies multiple sets movies similarities movies cluster applied simple vector space model compute similarity rating patterns 
members mi similar certain sense mi considered represent certain viewpoint reader obtain recommendations mi 
applying clustering procedure reader refine movie clusters represent desirable viewpoints 
iterative refinement document browsing method called scatter gather applies iterative document clustering browse large document collections 
initial set items browsing method repeats steps 
system shows list clusters equations user chooses 
cluster cluster 
reader selects subset 
system merges clusters new cluster extended original scatter gather interaction introducing recommendations virtual user equation 
exploration clustering goes follows 
applying iterative clustering reader composes set movies 
reader obtains recommendations viewpoint represented 
reader compose new set movies represent new viewpoint 
original scatter gather interaction starts large set documents search results data set 
exploration viewpoint start various sizes movie sets interest reader single movie initial set movies 
typical initial sets include set movies reader ratings meaningful lists movies database display list popular movies search result queried person year country

developed visual query interface visualizes relationship virtual reviewers recommendations 
visual virtual reviewers virtual reviewer visualized rectangle icon displays bar chart showing component ratio ratings characterize movies reviewers 
movie reviewer pointed mouse cursor virtual reviewer displays bar chart ratings pointed movie reviewers uv ratings pointed user movies mv seen 
bar charts characterize movies reviewers 
liking values give relevance movies reviewers viewpoint bar chart provides detailed relationships viewpoint 
example bar chars differentiate movies reviewers liking value movie reviewers uv give high ratings give low ratings movie reviewers uv give moderate ratings movie small group reviewers uv give high ratings give rating 
recommendation shows result recommendation virtual reviewer
