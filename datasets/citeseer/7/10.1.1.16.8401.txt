imagine agent obliged settle debt desires go holiday intends attend conference 
suppose believes afford finance activities decides pay checks settle debt 
unfortunately agent earn money habit buying expensive books 
runs debt short 
despite fact obligation desire intention believes ord finance activities decides time attend conference 
directly decision hears conference cancelled receives telephone call mother telling willing pay checks time 
agent happy decides go holiday 
agent friend obligation desire intention likewise believes afford finance activities 
contrast agent friend decides go holiday 
late arranging holiday travel agencies sold 
decides attend conference 
di erent situation agents obliged visit mothers desire go cinema believe simultaneously agent decides visit mother friend goes cinema

boid agent observes environment reacts means detectors ectors respectively 
component boid architecture process having input output behavior 
reason model input output behavior component components abstracted rule systems contains set defeasible rules 
components output mental attitude certain inputs represent conditional mental attitudes 
boid architecture modules distinguished goal generation module plan generation module 
goal generation module generates goals beliefs desires intentions obligations plan generation module generates sequences actions goals

boid architecture di ers procedural reasoning system prs developed bdi beliefs desires intention framework aspects 
di erence boid extends prs obligations additional component 
reason extension incorporate elements social level social commitments formalize example social agents social rationality 
second di erence related conditional nature mental attitudes boid 
fact mental attitude abstracted rule system containing defeasible rules 
contrast representation mental attitudes prs sets lists formula 
third di erence boid components represent mental attitudes processes having control mechanism 
contrast central control mechanism prs boid levels controls 
central control mechanism agent level coordinates activities components 
control mechanism component level determines output generated component receives input 
goals boid generated interactions agent mental attitudes contrast prs goals selected central control mechanism 
noticed component abstracted rule system specified propositional logical formulas form defeasible rules represented reading rule depends component occurs 
example rule obligation component represented read follows derived goal inconsistent derive obliged goal 
input output components represented sets logical formulas closed logical consequence 
thomason called extensions 
logic specifies extensions prioritized default logic takes ordering function parameter 
function constraints order derivation steps di erent components characterizes type agent 
briefly discuss boid conflict resolution mechanism explain ordering function define various agent types 
conflict resolution mechanism boid architecture goals generated calculation mechanism 
calculation starts set observations obs overridden initial sets default rules components assumes ordering function rules di erent components 
procedure determines sequence sets extensions 
element sequence set observations obs 
set extensions calculated set extensions checking extension rules extend extension 
case happens 
consequents applicable rules highest value added extension separately form distinct extensions operator th refers logical closure syntactic operation lit extracts set literals conjunction literals practice set extensions calculated calculated agent runs resources 
definition tuple obs called boid theory 
propositional logic extension set literals atom negation atom 
say rule strictly applicable extension th th th max set rules max strictly applicable exists strictly applicable extension procedure 
obs repeat exists strictly applicable max lit procedure calculate extensions model assign values rules rules component receive larger smaller values rules component 
implies rules components applied rules component applied 
basis idea define agent types 
course practical applications specified 
example agent may prefer rules rules conversely preferring rules rules 
mean basic idea dropped 
just means number components specified function defined accordingly 
component subdivided number subcomponents describe preference rules accordingly 
describe division important general idea agent type classification 
parameter may assign unique values rules components 
case boid calculation scheme apply iteration loop rule implies boid calculation scheme generates extension 
may assign identical integers di erent rules 
case imposes partial ordering rules 
boid calculation scheme apply rule iteration loop implies boid calculation scheme may generate set extensions 
example consider scenario agent believes non smoking area nsa 
intends smoke intends smoke non smoking area nsa 
define follows nsa nsa boid calculation scheme defined definition generates single extension nsa 
suppose defined follows nsa nsa assign identical integers intention rules boid calculation scheme generates extensions nsa nsa 
agent types presentation mental attitudes boid calculation scheme investigate type interactions mental attitudes arise boid architecture interactions classified 
principle fifteen types conflicts occur mentioned mental attitudes 
conflicts solved di erent ways 
explain different ways resolving conflicts modelled restricting order rule application boid calculation scheme 
argue restrictions specify di erent types boid agent introduce classification types boid agents 
examples boid types solutions conflict situation 
conflict resolution agent types main tasks deliberative agents solve possible conflicts mental attitudes 
principle fifteen di erent types conflicts may arise class classes 
dependent exact interpretation classes conflict types may interesting important 
distinguish general types conflicts internal external conflicts 
internal conflicts caused component external conflicts caused 
internal conflicts distinguished unary subtypes 
external conflicts distinguished binary conflict subtypes bo bi bd oi od id ternary conflict types bod bid oid conflict type boid 
example boid external conflict type situation agent intends go conference 
obligatory agent spend money conference 
particular agent pay cheap flight ticket stay better hotel agent pay expensive flight ticket stay budget hotel 
agent desires stay better hotel 
believes secretary booked expensive flight ticket 
examples conflicts 
conflict resolution type characterizes agent type considered order 
components goal generation module boid architecture possible orders 
consider orders belief component component 
reduces number possible orders 
examples conflict resolution beliefs follows 
conflict belief intention means intended action longer executed due changing environment 
beliefs overrule intention retracted 
derived consequences intention retracted 
course may allow intentions overrule beliefs results unrealistic behavior 
conflicts beliefs obligations desires need resolved 
observed thomason beliefs override desires thinking 
conflict intention obligation desire means want intended 
intentions override exactly property intentions introduced bring stability 
call intention reconsideration conflicts may resolved 
example intend go cinema am obliged visit mother go cinema reconsider intentions 
order string letters order representing agent type realistic agent specific agent types boid 
specific agent types known literature name 
note overloaded name boid way specific type agent general name agent architecture 
specific agent types beliefs override components represented constraint function resulting known agent type called realistic 
definition realistic agent type constraint function formulated follows simply specific function characterizes realistic boid types indicate extension calculated 
definition realistic boid agent starts observations calculates belief extensions iteratively applying belief rules 
belief rule applicable anymore component chosen applicable rule selected applied 
rule chosen component applied successfully belief component attended belief rules applied 
rule chosen component applicable component chosen 
rule components applicable process terminates fixed point reached extensions calculated 
agent types specified constraints function 
consider realistic agent types limit agent types subtypes realistic agent types 
known agent types represented follows 
boid called stable intentions overrule desires called selfish desires overrule intentions boid called social obligations overrule desires specific realistic agent types mentioned earlier subtypes known general realistic agent types 
agent types name possible 
relation realistic agent types forms lattice illustrated 
level hierarchy indicates generality agent types 
bottom lattice realistic agent type characterized number constraints function 
higher layer adds additional constraints resulting specific agent types 
second level stable social selfish agent types result fourth level mentioned specific unknown agent types boid result 
top lattice indicates adding additional constraint function results inconsistent ordering 
example section illustrate conflicts mental attitudes solved boid lattice structure agent types 
architecture giving example describes mental attitudes go washington dc go dc believe cheap rooms close conference site close 
go washington dc am obliged take cheap room 
go washington dc desire stay close conference site 
intend go washington dc 
example represented rules go dc close go dc close go dc close go dc go dc lets examine specific type social agent 
input agent empty 
extension calculation mechanism derive beliefs intentions resulting extension go dc social agent fourth rule higher priority fifth rule obligation rule applied 
results intermediate extension go dc extension fed back component triggers belief rule rule second belief rules applicable 
produces final extension go dc close extension denotes situation agent decided go washington dc takes cheap room close conference site social behavior 
exchange priority fourth fifth rules agent selfish agent 
rule applied obligation rule applied resulting final extension go dc close sending results back belief component di erence 
extension denotes situation agent decided go washington dc takes expensive room close conference site selfish behavior
