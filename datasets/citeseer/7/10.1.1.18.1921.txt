uni muenchen de uni erlangen de provides prosodic analysis called talk spoken german human computer interaction 
talk consists user utterances directed automatic speech processing system 
utterances mastered automatically far possible 
data collection smartkom project described problems consistent annotation talk discussed 
different forms talk distinguished compared speech directed system 
analysis includes various perceptual acoustic prosodic features 
clear differences distribution prominent accents phrase boundaries 
range turned relevant feature 
refined der tuition talk applied fulfills requirements consistent efficient annotation 

growing need exploring human computer interaction conversational point view 
automatic dialogue systems designed language facilities ideally enable natural dialogues user system 
order realize systems human linguistic behavior studied thoroughly context 
difficult task dialogue systems consists automatic processing user utterances part called coherent coordinated human computer dialogue 
phenomena barge fragmentary utterances different kinds repairs repetitions reformulations usually discussed context 
carry prosodic analysis hardly studied phenomenon talk spoken german human computer interaction 
talk special type conversation 
defined preliminary users utterances human computer interaction directed automatic speech processing system 
automatic recognition problematic user utterances crucial importance analysis users emotional state actual positive negative attitude chosen dialogue system 
automatic analysis states initiate implemented dialogue strategy prevents current dialogue breakdown 
believe early recognition increasing talk help detect critical phases human computer interaction 

smartkom corpus data study corpus created german research project smartkom 
project develop multimodal easy dialogue system simultaneously processes linguistic utterances gestures facial expressions user 
smartkom human computer interaction involves lifelike animated virtual communication assistant placed graphical display 
assistant communicates user carries certain instructions providing cinema information graphical display 
versions smartkom dialogue system planned including specific services public version airport train launches mobile version cars pedestrians version home office 
general smartkom ambitious goal recognize user states anger irritation joy surprise order react immediately misguided dialogues 
instance case user getting angry smartkom behave desired way system interrupt ask directly new instructions 
provide kind functionality smartkom able analyze user states anger automatically verbal non verbal behavior user 

wizard oz experiments institute phonetics speech communication university munich conducting wizard oz experiments aim collecting relevant empirical data design smartkom statistical training

various sessions recorded different cameras microphones

levels annotation recorded sessions experiments annotated manually various levels 
linguistic utterances broad orthographic transcription scheme 
scheme includes additional symbols information pauses 
prosodic events transcribed quite broadly essentially primary secondary accentuation marked phrase

checked times different persons annotation process 
furthermore smartkom gestures subjects interacting graphical display different user states session annotated 
actual user state referenced facial expression speech means state coded facial expression linguistic utterances user information sources 
conse quently annotation process developed mainly inspired second author consists different deliberately disconnected phases 
annotation phases realized separately different working groups 
phase produces called holistic annotation involving information sources 
case multimedia videos inspected containing exclusively facial display subjects acoustic utterances 
classification different user states grounded experimental set assumed states assigned subjective manner annotating person

third phase prosodic analysis linguistic utterances accomplished formal parameters syllable lengthening speech
