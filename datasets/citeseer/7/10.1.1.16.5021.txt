background related multimedia authoring systems long provided spatial temporal measurements means fragmenting media files 
systems authors apply numeric coordinates space time media files extract portions placement presentations 
enables example cropping image files include smaller images 
enables clipping audio video files shorter segments 
cropped image fragments typically rectangular shape 
spatial temporal fragmenting combined systems crop image played video dimensions crop change video played 
digital video editing tools long provided edit lists means reusing clips taken single video 
edit lists consist sequences time stamp pairs denoting clips source video 
enable source video files reused editing modifying copying segments smaller files 
different edit lists exist collection source video playing different cuts source video 
early structure approaches video clip sequencing includes video retrieval sequencing system 
handled levels video production 
process segments video structured semantically significant segments enable retrieving sequencing display different edit cuts 
provides retrieval segment sequences edited cut presentations 
emerging standard mpeg imposes hierarchical semantic structure digital media video audio allowing fragments labelled external 
locations fragments host files defined temporally spatially 
multimedia applications integrating fragments locate mpeg labels needing know spatial temporal coordinates 
furthermore spatial coordinates cropping temporal clips change progression clip defining classic user case car drives screen

furthermore standards provide means having link destinations spatial fragments 
smil attributes take temporal media object audio video file stream part starting particular times 
attributes assigned media object hyperlinking elements providing types temporal media fragment integration 
smil attribute performs particular kind temporal fragmenting removes top level repeats happen media file encoded animated gif

current nominal fragmenting smil attributes approach time subset nominal fragmenting media clip markers 
values marker follows uri locating timestamp media file 
uri begins comes name timestamp encoded media file 
example media clip markers

potentially extract timestamps third party mpeg files annotate host media files fragment comes 
smil media clip markers approach provide full nominal fragment 
clip media file terms time 
furthermore name locate fragment names locating bounding timestamps fragment 
nominal fragmenting directly implemented current uri fragment identifiers 
xml term fragment refers primarily fragment identifier portion uri part defines portion file referenced 
src href attributes xhtml smil svg 
current implementations formats fragment refer element named anchor unique identifier xml defined integrated media 
requires integrated media identified element encapsulate desired fragment 
resulting behavior discussed section 
current structural fragmenting xpointer clear emerging standard providing fragmented media fragmenting xpointer 
xpointer defines locations fragments xml code terms xml structure 
enables subcomponent xml document referenced xpointer xml elements unique identifiers

xpointer currently implemented language browsers xpointer values attributes processed 
xpointer separate fragment context explicitly leaves applications specify process fragment relation context 
xpointer released applications formalized fragments contexts handled differently 
small subset xpointer widely provides precedent 
xpointer specifies bare name xpointer value shortcut identifier ref erencing consistent fragment identifiers href attribute values xhtml

current fragment distinction target primary means web varying appearance piece document style specifications

type css selector pseudo class matches document portion manner location xml structure 
current version css recommendation css distinguish fragment version css currently development css 
css proposed new selectors pseudo class target applies particular style portions document targeted fragment identifier uri 
example significant pieces text highlighted typically yellow background distinguish 
piece css code uses target pseudo class define yellow background distinguishing fragments context 
code included css style sheet html document cause fragments highlighted yellow linked integrated presentations 
target background color yellow display fragment visually distinct illustrated

current context removal css css remove fragment context presentation 
css select context combining target pseudo class pseudo class introduces negation pseudo class 
css apply selected context style effectively removes display display property value

important characteristic uri data integrating document communicated network server

systems may instruct server perform extraction possible 
results fragment transferred network reducing network traffic

fragment locating information put uri put xml structure possibility performing fragment extraction server lowering bandwidth requirements 
benefits putting fragment locating information uri
