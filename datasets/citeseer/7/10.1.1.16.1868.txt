problem complex common settings receivers data trusted lost packets retransmitted 
source authentication schemes multicast suggested past schemes satisfactorily efficient prominent parameters 
proposed efficient scheme tesla initial loose time synchronization sender receivers followed delayed release keys sender 
proposes substantial modifications improvements tesla 
modification allows receivers authenticate packets soon arrive tesla requires buffering packets receiver side provides delayed authentication 
modifications improve scalability scheme reduce space overhead multiple instances increase resistance denial service attacks 
growth commercialization internet simultaneous transmission data multiple receivers prevalent mode communication 
transmitted data streamed considerable bandwidth 
avoid having send data separately receiver multicast routing protocols proposed deployed typically ip layer 
examples include 
underlying principle multicast communication data packet sent source reaches number receivers 
securing multicast communication introduces number difficulties encountered trying se cure unicast communication 
see taxonomy multicast security concerns solutions 
major concern source authentication allowing receiver ensure received data authentic originates source modified way receivers data trusted 
providing source authentication multicast communication focus 
simply deploying standard point point authentication mechanism appending message authentication code packet computed shared key provide source authentication case multicast 
problem receiver shared key forge data impersonate sender 
consequently natural look solutions asymmetric cryptography prevent attack digital signature schemes 
signing data packet provides source authentication high overhead terms time sign verify terms bandwidth 
schemes proposed mitigate overhead amortizing single signature packets 
schemes fully satisfactory terms bandwidth processing time especially setting transmission lossy data packets may arrive 
schemes amortize digital signature multiple data packets serious denial ofservice attack usually possible attacker floods receiver bogus packets supposedly containing strong signature 
signature verification computationally expensive receiver overwhelmed verifying signatures 
approach providing source authentication uses symmetric cryptography specifically message authentication codes macs delayed disclosure keys sender

description tesla improvements apply schemes 
sketch points 
tesla receiver buffer packets sender discloses corresponding key receiver authenticates packets 
may delay delivering information application may cause storage problems generates vulnerability denial service dos attacks receiver flooding bogus packets 
propose method allows receivers authenticate packets immediately arrival reducing need buffering receiver side particular reduces susceptibility type dos attacks 
improvement comes price extra hash packet plus buffering sender side 
believe buffering sender side reasonable acceptable buffering receiver side 
particular susceptible type dos attacks 
propose methods alleviate type dos attacks 
methods receiver buffers packets tesla 

operating environment heterogenous network delay times different receivers tesla authenticates packet multiple keys different keys different disclosure delay times 
results larger overhead processing time bandwidth 
propose method achieving functionality different receivers authenticate packets different delays moderate increase overhead packet 

tesla sender needs perform authenticated time synchronization individually receiver 
may scale especially cases receivers wish join multicast group synchronize sender time 
synchronization involves costly public key operation 
propose method uses single public key operation time unit regardless number time synchronizations performed time unit 
reduces cost synchronizing receiver practically cost setting simple unauthenticated connection 

explore time synchronization issues greater depth describe direct indirect time synchronization 
method receiver synchronizes time directly sender method sender receiver synchronize time time synchronization server 
cases give detailed analysis choose key disclosure delay crucial parameter tesla 

tesla assumes members joined group synchronized sender transmission starts 
reality receivers may wish join transmission started furthermore receivers may wish receive transmission immediately perform time synchronization 
propose methods enable functionalities 
methods allow receiver join fly ongoing session allow receivers synchronize time authenticate packets

concurrent tesla instances section space optimization technique case sender uses multiple tesla instances stream 
choosing disclosure delay involves tradeoff 
receivers low network delay welcome short key disclosure delays translates short authentication delay 
unfortunately receivers long network delay operate short disclosure delay packets violate security condition authenticated 
conversely long disclosure delay suit long delay receivers causes unnecessarily long authentication delay receivers short network delay 
solution multiple instances tesla different disclosure delays simultaneously receiver decide disclosure delay instance 
simple approach concurrent tesla instances treat tesla instance independently key chain instance 
problem approach extra tesla instance causes extra space overhead packet 
instance requires bytes packet bit key disclosure bit mac value instances results bytes space overhead packet 
new optimization reduces space overhead concurrent instances 
main idea independent key chain tesla instance key chain different key schedule instances 
basic scheme works follows 
tesla instances stream share time interval duration key chain 
key key chain associated corresponding time interval disclosed assume sender uses instances tesla denote tesla instance different disclosure delay mac key schedule derived key schedule shifted time intervals key dis denote mac key closure schedule 
instance time interval derive hmac note hmac pseudo random function key derivation construction tesla see section 
fact keys instance derived pseudo random function tesla protocol uses instance 
reason generating different independent keys instance prevent attack attacker moves mac value instance instance allow claim data sent different interval 
approach generating independent keys prevents attack 
compute mac value packet time interval sender computes mac value instance append mac message chunk values particular instance disclosure delay sender key mentioned mac computation 
shows example tesla instances key disclosure time intervals intervals 
lowest line keys shows key disclosure schedule key disclosed time interval 
middle top line keys shows key schedule second instance respectively key compute mac packets time interval instance 
technique sender need disclose key chain matter instances concurrently 
disclosed key bytes long stream concurrent instances technique save bytes packet drastic saving particular small packets

particularly useful case satellite broadcast 
delayed time synchronization interesting relaxation time synchronization requirement assume receiver clock drift negligible period time receiver receive data stream sender doing time synchronization authenticate data time synchronization 
receiver needs store arrival time packet evaluate security condition performed time synchronization 
highly useful applications example router tesla authenticate messages victim authenticate routers ip markings wants trace attacker performing approximate time synchronization router 
determining key disclosure delay important parameter determine tesla key disclosure delay short disclosure delay cause packets violate security condition cause packet drop long disclosure delay causes long authentication delay 
note choice disclosure delay affect security system important performance factor 
describe new method choose disclosure delay particular show follows rtt reasonable upper bound round trip time receiver sender case direct time synchro choose interval duration 
case indirect time synchronization choose sum sender receiver time synchronization error reasonable upper bound network delay packet traveling sender receiver
