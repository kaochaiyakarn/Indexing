morphology branch linguistics studies describes words formed language includes inflection derivation compounding 
inflection characterizes changes word form accompany case gender number tense person mood voice 
derivational analysis reduces surface forms base form derived includes changes part speech 
xerox linguists developed lexical database english languages analyze generate inflectional derivational morphology 
inflectional database reduces surface word form dictionary follows ffl nouns singular ex

derivational database reduces surface forms stems related original form semantics 
example government stems govern department reduced depart forms different meanings
