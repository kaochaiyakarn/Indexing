discussion shown proposition formal definition risk agora enables defeasibility scientific claims 
system operationalizes normative principles conduct scientific discourses section 
addition shown propositions system satisfies certain proposed normative principles dialogue reasonable participants various hitchcock principles rational mutual inquiry rules discourse ethics 
happens real scientific debates argument may claim proceed argument grounds inferences establish degree support consequences 
believe risk agora expressive formalism representation scientific arguments 
propositions proved section show inference defeasible truth status claims agora certain desirable properties 
particular probability new evidence pertaining claim agora small probability correspondingly high current agora valuation reflects long run position 
currently exploring number refinements agora 
firstly believe agora syntax readily extended facilitate discussion agreement participants regarding internal structure debates example discussing theoretical questions experimental ones ascertaining validity experiments discussing implications extension formalism enable agora participants give operational effect hitchcock principles staging manner consistent principle 
may value extending agora syntax permit participant discussion modality dictionaries presently assumed agreed participants 
formal language arguments acceptability rules inference may conducted 
secondly william rehg demonstrated rationality incorporation non deductive rhetorical devices speech appeals emotions dialectical argument decision making seek means incorporate devices agora 
example scientific domains respected senior scientists believed community possess uncommon intuition insight ad arguments arguments authority appropriate non deductive argument schema inclusion agora 
novel argumentation system chris reed example allows modeling rhetorical devices context 
secondly modern societies scientific risk assessment forms part process determine legal regulations imposed production sale chemicals involved 
debate issues viewed deliberative dialogue aimed deciding 
commenced task modelling dialogues specifying different types speech acts appropriate environmental regulatory domain 
draws habermas philosophy communicative action sought understand people collaborate rationally achieve common understanding situation collective action 
speech acts relevant dialogues include statements value revealing speaker preferences value assignments statements connection asserting existence relationship different parties dispute statements obligation asserting legal ethical obligations part participants 
implement system incorporating utterances coherent formal model deliberation dialogue required akin formal models negotiation dialogues developed persuasion dialogues developed walton krabbe 
david hitchcock proposed formal model deliberation dialogue drawing philosophy argumentation harald 
agora deliberative context require incorporation values projected consequences development appropriate qualitative decision theory topics received attention ai 
example developed argumentation formalisms articulation manipulation statements qualitative value part calculi qualitative decision making 
believe risk agora number potential benefits 
firstly section argumentation formalism enables qualitative representation epistemic uncertainty coherently incorporate multiple types evidence support intersubjective agreement participants 
carcinogenic risk domain typically features quantitative formalisms 
secondly articulating precisely arguments assert gaps knowledge weaknesses arguments identified readily 
identification prioritize bio medical research efforts particular chemical 
thirdly exploring consequences claims risk agora serve social function making explicit knowledge may latent
