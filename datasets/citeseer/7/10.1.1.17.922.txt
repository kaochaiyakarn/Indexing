large small displays available person manner change 
current graphical user interfaces premise display size sheets share display applications application remain display created 
effects assumptions far reaching 
important consequence user perspective window system provide window manager help user manage larger set windows fit display 
unfortunately existing window systems inappropriate new environments 
example microcomputer window systems microsoft windows microsoft apple macintosh desktop apple require programs run locally 
allows quite responsive unsuitable distributed environment 
popular networked window system scheifler gettys provide sufficiently general layer abstraction applications window system allow windows moved displays type mention moving displays different sizes capabilities 
various attempts modify rectify problems entirely satisfactory 
large allow windows moved virtually identical displays modifying applications transparent window mobility difficult achieve 
window systems nextstep nextstep news sun trestle manasse nelson provide layer abstraction applications window system address requirements moving windows significantly different displays 
developing suitable window system providing capabilities existing systems significant challenge 
environment management previous section discussed problems encountered attempting current windowing systems ubiquitous computing virtual environment 
prime motivations trying existing window system inventing new appropriate desire support huge number existing applications feiner 
adapting windowing system new environments issues addressed involve window management 
screen real estate premium currently 
surplus real estate spread hundreds devices 
users need help organizing windows small crowded display need help organizing finding orders magnitude objects scattered environment 
need extend notion window management environment management 
simple problem current window managers part force users position windows manually 
automatic positioning windows nontrivial displays 
ubiquitous computing augmented reality potentially far display real estate allowing environment managers freedom reasonable choices object placement 
augmented reality potential overlaid object block interest display person feiner 
environment manager help users avoid problems moving existing virtual objects necessary 
different approaches window management needed pen interfaces 
example piles metaphor explored mander salomon wong mander displays set documents small stacked pile 
meaningful representation set documents folder typical interface macintosh conveys existence group documents approximate size contents relative order 
piles metaphor takes advantage ability form recognize patterns complicated data 
different document piles soon take meaning owner virtue shape size need manual labeling 
learning disciplines user interface community general needs pay attention happening disciplines 
increasingly important user interfaces intelligent attempt user 
learn disciplines older mature 
continued increases compute power improvements interaction devices readily take advantage experience 
example learn animators motion blur squash stretch multimedia user interfaces techniques chang ungar perceptual cognitive psychologists study people understand sensory phenomena architects landscape designers structure real spaces effective occupants 
integration hypermedia meyrowitz haan stresses importance making hypertext capabilities available operating system separate hypertext applications 
need extend notion universal hypertext linking possible link arbitrary physical virtual objects 
feiner macintyre haupt solomon feiner developed prototype augmented reality system allows hypertextual links created windows physical objects environment 
example possible automatically find notes various books shelf attach reminders people locations similar way calendar programs attach dates times attach hypertextual links follow room 
authoring authoring material individual medium difficult time consuming creating quality multimedia document requires expertise individual media skill making media effectively 
fact effort takes author multimedia document rarely mentioned attributed solely deficiencies editor process 
research direction addresses difficulties automated design multimedia goal explored comet feiner mckeown wip wahlster knowledge multimedia generation projects 
systems ai techniques create explanatory text graphics fulfill set input goals coordinate material generated different media making possible generated text refer generated graphics mckeown 
authoring harder media include full set possibilities available dynamic virtual environment 
feiner karma feiner address different aspects creating virtual environments automatically 
designs desktop virtual environments visualizations multivariate data account criteria need interactive responsiveness 
example controls amount time display takes render varying resolution representations data calculated displayed 
component karma guides users equipment maintenance task creating graphics overlay user view physical world 
karma design take account position orientation user head objects documented information presents redesigned user moves 
example annotation may appear object annotated physically obscured object 
major challenge develop robust virtual environment design systems handle broader range media production environment including temporal media animation speech 
agents situations design multimedia presentation completely automated agents proposed useful framework development tools assist creation presentation information 
example agents assist collection information monitoring electronic newswires interesting articles roaming computer networks gather information remote databases 
charged carrying tasks part owner 
agents provide assistance video editing processing unannotated footage recognize cuts pans zooms find shots including participant location ueda 
suggested previous section full set output possibilities available dynamic virtual ubiquitous computing environments greatly complicates multimedia presentation 
merely selecting output device available displays possibly widely varying characteristics non trivial task 
environmental knowledge available ubiquitous computing environment display agents automatically select displays output migrate information displays 
agents assist organizing information single display augmented reality overlay large wall sized display 
capturing journaling personal experience capturing journaling personal experience vannevar bush bush suggested scientists someday wear small head mounted cameras microphones allow selectively photograph things interest inspecting enter notes annotations worked labs 
technology possible extend vision capturing user see hear experience 
example tiny pair cameras microphones embedded frames pair glasses 
improvements compression techniques decreases memory cost size eventually idea feasible 
raises myriad issues index sort edit search lifetime recorded experience 
collaboration virtual environments ubiquitous computing raise additional issues addressed current research collaboration cscw 
particular support collaborating users different display interaction devices paradigms mobile participants 
example collaborating users may hmd may hand held pda 
ubiquitous computing devices provide sharable high resolution displays display shared information augmented reality application 
necessary support private views information multi user virtual worlds 
example shared presence means able see representation user user virtual environment able see 
classical shared pointer metaphor user view shared information different 
privacy privacy issues ubiquitous computing virtual environments significant 
tracked go volume data collected staggering 
weiser discusses implications wearing active badges potential interested person see long spends room building weiser 
active badges track user granularity room high resolution trackers potentially know user doing time 
possibilities employer information pleasant 
implementors need pay special attention ensure privacy maintained 
weiser suggests combination technological social solutions best 
example employers currently video cameras computer activity monitoring watch employees desire general social legal climate discourages technically feasible measures 
technical solution ensuring privacy ubiquitous computing environment succeed seriously hampering utility system current attitudes employee personal attitudes adjust appropriately 
global activity monitoring individuals may useful obvious ways automatic forwarding phone calls 
interesting applications exist 
example automatic diary generated records user area day newman 
easier fill time sheets remember involved meetings check went cafeteria 
unfortunately check see talked way back cafeteria innocent intentions information security system place prevent 
approaches uniform global availability taken provide information 
example positional information available physically near talked hallway able look back remember 
necessarily able find meeting 
raises possibility people pooled information reconstruct life 
underscores weiser point technical solutions privacy ease electronic information pooled requires problem addressed socially 
imagine location information service paying people contact information collect pooling information selling willing pay 
privacy requirements raise interesting interface database questions easily specify know parts huge volume information collected day 
query meet way back cafeteria afternoon stated answered light possibly complicated combination public private data 
multimedia user interfaces privacy issue addressed technology eavesdropping confidential information 
current interfaces provide way prevent see display reading 
example way working public place protect eavesdroppers 
easy read display person sitting front plane train 
augmented reality provides solution problem 
displaying virtual image wearer hmd see possibility reading shoulder eliminated 
collaborative environment described previous section selected parts personal information augments public displays kept confidential 
ubiquitous computing provide straightforward solutions cases 
example document group discussion confidential employee performance evaluation automatically close employee inappropriate viewer entered room 
surveyed state art virtual environments ubiquitous computing user interface paradigms shape computing 
tried tro show complement provide new capabilities multimedia user interfaces suggested set issues multimedia researchers explore 
paradigms differ prevalent current multimedia systems part new hardware technologies displays interaction devices case virtual environments large numbers computers integrated environment ubiquitous computing 
furthermore paradigms impose significant additional requirements operating systems networks current desktop multimedia applications 
example virtual environments involve transmission information generated trackers 
relatively small amount information comparison digital video latency requirements stricter multiple users interact effectively 
comparison ubiquitous computing require high bandwidth extremely short distances resulting extremely high aggregate bandwidth entire network 
consequence new trends assumptions multimedia support systems reexamined 
range current user interface metaphors video enhanced wimp approach current computing infrastructure relatively static network configurations
