context domains context knowledge acquisition knowledge acquisition difficult time consuming task 
difficulty raises experts report reach decision 
consequence decision acquired context experts justify decision correct specific context 
context knowledge acquisition generally considered building system system 
main approach followed knowledge acquisition community 
example walther describe context definition language call model protege ii system 
model architecture associates explicit data model reusable module tool libraries 
data model describes externally visible aspects module defines context ontology reusing module contains necessary information defining module role module assembly process 
context ontology differ significantly knowledge representation system context contains set concepts called schema frame structure describes basic terms encode knowledge ontology 
furthermore context contains set constraints restrict manner instances concepts may created combined 
addition basic functions role context ontologies places number requirements representation language 
encoding knowledge part task hand alternative leads knowledge acquisition 
knowledge encoded system needed context 
contextualizing knowledge acquisition process helps ensure relevant knowledge put knowledge base doesn know really needed design process
