supposed notions permission closest empowered 
pointed makinson makinson theorists long aware notions equivalent 
enrich logical language adding modality express idea agent ability practical possibility act notion institutionalised power remain 
makinson cites passage distinguished explicitly legal power ii physical power needed carry acts necessary exercise legal power iii permission carry acts 
makinson adds illustrative example consider case priest certain religion permission instructions issued authorities marry people religion promise bring children religion 
may power marry couple absence promise sense goes ahead performs counts valid act marriage rules church priest may subject severe penalty having performed 
op 
cit clearly case priest empowered marry couple permitted 
similarly may imagine circumstances practically possible priest marry couple say sick empowered 
having practical possibility act necessary condition empowered 
position disagrees lindahl see especially lindahl pp suggested concept practical possibility analysing legal power provided cases legal mere physical power explicit concern practical possibility create normative states 
view contrast agent may practical possibility create normative state affairs empowered 
consider point shall return discussion call transfer problem agent may practical possibility see couple married getting authorised priest conduct empowered marry 
short practical ability perform acts way create lead normative daily telegraph vi contains report religious services conducted roman catholic left marry 
report canon law retain powers forbidden exercise state affairs necessary sufficient condition empowered 
similar objections raised proposed formulation legal power allen saxon see allen saxon allen saxon 
outside domains state church law may easily find examples illustrating distinctions concepts triad 
departmental head may empowered purchase new equipment permitted equipment costing consults finance office 
failure consult purchase necessarily invalidate purchase order 
member academic staff may empowered sign write accepted student supplementary reading list student demand examined works list may obligation academic staff member exercise power reading list properly representative subject area examination 
power exercised violation obligation staff member empowered student rights regard examination 
examples clear agent concerned may empowered permitted necessarily having practical possibility act 
reason believe distinction permission institutionalised power important understanding notion authorisation 
may suggested authorisation ambiguous regard pair 
say agent authorised mean granted permission
