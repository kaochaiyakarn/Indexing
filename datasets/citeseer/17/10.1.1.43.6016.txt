major problem arises trying reconstruct scene input trying determine object looks new point view 
think billboards providing crude solution problem approximate appearance object new viewpoint appearance initial viewpoint 
billboards objects look approximately directions trees flowers telephone poles roughly drawn characters 
assumption approximate radial symmetry hold case house say billboards look odd visually disturbing 
appear proceedings different approach may success cases 
advantage system teddy example certain types objects teddy produce fairly accurate approximations objects appearances novel viewpoints 
constrain camera user views objects viewpoints system plausibly reconstruct object appearance 
approach taken dorsey mcmillan system incorporated certain extent harold 
harold camera constrained stay constant height ground exception optional flying controls system task slightly easier don appearances objects 
drawback billboards maintain fixed relationship camera moves 
example large billboards close may intersect viewer moves billboards rotate 
produce surprising visual effects 
algorithm choosing center rotation partially addresses problem bridges cases approach handles particularly 
interface harold obviously modal systems sketch teddy 
clear drawback 
notion modes suggestive rigid may somewhat awkward users billboard mode perform operations related billboards drawing sky 
obvious direction incorporate techniques systems sketch teddy curve system 
clear cases clearly nontrivial task 
system potentially powerful modeling tool creating visually rich environments 
types brushes clear richer mechanism creating drawings useful 
features ordinary paint programs conceivably incorporated certain issues arise context system arise paint programs 
example flood filling collection strokes billboard simple flood filling region image may gaps strokes visible billboard sufficiently far away 
naive flood fill unexpectedly flow outside intended area 
interesting problems investigate 
directions exploring include extending drawing metaphor allow user draw animations river appears flowing rain appears falling 
conceivable take allow user draw simple behaviors creating interactive environments 
possible extensions rendering system adding automatic level detail strokes far away improvements efficiency system incorporating non rendering styles described
