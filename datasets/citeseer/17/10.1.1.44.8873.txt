definition states finite set possible states world 
agent pair sets actions called respectively agent set local states actions 
pw states function describing set world states consistent local state 
pw satisfies conditions pw pw iff subset states exists pw state set states describes possible state world agent environment 
description tell internal state agent content registers internal states described elements set local states 
intuitively local states correspond agent possible states information knowledge see fagin rosenschein

agent starts initial state information chooses possible actions current state information local state function called agent policy see protocol fagin strategy luce raiffa 
policy maps state information agent action

exponential naive representation policies maximin representation requires logm delta delta space max actions states ju gamma representing binary decisions section presents representation theorems maximin agents possible actions 
start describing basic property maximin representable policies 
definition say policy closed union implies states 
suppose agent take action local state local state agent considers possible worlds possible pw pw pw 
agent policy closed unions choose action example suppose agent instructed bring coffee knows weather cold warm knows weather warm hot 
agent knows weather cold warm hot bring coffee policy closed unions 
sounds perfectly reasonable 
consider example alex likes swiss chocolate dislikes 
finds unmarked chocolate bar decide eat 
policy knows chocolate swiss american eat knows bar swiss french eat 
alex policy closed unions eat bar knows swiss french american
