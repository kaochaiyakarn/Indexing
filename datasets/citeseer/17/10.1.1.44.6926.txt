today computer communication technology creates opportunity easy access information sources opportunity support complex information retrieval tasks 
emerging technology fulfil promises information available needs easy accessible 
implies system allow users formulate information needs naturally intuitive manner 
believe human dialogues provide best model candidate systems 
important stress imply systems mimic human dialogues minute detail 
basic principles dialogues supported connectedness consecutive communicative acts free choice expression semantic syntactic level frequent abbreviated expressions rely verbal non verbal context interpretation 
viewed perspective multi modal information systems dialogue systems strict sense verbal spoken written input output channel 
multi modal information system dialogue system modalities integrated possible communicative actions part going dialogue 
user freely decide interact system answer spoken question pointing map verbal answer 
system architecture point view means modalities dialogue acts performed utilising modality need handled

total subjects participated study 
subjects divided groups corresponding knowledge local buses linkoping 
main study subjects asked answer questionnaire 
pre questionnaire recorded subjects background post questionnaire emphasised subjects attitudes system 
study subject user interface conditions multi modal interaction traditional interaction 
subjects randomly assigned start condition switch 
subjects short prototype solve different scenarios condition 
investigation showed multi modal interaction extent efficient traditional interaction 
users fewer errors completed task fewer steps way map easier multi modal interaction 
task completion time types interaction differ 
investigation showed users weak domain knowledge better supported multi modal interaction traditional interaction vice versa users domain knowledge 
multi modal user interfaces provide users means interaction users choose means efficient purpose 
investigations provided implications refinement multi modal user interface 
example see indications users needed support elaborated dialogue system 
claim efficiency important feature multi modal interaction 
users subjective experience dialogue reliability taken account design system

design data wizard oz investigations written interaction information seeking domains lead interaction quite simple structured terms ir segments sequences utterances starting initiative response 
questions fairly simple majority analysed asking properties objects conversely asking objects satisfying list properties 
adjacent segments simple ways complexity may vary domain 
dialogue manager controls interaction means dialogue grammar holds information needed manager generator model dialogue spatial module database timetable temporal module system information geographical information specification forms domain model conceptual model structure coordinator internal dialogue knowledge dialogue interpreter overview system

information specification forms principles dialogue management system worked information retrieval applications user initiative normally specifies object properties detail background system access 
case timetable information requests 
order handle timetable information requests correctly variety parameters departure arrival time day specified background system accessed 
furthermore empirical investigations local bus timetable information requests identified number different user information needs 
common called trip information occurs user needs know particular day day travel point town bus 
common information need called route information user wants information bus routes go point 
need handle various information needs follow usual approach having information specification task integrated dialogue management 
model extended information specification forms isf model information pieces needed access background system various user tasks 
isf assumes slot filler structure attributes reflecting information needed properly access background system 
similar called task models spoken dialogue systems model set information pieces necessary perform task providing timetable information cf 

users provide notion task confusing term describe different tasks user tasks system tasks 
term information specification form isf 
discussed 
piece information point discourse important allow user behaviour cf 
view 
information interpreter current dialogue modelled dialogue tree instance isf corresponding user task associated current node dialogue tree 
isf see information missing dialogue manager generates meaningful follow questions underspecified information requests 
sub dialogues generated inspecting isf asking additional information required fulfil task 
controlled dialogue grammar enhanced consider information isf 
knowledge sources utilised dialogue manager controlling interaction conceptual domain dialogue models consulted needed 
domain model structure world dialogue conceptual model contains general information concepts relationships particular domain 

representation domain knowledge requests information passed dialogue manager knowledge ordinator isf trip route fully specified 
task knowledge coordinator decide knowledge sources consult integrate information received return dialogue manager 
important easily looked difference domain local bus traffic commonly worked rail information systems users natural way expressing departure arrival locations rarely official names bus stops 
locations described street area names locative expressions close library pointing clicking map 
reason representation reasoning geographical domain necessity 
rail traffic information systems explicit model temporal domain cf 
knowledge geographical domain implicit lies lexicon grammar 
multi modal dialogue system local bus traffic information elaborated domain model supports spatial temporal reasoning needed 
input system temporal spatial descriptions ambiguous vague 
vague qualitative descriptions concepts mapped quantitative exact information needed searching timetable database 
accomplished utilising domain knowledge 
approach represent domain knowledge modules spatial reasoning module temporal reasoning module see 
spatial module utilises geographical information system described 
apart mapping vague information precise descriptions domain model utilised provide dialogue manager information clarification requests inconsistencies input missing information needed 
illustrated example 
know travel hospital linkoping 
utterance recognised request route information phrase hospital departure location linkoping arrival location 
dialogue manager fills slots isf passes request knowledge ordinator 
knowledge ordinator consults spatial module tries map locations sets bus stops 
spatial reasoner discovers hospital ambiguous location tries disambiguate information 
spatial information departure location clarification needed 
knowledge ordinator passes information dialogue manager poses question user 
system shows list hospitals hospitals 


points university hospital list new information integrated old dialogue manager extends isf new information departure location 
new request sent knowledge ordinator consults spatial module 
time spatial module succeeds tries disambiguate location place hospital 
place referred user mapped bus stops near place 
ambiguous mapped nearby bus stops 
sets bus stops returned knowledge ordinator turn temporal module timetable database access 
resulting route information returned knowledge ordinator dialogue manager consults generator timetable user 

modal dialogue system different system uses input output modality 
requires careful examination communicative acts different modalities form coherent dialogue interpretation act modality previous dialogue acts different modalities 
described basic architecture multi modal dialogue system satisfies requirements 
described detail aspects system design interface domain knowledge sources spatial temporal reasoning 
areas empirical investigations utilised reveal necessary requirements impact design implementation system discussed
