recovery lsm tree new entries inserted component lsm tree rolling merge processes migrates entry information successively larger components takes place memory buffered multi page blocks 
memory buffered changes resistant system failure written disk 
faced classical recovery problem reconstruct taken place memory crash occurs memory lost 
mentioned chapter don need create special logs recover index entries newly created records transactional insert logs new records written sequential log file normal course events simple matter treat insert logs normally contain field values rid inserted record placed logical base reconstructing index entries 
new approach recover index built system recovery algorithm may effect extending time storage reclamation transactional history insert logs take place minor consideration 
demonstrate recovery lsm tree index important carefully define form checkpoint demonstrate know start sequential log file apply successive logs deterministically replicate updates index need recovered 
scheme follows 
checkpoint requested time complete merge steps operation node locks released postpone new entry inserts lsm tree checkpoint completes point create checkpoint actions 
write contents component known disk location entry inserts merge steps continue deferred 
flush disk dirty memory buffered nodes disk components 
create special checkpoint log information log sequence number lsn inserted indexed row time disk addresses roots components location merge cursors various components current information dynamic allocation new multi page blocks 
checkpoint information placed disk resume regular operations lsm tree 
event crash subsequent restart checkpoint located saved component loaded back memory buffered blocks components needed continue rolling merges 
logs starting lsn lsn read memory associated index entries entered lsm tree 
time checkpoint positions disk components containing indexing information recorded component directories starting roots locations known checkpoint log 
information wiped writes multi page disk blocks writes new locations disk subsequent checkpoints multi page blocks unnecessary 
recover logs inserts indexed rows place new entries component rolling merge starts overwriting multi page blocks written checkpoint recovering new index entries inserted row indexed recovery complete 
recovery approach clearly works drawback possibly large pause various disk writes take place checkpoint process 
pause terribly significant write component disk short period resume inserts component rest writes disk complete simply result longer usual latency period index entries newly inserted merged larger disk components 
checkpoint complete rolling merge process catch missed 
note piece information mentioned checkpoint log list current information dynamic allocation new multi page blocks 
case crash need recovery multi page blocks available dynamic disk storage allocation algorithm 
clearly difficult problem fact difficult problem garbage collecting fragmented information block solved :10.1.1.117.5365
detail recovery directory information 
note rolling merge progresses time multi page block higher level directory node brought disk emptied immediately assigned new disk position case checkpoint occurs emptying completed remaining buffered information forced disk 
means directory entries pointing emptying nodes immediately corrected point new node locations 
similarly immediately assign disk position newly created nodes directory entries tree able point immediately appropriate position disk 
point need take care directory nodes containing pointers lower level nodes buffered rolling merge buffered way necessary modifications quickly checkpoint held waiting os correct directories 
furthermore checkpoint occurs multi page blocks read back memory buffers continue rolling merge blocks involved assigned new disk position directory pointers subsidiary nodes corrected 
sounds great deal reader recall additional necessary number pointers involved probably block buffered 
furthermore changes amortized large number merged nodes assuming checkpoints taken frequently keep recovery time growing minutes implies minutes checkpoints 

cost performance comparisons access methods introductory example considered tree acct id timestamp index history file common disk access method commercial systems 
wish show disk indexing structure consistently gives superior performance 
motivate statement argue follows 
assume dealing arbitrary indexing structure 
recall calculated number entries acct id timestamp index assuming generating entries second day period accumulation hour days 
index entries bytes length bytes acct id bytes timestamp bytes history row rid implies gbytes entries kbyte pages index wasted space 
subject change specific choice index method 
tree leaf level certain amount wasted space upper level directory nodes extendible hash table somewhat different amount wasted space directory nodes structures contain gbytes entries calculated 
perform insert new index entry index structure need calculate page entry inserted sure page memory resident 
question naturally arises newly inserted entries generally placed arbitrary position gbytes index entries 
answer classical method structures 
definition 
say index structure disk access method property continuum structure indexing scheme provides immediate placement newly inserted index entry ultimate order key value entries 
recall successive transactions tpc benchmark application acct id values generated random possible values 
definition new entry insert acct id timestamp index placed pretty random position pages entries exist 
tree example accumulated entries contain average entries acct id presumably entry acct id distinct timestamp 
new entry insert placed right entries acct id leaves points insert randomly chosen certainly implies new insert random pages existing entries 
extendible hashing scheme contrast new entries order calculated hash value acct id timestamp key value clearly placement new entry sequence entries equally 
pages minimum number gbytes entries continuum structure sit inserts second page structure accessed new insert seconds minute rule keep pages buffered 
consider larger nodes hold entries bounded disorder file provides advantage greater frequency cost memory buffer node greater effects cancel
