interaction history day dozens different ways conscious reflection think natural

term history rich object association records interaction people digital information derives hill jim hollan 
taken initial insight expanded theoretical framework allows talk wide variety history systems 
section gives basic theoretical framework 
describe tools built enable history rich navigation complex information spaces particularly world wide web 
describe experiment having people tools controlled task discuss ongoing expanding improving tools 
interaction history framework developed framework talking interaction history 
framework presents properties characterize interaction history systems 
goal framework bound space possible interaction history systems give designers systems guidance things important building history rich interfaces 
major properties describe space 
property versus urban planning social anthropology words describe closeness relationship people spaces 
consider proximity function physical distance cognitive distance person space 
space felt users transparent signs structures easily understood 
people feel close part space 
conversely spaces opaque users 
signals go unseen usually people space lack required background knowledge translate comprehend experience 
feel close bedroom far away experience certain distance sleep guest bedroom 
interaction history systems may relate users take advantage users past experiences knowledge 
example emacs mode line history noted cvs completely know cvs concurrent version control system uses numerical markers distinguish successive versions source file 
property active versus passive interaction history passive recorded available conscious effort usually product everyday objects 
conversely think leaving record creating active history element 
active passive distinction concerned user mental state relationship history rich objects 
common example distinction web browser software netscape navigator 
history go list passive history recorded user browses bookmarks favorites list active history user think may want return location 
challenge history rich computer systems find ways allow interaction history passively collected necessary users constantly thrown cognitive state necessary getting tasks done 
property rate form change history moves forward building interactions take place 
process history builds 
interaction history fades 
challenges history rich interfaces deciding deal 
just complete video playback meeting usually useful summary total accumulation history summarized observed quickly 
realworld example patient charts hospitals 
charts annotated added different personnel different situations time physician able come room pick chart understand essential facts patient current state glance

property degree degree interaction history part history rich objects 
history may inseparable object flight worn stairs may completely separate records stolen art 
history rich interface decide closely link objects interaction history information 
digital data retain history information choose keep record information captured displayed tools create explicitly purpose display systems built existing tools example mode line modification emacs described 
tools built display interaction history information described section 
property personal versus social history intimate person done 
social done 
tools focus personal histories example bookmarks web browsers allow users revisit sites noted 
group ries knowledge repositories shared digital libraries rare believe valuable problem solving tasks collaborative nature 
primary benefits interaction history give newcomers benefit done past 
fact slogan footprints project benefit experience preferably property kind information infinite variety kinds interaction history information captured 
kinds information important large degree dependent task observer trying accomplish 
possibly characterize kinds information available focus uses interaction history put 
categorize kind information available loosely 
knowing done useful users searching value particularly clutter need 
particularly helpful novices lack kind practice helps know reasonable computer system 
knowing done give guidance process directing task journey 
knowing done important reasons doing things friends sociability doing things people similar establishing authority possibly authenticity 
knowing done important reasons similarity purpose 
may care great deal done people goal similar mine 
related reason goal discovery process starting task realizing relates accomplished task 
knowing happened crucial explanation learning 
knowing bit interaction history done important issues naturalness
