recognition chapter considers task recognizing object finding match model image 
inputs task library object models image objects recognized outputs specify identity pose certainty objects recognized image 
task difficult factors including knowing possible objects image knowing pose object assume image possibility object partly occluded image possibility image may cluttered unknown objects artifacts imaging process limits reliability accuracy sensor measurements convention term feature chapter refer characteristic appearance form 
chapter called feature essentially thing previous chapter called shape primitive object recognized features object model specifies features 
recognize single object image methods perform sequence steps feature detection signal processing detect features image represent symbols perceptual organization identify stable groupings features indexing features select model library object models matching find best match features image selected model verification decide match suggests modeled object image recognize number objects image methods recognize single objects repeatedly objects 
object recognized image features may deleted recognition cycle performed features remain 
indexing matching steps involve choosing alternatives alternative features models matches 
entire process essentially large search stages choices 
way methods differ balance stages attempt minimize workload 
methods emphasize effective indexing minimize number alternatives considered stages methods emphasize fast matching verification indexing need selective 
feature detection includes processes image segmentation edge detection peculiar object recognition topic extensive general surveyed 
remaining steps perceptual organization verification subjects chapter sections 
perceptual organization perceptual organization process grouping image features 
purpose object recognition produce group features informative individual features better able guide selection matching models 
term perceptual organization widely applied activities ranging segmenting curves recognizing geometric figures qualifies processes forms perceptual organization generality 
knowledge specific objects general assumptions hold objects situations encountered 
segmentation may assumptions surfaces smooth objects convex example 
insofar underlying assumptions valid feature organization produced descriptive stable assumptions fail organization may spurious unreliable 
uses specific knowledge perceptual organization predominantly bottom process proceeds iteratively low level groupings high level ones 
features level selected grouped abstracted form level 
important issue area decide features group image 
decision group certain features typically measuring various aspects relative geometry comparing measurements thresholds ideally context features considered 
example line segments sufficiently close approximately parallel prominent segments lie decision may group segments producing new feature denoting pair parallel lines 
useful object recognition group span objects features derived entirely single object 
grouping methods try produce groups satisfy condition guaranteed groups 
ensuring group involves object impractical requires perfect segmentation image 
emphasis producing groups involve single object arise due accidental arrangement objects 
subsequent object recognition stages allow missing spurious groups assuming unknown possibly empty subset groups correct 
lowe explicitly addressed role perceptual organization object recognition

indexing model database library object models features image want select model match features 
indexing problem goal better simply trying model turn 
solutions generally involve table indexed individual features small groups 
table entry indicates model viewpoint produce corresponding feature group 
recognition table entries created various viewpoints model analyzing model library rendering model sample viewpoints processing representative set training images 
recognition features chosen image index table producing hypotheses objects image

poor distributions occur objects symmetrical share common features flynn 
indexing performance greatly affected uncertainty feature measurements 
uncertainty may accommodated coarsely quantizing feature dimensions replicating table entries range duplicate entries representing range possible measurements sampling range index values lookup time 
approaches reduce selectivity index replication greatly increases storage requirement 
jacobs shown indexing groups point features particular type projection table storage requirement reduced factoring table tables having half dimensions 
markedly different approach indexing developed networks neuron units compute functions called generalized radial basis functions hyper basis functions poggio edelman brunelli poggio edelman poggio 
modeled object represented network individual units represent distinct prototypical characteristic views object 
input network vector selected image feature measurements 
output represents normalized view object tested standard view graded recognition response 
library object models represented collection networks model recognition networks applied parallel object identity indicated network producing strongest response

common error models bounded error model requires matching image feature fixed range predicted location 
corresponding match quality measure just count number matching features 
gaussian error model specifies image features distributed normally independently predicted locations 
corresponding match quality measure usually considers number matching features sum squares normalized errors 
match quality measures defined bayesian probability theory wells 
factors prior probability object image prior distribution pose conditional probability model feature matched object conditional distribution matching errors described error model estimate posterior probability particular object pose set feature matches

proceeding root tree match search examines additional image feature level tree 
branches level represent different choices model features matched image feature plus choice matching 
complete interpretation image assigning subset image features corresponding model features associated tree leaves 
search readily incorporate kinds matching constraints unary constraints require matching image model features similar properties binary constraints require pairs feature matches geometrically consistent 
local constraints sufficient ensure viewpoint consistency consequently complete interpretation subsequently verified local constraints effectively prune search
