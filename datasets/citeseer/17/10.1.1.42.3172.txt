semantic distance measures set documents essentially text strings interest estimating human notion distance inverse similarity measurements documents 
presently aware commonly types models 
string distance edit distance measure considers distance amount difference strings symbols 
example levenshtein distance known early edit distance difference text strings simply number insertions deletions substitutions letters transform string 
sophisticated example likeit string distance algorithm tries build optimal weighted matching letters multigraphs groups letters 
type text string distance measure statistics words common sets documents especially part corpus large number documents 
commonly form measure word frequencies known term frequency inverse document frequency tfidf 
consider dictionary words terms corpus documents 
systems common words called words ignored computational efficiency 
stems words considered complete words 
stemming heuristic introduced porter tries return stem forms word 
walking walk walked simply walk 
document frequency word stem fds number documents having stem ns highest term frequency called tfidf scheme word weight calculated ds dmax log nd ns dj dmax log nd nd total number documents 
order find distance documents simple dot product word vectors documents calculated 
third type semantic distance measure knowledge document components structure 
case research publications example citations papers papers create citation indices gauge document relatedness
