evaluation called appraisal

modelling appraisal process main application appraisal theories cited structural analysis semantics emotion words 
structural theories specify nature appraisal process 
response criticized exaggerated cognitivism appraisal theories appraisal theorists pointed appraisal process necessarily conscious voluntary 
scherer attempt precise specification nature appraisal process 
suggest hierarchical processing system consisting levels sensory motor schematic conceptual 
sensory motor level innate hard wired feature detectors giving rise reflex reactions 
schematic level schema matching 
schema concept introduced bartlett widely cognitive science central memory structure 
conceptual level involves reasoning inference processes active reflective 
problem solving example conceptual level process 
smith suggest model appraisal process builds distinction schematic conceptual processing suggested scherer 
schematic processing fast automatic parallel inflexible concrete 
thought terms priming spreading activation 
contrast conceptual processing slow voluntary serial flexible relying semantically accessible information 
smith especially emphasize interactions schematic conceptual processing 
example conceptual processing activate create alter schematic memories 
hand sufficiently activated schema available conceptual processing 
novel feature model proposed smith called appraisal register 
monitors appraisal information generated schematic conceptual processing addition perceptual information generates emotional reaction 
appraisal register assumed model function plays important role elicitation fear 
proposals scherer smith preliminary detailed results research areas social cognition clinical psychology neuropsychology strengthen evidence multi level appraisal process 
action tendencies coping appraisal situation just step emotion process 
successful adaptation emotion effect actions individual 
frijda change action readiness essence emotion 
mentioned section emotion lead fixed action generation action tendency 
action tendencies states readiness achieve maintain kind relationship environment 
conceived plans programs achieve ends put state readiness 

avoidance example action tendency fear 
respect action control action tendencies feature control precedence 
action tendency leads action depends feasibility tests monitoring progress 
lazarus stresses especially humans action tendencies automatically lead action 
emphasizes importance coping consists cognitive behavioral efforts manage specific external internal demands conflicts exceeding resources person 
lazarus action tendency innate biological impulse coping complex deliberate psychological process draws heavily possible effective specific context compatible social personal standards conduct display rules action rules 
coping processes augment inhibit innate action tendencies

research agent architectures emotion synthesis agent architectures wooldridge jennings jennings sycara wooldridge provide thorough review existing agent architectures 
distinction deliberative reactive hybrid architectures briefly highlighted 
wooldridge jennings define deliberative agent architecture contains explicitly represented symbolic model world decisions example actions perform logical pseudo logical reasoning pattern matching symbolic manipulation

higher layers represent behaviours suppressed output lower layers 
subsumption architecture prototypical example reactive agent architecture 
despite merits reactive architectures jennings sycara wooldridge enumerate number disadvantages

result called hybrid architectures developed combine aspects deliberative reactive architectures 
typically hybrid architecture consists number layers arranged hierarchically

artificial life situated emotions survey earlier artificial intelligence research models emotion pfeifer majority efforts fundamentally hampered attempt isolate object study termed traditional research methodology 
similar criticism voiced early late aaron sloman 
pfeifer review seminal effect insofar substantially contributed setting avalanche related artificial life community 
basic tenet animat artificial life approach thoroughly explore space opportunities offered simple designs virtue situatedness physical embodiment moving incorporation complex components declarative representations related manipulation capabilities 
nowadays commonly recognized research functional process models emotion synthesis requires agent designs 
various approaches adopted adopting guidelines ethology neurophysiology cognitive social science 
briefly discuss affective reasoner representative appraisal architecture 
existing appraisal architecture affective reasoner architecture domain independent emotion reasoning 
uses descriptive process model emotion cognitive theory emotion eliciting conditions defines discrete emotion types 
rudimentary personalities engendered affective reasoner architecture comprise interpretive personality component providing individuality respect interpretation situations personality component conferring individuality respect way agents express manifest emotions 
agent interpretive personality component defined means hierarchical goals standards preferences gsp database personality component encoded action database 
processing flows initiating event simulated world emotion action generation final stages simulating observation agents 
initiating situations construed fall eliciting condition classes goal relevant events acts accountable agents attractive unattractive objects combinations categories 
way successful instantiates emotion eliciting condition relation structure eec tuple encoding characteristics situation relevant processing derived slot structure employed boris system 
affective reasoner covers finite set discrete emotions mapping eecs emotions involves ad hoc solutions cope number problems caused fact mapping unique may multiple times conflicting emotions 
instantiated emotions mapped actions means emotion manifestation lexicon 
emotion classes action response categories defined comprising somatic responses behavioural responses communicative responses evaluative responses cognitive responses initiation plans 
deployment domain example phd thesis actual response actions ranked intensity defined action response category 
lexicon comprises individual actions defined application domain 
addition conflict sets defined explicitly rule incompatible manifestations may triggered occurring emotions 
affective reasoner includes support social emotions virtue concerns database initialized partial systemwide gsp database extended case abductive reasoning runtime program
