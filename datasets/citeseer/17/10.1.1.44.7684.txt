principal intention describe csp define anonymity properties analyse anonymity protocols 
csp appropriate formal method describing analysing communications protocols designed describe systems terms components interact means message passing 
important firstly understand concept anonymity examining way generally 
formal definition provided explored refined applying known situations confirming diagnosis provided definition corresponds expected

anonymity notions analyse anonymity security property crucial define precise way 
real life activities may done anonymously examples include donating money publishing poems sending mail voting informing police posting bulletin boards 
formal definition applicable wide variety situations 
natural question arises anonymity property events messages property agents 
scenarios described suggest anonymity involved particular message event property agents associated event message 
example specific voting situation members party voted elect new leader requirement voter associated particular vote anonymous 
example informed police hide identity 
case police cases hide nature information 
hidden information contrast identity informant better considered confidential anonymous 
case confidentiality refer messages content kept secret anonymity refer messages originator recipient kept secret 
identify various aspects anonymity 
provided agents discussion agent wishes hide identity 
anonymous mail poem donation informing police wants anonymous 

viewing world particular viewpoints may anonymity respect information respect privileged information 
example regard anonymous donation organisation receiving donation may know identity donor general public 
anonymity donor respect absence particular privileged information 
furthermore anonymity respect relationship donor donation 
identity donor may known contexts fact connection donor donation hidden provides anonymity 
issue arises concerns control withholding particular privileged information required provide anonymity 
chaum concerned distinction proposed protocols agent possession information 
written number papers cha cha subject main kinds transaction identified payments credentials transactions 
chaum electronic cash scheme example author promises anonymity digital coins user bank associate payment payer consent 
argument chaum system permits fraud detection transaction tracing consent individual 
system addresses problems double spending coin 
credentials example demonstrating anonymity 
credentials usually needed prove credibility identity 
untraceable credentials pseudonyms credibility proven identity 
pseudonym organisation problem double identity addressed 
additionally uses different pseudonyms different organisations trace suitable implementation organisations convinced dealing correct individual 
saves individual trouble giving potentially sensitive information order prove identity
