eventual aim research reported develop automatic system pronunciation grading dutch speech recognition technology 
studies investigation performance speech recognizer validated pronunciation scores assigned human experts 
important characteristics investigation compared previous ones different groups human experts involved raters human raters required evaluate aspects pronunciation quality 
results obtained study reported previous papers :10.1.1.43.8086

furthermore previously reported automatic measures speech quality related temporal properties speech able predict expert pronunciation scores high degree accuracy fast speakers generally receive high pronunciation ratings :10.1.1.43.8086
results suggest pronunciation grading system suffice measure temporal variables 
convenient automatic measures calculated relatively easily temporal measures fail cases 
instance subject speak target sentence fast poor pronunciation rapidly speak sentence target sentence 
hope shelf continuous speech recognizer csr cleverly able detect problems 
shown likelihood ratios promising way try detect utterance prompted spoken 
ratios simple compute shelf csr require specific anti models trained 
investigate ratios straightforward compute contribute automatic assessment pronunciation quality independent speech rate measures 
doing intend improve understanding pronunciation quality assessment process

discussion goals viz 
investigate conventional provide measures pronunciation quality automatic assessment improve basis understanding assessment pronunciation quality 
previous research revealed temporal measures predictors op :10.1.1.43.8086
instance correlations ros op vary 
various reasons measuring temporal variables suffice automatic pronunciation assessment 
speaker speak target sentence fast poor pronunciation 
speak different sentence quickly 
need independent measures help detect problem conditions 
lrs research strongly correlated ros believe reasons assume measures signal situation speaker produces wrong sentence ros prompted utterance 
fact lrs contain additional information ros due fact speech rate pronunciation quality data closely related 
obvious correlations table 
interpretations possible point 
aspects really interrelated 
kind artefact data limited read speech 
matter fact possible underlying construct proficiency read speech reflected segmental quality fast speech rate time 
entail read speech data impossible find variable correlated segmental quality rate speech 
way separate variables search ways prompting utterances rate pronunciation quality stake 
prompting situations devised questionable ecological validity

question point lrs distinguish utterances globally correct phonemic articulated foreign accent 
general lrs best computed comparing lh model specific anti model lr lh model lh anti model 
somewhat similar situation described task judge speech relatively homogeneous group native americans speak french

instrument measure foreign speakers wide range measurement swets zeitlinger ptt telecom 
backgrounds speak dutch take recourse specific anti research dr possible fellowship models 
want limit royal netherlands academy arts sciences 
standard dutch wanted allow generally accepted regional dutch accents 
reason polyphone data base train csr data base contains varieties dutch balanced 
possible explanation results anti model may optimal anti model trained non native dutch better 
unfortunately moment data base large train anti model 
possible better anti model obtain better results reported 
basis results may legitimate wonder constitutes foreign accent 
acoustic phonetic properties speech signal responsible percept foreign accent 
unfortunately simple answer question 
case answer depend combination second language 
language pairs lead characteristic insertions deletions substitutions non native speech 
principle insertions deletions detected means asr techniques comparing forced relevant segments transcriptions 
substitutions may harder detect 
distortions segments produced recognizable way different way natives pronounce difficult pin acoustic phonetic terms 
may non native distortions tracked precise models temporal dynamics articulation 
known generation hmms bad job modeling temporal dynamics 
word utterance likelihoods obtained conventional hmm recognizer capture acoustic phonetic details responsible perception foreign accent 
hmm recognizers may deployed score number inserted deleted segments long type segments affected accurately predicted knowledge language learner specific second language 
recapitulate results far show prediction op obtained basis ros lrs prevent speakers produce wrong utterances ros get high pronunciation scores 
research needed determine refined assessment foreign accent possible 
look different directions 
instance may useful look measures take account speech dynamics far 
alternatively try improve calculation log likelihood ratios looking appropriate anti models 
case kind research profit insight foreign accent really say research needed determine constitutes foreign accent
