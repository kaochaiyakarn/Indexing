maximal time corresponding jr distinguish cases corresponding relations case denote kr prefix rn suffix prefixes suffixes defined sense 
define concatenation kr rn times greater change flow send flow arrived contradicts assumption reachable relative change flow 
second case denote rn suffix define concatenation jr rn contradiction follows case 
third case choose time time corresponds jr times greater jr appear times greater follows jr consecutive node time pairs decreasing times say focus attention consecutive pairs 
change interval ti 
case rule vi held change flow time relative second case rule vii held time relative consider suffix jr starts 
consecutive pairs cross time ends time times greater denote rn suffix define rn times greater easy verify times changed proper chain node time pairs times greater change flow increased flow relative time chain change flow node reachable relative time chosen arbitrarily conclude change node reachable relative times interval
