information retrieval ir searching graph structured databases 
traditional ir setting proximity search typically implemented near operator effective identifying documents contain multiple keywords close proximity distance defined number characters separating keywords 
structure textual nearness appropriate

elements problem stated formally abstractly follows 
consider set foe oe oe sequence labels 
construct single sequence oe labels best summarizes sequences oe contains label appearing oe exactly 
corresponds oe oe elements oe encodes subelement ordering element simple example atthe section acd constructed oe abcd 
algorithms describe proposed algorithms solving problem specified section 
note simple example section algorithms select abcd proposed best permutation 
algorithms evaluated experimentally section 
greedy option simple greedy algorithm generate oe foe oe select label appears head largest number sequences label label oe 
remove instances repeat process sequences empty 
oe contain labels exactly 
algorithm simple effectively summarize sequence order cases situations produce counterintuitive results 
consider babb babb abb abb input greedy algorithm construct 
choice poor job reflecting fact thata precedes data far precedes edit distance intricate algorithm constructed string edit distance gus measures minimum number character insertions deletions changes required transform string 
example words wall till edit distance starting wall change change note distance symmetric 
brute force approach consider candidates oe permutations labels oe compute sum edit distances candidate oe sequences oe permutation minimum edit distance selected 
example section abx axb tie best permutations algorithm 
possible ways tune approach 
example may assigned different edit functions account consecutive labels set cost label deletion cheaper exactly adjacent label 
possibility non linear combination edit distances oe sequences enhance mitigate impact particular sequence set 
unfortunately algorithm extremely expensive computationally pruning strategies essential making practical general 
weighted averages third algorithm calculate average sequence position label sequences pick final sequence matches average sequence number label 
explicitly collapse consecutive identical labels compute sequence positions 
specifically consider foe oe oe unique label oe compute pos oe average position oe collapsing consecutive identical labels 
simple example pos collapsing consecutive labels second label 
label appears position sequence number consecutive instances position final average

experimental framework performance results evaluate different algorithms large data sets created simple program generates sets label sequences varying characteristics 
language possible labels consists letters upper lower case 
program takes lottery approach picking labels construct sequence 
input integer parameter label picked times letter 
second label picked times letter letters input parameter vary 
lower case letters addressed momentarily 
time label selected lottery determine consecutive instances label include sequence 
equally consecutive instances included input parameter 
third parameter noise intended model occasional inclusion atypical labels may happen semistructured data 
selecting new label sequence chances insert randomly selected lower case letter sequence 
example set upper case labels making quite letters selected order moderate repetition noise 
results represent run generate sequences 
compare effectiveness algorithms section measure algorithm chooses correct permutation vary input parameters 
setting say permutation correct appear permutation lexicographic order 
precedes precedes 
ignore noise labels determining permutation correct 
algorithm select correct permutation increases labels chosen order increases noise added labels 
furthermore algorithm consistently select correct smaller practice finding intuitive permutations 
note running time experiments effectiveness selecting permutation 
weighted averages greedy algorithms linear running time respect total number labels sequences edit distance algorithm shows factorial space time growth number distinct labels sequences 
number different noise labels wa ed gr noise effectiveness comparison ordered dataguide algorithms quickly algorithm infeasible experiments small adjustment consider permutations primary labels measure edit distances original sequences include primary noise labels 
compare effectiveness algorithms
