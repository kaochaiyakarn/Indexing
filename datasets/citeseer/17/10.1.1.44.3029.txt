years growing need advances establishment management terminological resources 
vast quantities new electronic material simultaneously causing requirement enabling fulfilled 
particular new terms constantly emerging undergoing changes meaning 
possible carry tasks term recognition ontology creation manually automatic semi automatic approaches required 
increasing availability suitable electronic texts enabled methods widely areas terminology term recognition attention largely focused statistical methods involving little understanding 
relatively successful practical terms contribute theoretical insights 
approaches linguistic nature involve shallow knowledge tend restricted narrow field portable new domains 
tiered approach extraction multiword terms 
underlying layer corpus largely statistical whilst top layer exploits semantic information context exterior lexical resource 
enables candidate terms identified ranked order termhood disambiguation carried enabling different meanings terms ranked individually 
fundamental principles terms concepts known correct association term concept important machine translation true application computational linguistics involving specialised languages

methods automatic term recognition involving purely linguistic information fairly limited 
fall main categories extrinsic information intrinsic information relative term 
types information tend syntactic lexter syntactic morphological 
approaches atr statistical linguistic information 
generally main part algorithm statistical part shallow linguistic information incorporated form syntactic filter permits certain combinations syntactic categories considered candidate terms 
little semantic information purpose term recognition largely contrast morphological syntactic information hard identify manipulate 
extracting semantic information hand semantic information fairly extensively purposes knowledge acquisition word sense disambiguation 
specifically terminology methods tend general language dictionaries thesauri 
common method compare content dictionary definition word words surrounding context 
lesk online dictionary calculate overlap dictionary definitions word senses smeaton calculated word word similarity related words thesaurus yarowsky captured meanings word senses semantic categories roget thesaurus 
application methods word sense disambiguation largely successful 
main reasons entirely suitable 
firstly word sense term sense disambiguation 
secondly designed deal general domain specific language 
technical terms covered sufficiently general language dictionary thesaurus propose really require specialised source information 
alternative approach acquisition semantic information involves disambiguated corpus training 
riloff lehnert developed algorithm derive relevancy cues training texts information extraction 
soderland developed system identify concepts text means linguistic features reliably identified conceptual content phrase 
grefenstette adopted hybrid approach automatic extraction semantic information large corpora syntactic information 
advantage techniques require dictionary thesaurus provide information specific corpus 
require suitable large scale corpora 
term sense disambiguation ways term sense disambiguation similar problem word sense disambiguation 
differs main aspects 
firstly terms domain specific means general language resources techniques may appropriate 
secondly majority technical terms consist word average length np terms approximately words depending type corpus 
ambiguity multiword terms generally caused different senses individual components term different senses term 
different meanings term may linked different domains may equally specific domain 
domain specific text contain meanings term related domain rule possibility general meaning term 
example biochemistry term complement refer component blood serum equally medical text general meaning 
similarly term drug medical text refer illegal substance simply kind medicine 
differences techniques applied word sense disambiguation appropriate term sense disambiguation 
contextual information nc value method approach built method automatic term recognition called 
uses mixture statistical linguistic information rank candidate terms 
contextual information acquired incorporate deeper forms linguistic knowledge improving recognition performing disambiguation terms different senses term distinguished individually ranked 
frantzi approach potential terms extracted corpus ranked value method frequency occurrence term length

identifying relevant contextual information known linguistic contexts provide rich valuable source information 
problem lies identifying parts context relevant 
domain specific corpus clear parts context equally useful 
traditionally index find window words surrounding candidate terms contexts manually investigated time consuming laborious process
