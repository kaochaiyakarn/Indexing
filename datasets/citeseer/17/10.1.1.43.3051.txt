exploit fact users bring background knowledge experience understanding situation 
situatedness information seeking human information seeking domain especially interesting exploring situatedness increasingly hot topic information age

research geared investigating user interaction information spaces supported constraining determining interpretation information seeking situation 
research major assumptions 
consider information needs processes occur humans explore environment information needs viewed inherently dynamic phenomena similar knowledge 
second consider information seeking instance jean lave calls situated social practice 
follows describe approaches developed order support users interacting information spaces accounting situatedness 
approaches focus interaction global conferencing system usenet news largest distributed information systems 
past years usenet heavily information ltering experiments 
addition usenet suited illustrate certain aspects socially situated activity hard observe 
usenet speci environment characteristic constraints heavily utilized general insights useful domains 
rst approach augmented news client exploits user interaction client reducing amount information 
ltering interesting discussions discussions user look signi cant period time 
filtering involve modeling user interests purely user interaction discussions 
important note tool situated 
tool supports user exploring interests interaction discussions 
approach supports social navigation usenet newsgroups

tool extends rudimentary version social navigation providing additional social activity indicators ackerman starr 
indicators visualize hidden reading activities newsgroups 
reading frequent activity usenet newsgroups reading observed speci support 
visualizing reading activities enables user gain insights potential interests newsgroup users social dynamics newsgroup
