trademark trademark database collection graphical symbols designs 
currently trademark design database multimedia abstracted image representation knowledge base 
examples graphical symbols 
graphical symbols stored database binary image data 
shows examples graphical symbols 
patent office compare applied figures tens thousands existing registered graphical symbols 
burdensome task avoided image database system accepts query visual example 
trademark system user provide visual example key image image scanner 
system evaluates similarities graphical features visual example graphical symbols database 
system retrieves similar graphical symbols key image similarity values 
graphical feature characterize graphical symbols 
ffl spatial distribution black pixels distribution black pixels represents outline graphical symbol 
numbers black pixels binary image meshes give approximation outline 
ffl spatial frequency spatial frequency measure complexity graphical symbols 
approximate run length distribution meshes 
ffl spatial structural features local correlation contrast show spatial relationships relative position partial figures 
approximate local correlation contrast black pixels meshes 
graphical features extracted graphical symbol stored database
