tahoe style tcp source receives duplicate acks infers dropped packet begins slow start 
seconds slow start triggered fast retransmit congestion window packets source retransmits packets receiving return packet 
ack packet causes source transmit packet

fast retransmit sender congestion control window reaches sender transmits packets 
sender receives ack packet transmits packets 
sender receives ack packet retransmits packets 
sender receives dup acks packets responses packets 
point congestion window sender transmits packets 
receiver receives packets receiver sends dup acks packet 
dup acks trigger second fast retransmit sender reduces congestion window transmits packet 
receiver receives packets returns acks 
immediately second transmission packet sender receives ack transmission packet 
sender increases congestion window sends packets 
trace continues unfold fashion 
case second fast retransmit triggered dup acks packet ultimately leads succession fast retransmits 
fast retransmit roundtrip time congestion window gets larger packets packet transmitted twice 
case pathological scenario continue indefinitely 
recommendations fix problem multiple fast retransmits treat duplicate acks acknowledge packets window packets previous fast retransmit indication continued congestion 
tahoe tcp implementation simulator fix done extra variable high seq record highest sequence number outstanding tcp initiated fast retransmit responded ecn explicit congestion notification source quench message explicit congestion notification bit implemented simulator packet headers retransmit timer timeout 
duplicate acks acknowledge data higher sequence number necessarily indication congestion trigger fast retransmit 
tcp source transmitted packet higher variable high seq variable disabled set zero congestion event 
reno tcp implementation issues slightly different 
set variable high seq tcp source responds ecn retransmit timer timeout set tcp initiates fast fast recovery 
allow multiple fast retransmits fast recovery prevent sequence fast retransmit fast recovery timeout second fast retransmit fast recovery window data 
disadvantage fix tahoe reno cases acks acknowledge data greater high seq tcp source distinguish duplicate acks resulting retransmitted packets previously correctly received receiver duplicate acks resulting packet losses 
absence selective acks inevitable fix rely incomplete information occasionally result sub optimal behavior 
robust appropriate fix problem implement selective acks 
problem multiple fast retransmits described section occurs source retransmits packets correctly received receiver 
selective acks behavior generally avoided
