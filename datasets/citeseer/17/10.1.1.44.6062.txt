represent objective functions 
functions form mathematical description performance criteria usually conflict 
term optimize means finding solution give values objective functions acceptable designer 
formally state follows find vector satisfy inequality constraints equality constraints optimize vector function xn vector decision variables 
words wish determine set numbers satisfy particular set yields optimum values objective functions 
constraints define feasible region point defines feasible solution 
vector function function maps set set represents possible values objective functions 
components vector represent non criteria considered 
constraints represent restriction imposed decision variables 
vector reserved denote optimal solutions normally

min max optimum compares relative deviations separately attainable minima 
consider ith objective function relative deviation calculated jf gamma jf jf gamma jf clear assume 
objective functions going minimized equation defines function relative increments going maximized defines relative decrements 
equation works conversely 
vector relative increments defined components vector evaluated formula max fz define min max optimum follows point min max optimal recurrence formula satisfied step min max fz fi index value maximal 
set solutions ae satisfies step step min max fz fi index value step maximal 
set solutions gamma ae satisfies step gamma step min gamma max gamma fz fi gamma index value rth step maximal 
set solutions gamma ae satisfies step gamma step min gamma max gamma gamma set optimal values fractional deviations ordered non increasingly
