non repeated micro payments brokerage trusted third parties far assumed long lived relationship buyer seller justify establishment macro payment context 
reasonable assumption circumstances cases relax assumption 
underlying assumption approach broker introducing broker trusted third party ttp holds sum users broker buy form particular seller intensively constitutes virtual repeated micro payment broker seller 
furthermore assumed buyer broker relation buyer non repeatedly purchase sellers broker constitutes virtual buyer broker repeated micro payment 
entire system works follows see 
buyer establishes micro payment relation shared session key ttp 

buyer wants purchase sends micro desc gammat tp pb ttp protected pertinent session key 
naturally non reentrant micro products current exchange rate obligation give actual rate point time opposed just replaying historic rate released

evaluation approach employ brokerage avoid problems non repetitive buyer behavior provides security gains 
main achievement simplify monetary relations avoid situations buyer obtains change wants coupons 
efficiency point view advantage reduced computational complexity seller site potential bottleneck increased broker seller relationship longer lived involves transactions buyer seller relationship micro payments macro payment done 
open issues bottleneck broker broker directly involved transaction easily bottleneck 
letting buyer pre fetch coupons decouple interaction broker buyer buyer seller 
case seller expect pre images distributed ttp various buyers arrive sequence 
seller relax requirement strictly consecutive arrival order maintain list potentially arriving pre images 
owing low financial amounts stake probably permissible add explicit expiration pre images inform parties involved urgency deposit informal rules normal case 
problem exacerbated rule pre image sequence deposited multiple pre images spent transaction simply giving lowest numbered pre image
