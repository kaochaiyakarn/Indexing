logical representations meet desiderata propose representation mechanism order logic statistical information developed bacchus bac 
logic basically order logic augmented allow expression various assertions proportions 
syntactically augment ordinary collection order symbols symbols useful expressing numeric assertions 
addition allowing generation ordinary firstorder formulas allow generation numeric assertions involving proportions 
example expresses assertion individuals domain property hx yi expresses assertion pairs domain individuals stand relation general ff existent formula vector variables proportion term ff denotes proportion ary vectors domain individual satisfy formula ff 
statistical information wish express fact statements conditional probability denoting relative proportions 
example ffjfi denote proportion ary vectors domain individuals satisfy fi satisfy ff 
express various statistical assertions expressing various constraints values proportion terms take 
example asserting jp asserting domain considering 
give formal specification semantics language see bac details 
specification simply formalizes notion formula free variables true false depending variables instantiated 
example bird true tweety false clyde 
proportion term simply evaluates proportion possible instantiations formula true 
language express wide variety statistical assertions bac gives extensive collection examples express expressed order logic essential structuring mechanisms taxonomies applied 
example domain contain things collection coins collection events 
addition obvious symbols language include predicate true individual iff coin tossing event coin true iff coin object holds individuals iff event object event object coin tossing event particular coin tossed 
express 
object coin 
object coin toss coin 

fair heads object 
agree call coin fair iff approximately events tossed result heads 
example demonstrates useful interplay universal quantification proportion terms 

theta heads object fi fi coin 
formula says coins approximately events tossed result heads 
coins domain approximately fair 
example demonstrates useful ability nest proportion statements 
representing bayesian networks logic described previous section represent large knowledge base general logical statistical information collection sentences 
difficult see discrete valued bayesian network easily represented explicit inclusion events domain individuals similar inclusion objects time points situations situation calculus mh 
may philosophical objections technical difficulties avoided restrict finite collection distinct events 
logic 
give particular scheme representing arbitrary network schemes possible 
bayesian network completely specified pieces information product decomposition joint distribution specifies topological structure network matrices conditional probability values parameterize nodes network pea 
consider arbitrary network nodes set fx xng 
node set parents phi qi psi gives index node th parent qi number parents furthermore node take discrete set values fv ki ki number different values topological structure completely specified equation xn jx theta delta delta delta theta xn jx qn topological structure equivalent assertion joint distribution nodes decomposed product lower order conditionals 
equation shorthand 
full specification product decomposition holds collection values nodes take 
translate equation sentence logic creating function symbol node convenience symbol structure equation rewritten sentence delta delta delta fi fi fi delta delta delta theta 
theta fi fi fi delta delta delta qn qn treated multi valued nodes function symbols language 
translated sentence asserts particular set values take proportion events achieve set values computed lower order relative proportions 
universal quantification ensures product decomposition holds collection values 
having completely specified topological structure equally easily specify conditional probability parameters language 
node provides probability allowed values possible instantiation possible technical caveats represent networks continuous valued nodes 
restrict attention discrete valued nodes 
parents qi matrix conditional probabilities consists collection individual equations form jx delta delta delta qi qi value variable numeric probability value 
translate equations sentences logic create new constant symbols possible value node convenience symbol equation rewritten sentence fi fi fi delta delta delta qi qi simply rewritten conditional probability equations equations involving proportion events takes value procedure applied network 
observation 
discrete valued bayesian network represented collection sentences knowledge base 
important point translation translated assertions represent template networks 
pointed bgw probabilistic networks consultation systems template models 
nodes represent generalized events get instantiated particular event consideration 
example node representing disease instantiated patient john smith disease node representing blood test shows low white cell count instantiated blood test patient john smith shows low white cell count representation template nature networks explicit formulas refer proportions classes similar events particular events 
see limitation representational power simply accurate representation allows greater modularity 
propositional networks referring particular events generated knowledge base model construction techniques 
simple model construction introduce basic ideas underlie model construction technique consider knowledge base consists simply collection template bayesian networks applicable different types events 
specify different decomposition collection conditional probability parameters applicable different class events need add event type extra conditioning formula 
example say networks suitable diagnosing abdominal pain 
networks designed women late term pregnancy pregnancy pregnancy theta jx pregnancy theta jx pregnancy pregnancy pregnancy theta jy pregnancy theta jy pregnancy alternate structures abdominal pain suitable patients abdominal pain 
general knowledge base contain formulas equations shown 
example events involving abdominal pain pregnancy different network models structural decompositions entirely different variables events pregnancy 
similar manner represent collection disjoint types events event type modeled different probabilistic structure 
case model construction technique case simply locate appropriate template model information particular event reasoned 
example event know pregnancy event reasoned involves pain pregnant patient construct network model reasoning second template model 
network structure theta jy theta jy parameterized values specified knowledge base variables 
constructed network specific event drop extra condition know satisfies conditions 
event specific network reason probable values variables particular event 
see model constructor simply instantiating general template model particular event 
structure probability parameters class abdominal events assigning probabilities particular event identical statistics general class events 
example direct inference statistics class similar events assign probabilities particular event 
example assign probability event heads particular coin toss statistics series coin tosses performing direct inference 
kind inference pervasive reasoning uncertainty

easily accomplish thing control structure chooses collection networks 
main difference explicit declarative representation network applicable type event 
furthermore serves illustrate basic idea approach 
general model construction general explicit template models knowledge base events wish reason 
exactly point approach want deal situations ability template models 
knowledge base contain information conditional probabilities isolated neighborhoods related variables 
example having explicit product decomposition relevant variables examples knowledge base simply contain individual product terms neighborhood information isolation

holmes pieces statistical information statistics event house police car parked outside pieces information specific particular event reasoned 
task model construction procedure information specific particular event reasoned decide local pieces statistical information relevant linked bayesian network representation 
network constructed quickly perform range complex reasoning particular event 
issues arise constructing bayesian network model particular event reasoning 
model construction procedure information variables properties event question wish include constructed network 
second information particular event locate appropriate pieces local statistical information knowledge base 
third combine local pieces information network 
set variables information supplied collection variables want model constructed network 
simplest case just supply query particular event consideration additional information event 
example reasoning event query expressed burglary burglary occur part event 
information watson dr watson reported alarm holmes house event 
knowledge base similar procedure determine chain probabilistic influence report watson belief alarm sounding belief burglary inference query 
chain influence find knowledge base linking alarm reports constructed network contain burglary node alarm sound node alarm report node 
strictly query driven procedure constructed model contain variables relevant particular query 
alternately supply procedure information 
example specify set variables wish include constructed model 
example specify interested reasoning earthquakes radio broadcasts 
knowledge base local statistics frequency alarms sounding earthquakes radio reports earthquakes larger bayesian network constructed includes nodes variables 
links variables determined local statistics contained knowledge base 
example know frequency alarm triggers earthquake events place link earthquake node alarm node constructed network 
simple query driven case procedure able add additional intermediate variables link variables set interest 
intermediate variables looking knowledge base chains influences specified variables 
example inform procedure build model set diseases fd dn set symptoms fs sm search chains local conditional probabilities linking members sets 
constructed network generally contain additional intermediary nodes describing causal processes known link diseases various symptoms just alarm sound information linked alarm reports query driven case 
want amortize effort constructing bayesian network range queries 
probably want supply model constructor information just single query 
locating appropriate local statistics information particular event help determine collection local statistics appropriate

linking local pieces appropriate local statistics obtained database information link various nodes network 
local statistic serve parameterize link nodes network 
difficulty arises justifying composition 
really know probability distribution describing interaction variables local conditional probabilities 
general different joint probability distributions consistent local conditional probabilities 
linking nodes manner determined solely local information constructing particular joint distribution local conditional probabilities determine product decomposition 
important question extent procedure justified
