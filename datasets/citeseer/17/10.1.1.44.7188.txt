interactions developing system interactions subsystems posed particular challenges 
general problems arose conflicts data files 
keeping layered approach software engineering general system maximally modular data driven 
modules utilize types information inconsistencies caused conflicts areas

software robust accurate satisfy paying customers 
second proposed change new feature improvement step backward 
customers concerned precision see matches explain 
precision eliminated majority customer complaints accuracy 
oddly quite willing bad system behavior explaining away implausible matches convinced system basic accuracy 
customers rarely test recall rare know pictures available enter successive related queries compare match sets 
complaints recall initial stages system development came suppliers wanted ensure pictures retrieved reliably 
test recall precision controlled environment early phase development test set images created manually matched photo researcher queries submitted photo researchers 
process time consuming imprecise difficult score matches partial hard determine credit assign say match match human researcher 
precision tests live image pni system easier evaluate system images requested 
example database containing little girls red shirts offer girls kind shirt red comprehensive database bury imperfect matches beneath highly ranked accurate matches 
ultimately precision tested queries full system bad match partial match ranked complete match counted top images rated

manual sense tagging improve precision 
preliminary experiments performed wordnet senses manually tagged completely untagged 
corpora strictly comparable photos different correct answers different case 
corpus includes pictures data provide interesting comparisons preliminary stage 
certain measures taken ensure test useful possible constraints described 
results consistent shown voorhees 
precision measured principal effect tagging precision untagged irrelevant captions show results lack tagging cause correct matches missed 
crossing matches scored bad 
match incorrect match correct score precision 
hand match incorrect matches incorrect precision penalty want expect partial matches follow matches 
top matches scored 
reasons scoring hundreds thousands matches impractical 
second actual usage care match better match top matter 
third threshold set matches definition half right 
raising threshold increase perceived precision provide insight system performance
