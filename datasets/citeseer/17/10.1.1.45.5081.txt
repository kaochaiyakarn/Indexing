evaluation individual language processing components forming part larger scale natural language processing nlp application systems emerged important area research see rubio gaizauskas 
syntactic parser component nlp system reliable technique comparing assessing relative strengths weaknesses different parsers different versions parser development necessity 
current methods evaluating accuracy syntactic parsers measuring degree parser output replicates analyses assigned sentences manually annotated test corpus 
exact match parser output corpus typically required order allow different parsers utilising different grammatical frameworks compared 
methods fully objective standards met criteria testing met set advance 
evaluation technique currently widely proposed grammar evaluation interest group harrison see grishman macleod sterling known parseval 
method compares phrase structure bracketings produced parser bracketings annotated corpus treebank computes number bracketing matches respect number bracketings returned parser expressed precision respect number corpus expressed recall mean number crossing brackets sentence bracketed sequence parser overlaps treebank properly contained 
advantages parseval relatively bracketed treebank annotation required level cross framework system comparison achieved measure moderately fine grained robust annotation errors 
number disadvantages parseval documented 
particular carpenter manning observe sentences penn treebank ptb marcus santorini marcinkiewicz contain relatively brackets analyses quite flat 
goes treebank english general susanne sampson 
crossing bracket scores small bad parser carpenter manning point adjunction structure ptb gives post noun head modifiers np np man pp np telescope zero crossings cases vp attachment incorrectly returned vice versa 
conversely lin demonstrates crossing brackets measure cases penalise mis attachments lin argues high score phrase boundary correctness guarantee reasonable semantic reading produced 
subsequent evaluations parseval collins adapted incorporate constituent labelling information just bracketing 
conversely phrase boundary disagreements stem systematic differences parsers grammars corpus annotation schemes justified context theories 
parseval attempt circumvent problem removal consideration bracketing information constructions agreement analysis schemes practice low negation auxiliaries punctuation traces unary branching structures 
general major problems compatibility annotations treebanks analyses returned parsing systems manually developed generative grammars opposed grammars acquired directly treebanks 
treebanks constructed sets informal guidelines indicating type structures assigned 
absence formal grammar controlling verifying manual annotations number different structural configurations tends grow check 
example ptb implicitly contains distinct context free productions majority occurring charniak 
difficult accurately map structures assigned independently developed grammar parser structures appear appear treebank 
problem parseval bracket precision measure penalises parsers return structure treebank annotation correct srinivas doran 
able treebank report meaningful parseval precision scores parsers necessarily dumb output attempt map exactly distinctions treebank mapping difficult specify accurately 
parseval evaluation objective results reliable 
addition parseval measuring similarity phrase structure trees applied grammars produce dependency style analyses lexical parsing frameworks finite state constraint parsers assign syntactic functional labels words producing hierarchical structure 
overcome parseval grammar treebank mismatch problems outlined lin proposes evaluation dependency structure phrase structure analyses parser treebank automatically con gaizauskas hepple propose alternative parseval precision measure address specific shortcoming 
sets dependency relationships 
relationship consists modifier optionally label gives type relationship 
atwell argues transforming standard analyses dependency representation lose certain kinds grammatical information important subsequent processing logical information location traces moved constituents 
srinivas doran hockey joshi describe related technique applied partial incomplete parses hierarchical phrasal constituents flattened chunks relationships indicated dependency links
