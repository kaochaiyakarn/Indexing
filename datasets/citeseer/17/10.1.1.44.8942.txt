research field led development interfaces software agents require access computer workstation 
clear demand information systems demanding schedules prohibit people continuous computer access 
example motivates need personalized information delivery outside world wide web 
users spend large portion day driving 
listen radio cars access medium focuses information specific interests 
user primarily interested business news order follow current stock market listen unrelated information
