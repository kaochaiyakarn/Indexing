problem usually investigated kartha lifschitz framework action domains described part state constraints 
informally state constraint formula says proposition true possible state world 
main objective argue adequate theory ramifications requires representation information kind conveyed state constraints 
particular required representation causal relations generally determination relations hold states affairs 
turns information needed adequate theory derived action preconditions qualifications

described implied performance action 
approach substitute word caused word implied 
determining ramifications actions say infer change occur action performed necessary infer action causes change occur 
see stronger requirement possible avoid unintended ramifications infer derived qualifications 
need argued ginsberg smith lin reiter roughly speaking theory qualifications action performed performance action implies change cause 
main points illustrated example 
imagine fred turkey walk 
consider action making fred dead 
intuitively indirect effect performing action fred longer walking 
reason fred dead causes walking 
consider action making fred walk suppose fred dead
