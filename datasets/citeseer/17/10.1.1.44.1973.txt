interface learning multi topic user profiles implicit feedback marko marko cs stanford edu department computer science stanford university text recommender system recommends sets documents individual users basis user models incrementally constructed feedback previous recommendations 
users reluctant take time provide feedback explicitly 
contributions research interface design recommender system infers document preferences monitoring users actions 
second problem recommender systems determining composition set recommendations especially users interests 
interface provides mechanism users define multiple topics interest control proportions 
observations initial usability tests encouraging demonstrate system successfully learning multi topic user profiles implicit feedback users clicking drop actions 
short summarize creating interaction design text recommender system 
design intended achieve specific goals learning user models requiring explicit feedback text recommender system mean software system recommends sets documents readers creating called personalized newspapers feedback concerning previously recommended documents 
take form explicit feedback readers indicate instance degree satisfaction particular documents kind scale 
implicit feedback inferences observations readers actions instance software browse read recommended documents 
typical scenarios users supply explicit feedback morita point morita unreasonable impose extra load users trying mitigate information overload 
goal learn recommend appropriate documents implicit feedback 
affording users control composition recommendation sets user text recommender system particularly enjoyed today article new bordeaux vintage 
tomorrow personalized newspaper completely concentrated bordeaux wines 
place article new strain flu computer knows reader interests regarding health related stories 
questions concern composition recommendation set collection documents delivered single iteration single edition personalized newspaper 
information retrieval ir engine capable indexing documents quickly identifying relevant query applied tasks 
commonly studied ir machine learning communities ad hoc retrieval routing filtering classification clustering consider relevance isolated documents user topic 
seen questions posed previous paragraph text recommender system addition consider set measures appropriateness individual document depend previous recommendations 
second goal interaction design described allow users greater degree control composition recommendation sets 
interaction design text recommendation text recommender system interacts user loop 
information sources corpora pick set documents user user model initially empty 
obtain feedback user explicit implicit 
update user model accordingly 
original purpose relevance feedback individual documents improve queries retrieval systems rocchio 
subsequent adoption information filtering recommender systems resulted notions indicating document relevant topic user profile indicating similar documents recommended iteration 
clearly coincide enjoy article bordeaux wines desiring day newspaper solely concerned wine 
recommender system deliver small sets recommendations separating crucial retrieval system focussed specific query distinction safely ignored 
tradeoffs affecting recommendation set composition notion relevance relative formalized information need topical relevance fundamental ir systems 
adhere probability ranking principle robertson stipulates list documents ranked order estimated probability topical relevance query optimal output 
evaluating document independently manner leads simplest document selection strategy picking topically relevant documents 
recommender system justifiable strategies 
instance novelty important factor affecting human judgments documents wang soergel loosely defined existence information document new user 
tradeoff topical relevance novelty topically relevant documents information need similar 
marginal relevance parameter proposed control tradeoff 
known exploration exploitation tradeoff occurs setting choose documents similar user expressed preference exploitation user model reliably predict user reaction exploration 
topical relevance gives exploitation strategy norm ir systems 
exploration strategy counters resulting problem specialization commonly observed information filtering systems sheth maes 
strategies rely purely content document 
contrast collaborative strategies consider users judgments selecting documents user rated highly similar users 
research users accessed system singly collaborative methods discussed 
final tradeoff mentioned different interests user 
reason suppose consistency interests mix broad narrow ongoing transient fixed changing 
imagine attempting determine optimal points various tradeoffs ahead time dynamically adaptive mechanisms 
claim appropriate approach build interfaces allowing users control tradeoffs desires context 
slider interface basis slider user interface explicit representation multiple topics interest user resulting observations ffl separate topics reflected interface feasible users directly adjust relative proportions 
provides fine grained control composition recommendation set 
ffl interface allows users group recommended items topics choosing grouping implicit feedback requiring effort behalf users rating ranking articles 
ffl interface allows users easily create delete topics transient short term information needs served parallel ongoing long term information needs
