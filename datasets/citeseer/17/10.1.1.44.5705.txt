main similarity measures binary operators applied objects type ff return number usually real denoting degree similarity :10.1.1.57.5041
type usually ff ff data type ff :10.1.1.57.5041
described similarity metrics generalisation similarity measures :10.1.1.57.5041
similarity metric binary operator applied objects type ff returns value indicating degree objects similar 
similarity metric ff ff data type ff suitable require impose relative degree similarity say objects similar objects require partial order 
course function type reasonable similarity metric 
similarity metric function satisfy number similarity metric axioms 
axioms discussed :10.1.1.57.5041
examples similarity metrics assume estate agent computer representations houses sale 
assume project representations value certain attributes houses 
number bedrooms example value type price price type amenities locale value type pfp tg powerset fp tg subset fp tg indicates house parking space nearby shops transport connections 
occasion want boolean valued similarity measure simply says values similar 
formulate similarity metrics construct suitable partial order bool result type function partial order false true similarity metrics type ff ff bool 
example bool valued similarity metric abs gamma earlier required complete lattice see restrictive requirement :10.1.1.57.5041
thought natural restriction 
lift restriction show similarity metrics result type partial order lattice 
course false false true true 
note transitive 
bedroom bedroom house similar absolute difference number bedrooms bedroom bedroom house similar bedroom bedroom house similar absolute difference number bedrooms 
bool valued similarity metrics fail capture intuitive notion different degrees similarity 
motivates numeric valued similarity functions 
special cases framework 
numeric set ordered gives partial order need result type 
simple numeric metric measure distance values 
example price price gamma abs gamma function house prices irp house irp house similar degree gamma negated absolute difference higher degree similarity similarity irp irp house similar degree gamma 
example numeric valued similarity metric amenities cardinality intersection sets amenities pfp tg pfp tg designates house parking nearby schools fp sg similar degree house nearby schools transport fs tg 
conventional valued similarity metrics defined

final example show set valued metrics possible 
intersection time intersections denote degrees similarity pfp tg pfp tg pfp tg similarity house amenities fp sg amenities fs tg fsg 
houses amenities fp tg fs tg houses similar degree fs tg 
compare degrees similarity see second pair houses similar pair houses fsg ae fs tg 
advantages framework explained :10.1.1.57.5041
state briefly 
advantage framework subsumes ways measuring similarity boolean valued numeric valued set valued feature structure valued valued :10.1.1.57.5041
subsuming approaches know results obtain framework theorems implementation techniques apply quite broadly 
second advantage naturalness similarity measures define result types chosen best suit application 
third advantage ease combine similarity metrics 
discuss issue fully remaining sections main result new way combining similarity metrics 
combining metrics usually want compute similarities objects single projected attribute objects 
usually consider attribute price local amenities 
similarity measure attribute want compute degree similarity combining results individual similarity measures 
apparent advantage traditional numeric valued similarity measures results applying individual similarity measures easily combined possibly weighted sums products averages 
similarity metric framework course just easy combine numeric valued similarity metrics 
result types individual metrics numeric boolean set valued computing degree similarity straightforward 
address possibility individual metrics different result types 
example wish combine results price numeric valued set valued 
point convert numeric valued function simply order allow combination price necessary just numeric valued losing advantages framework 
inter conversions kind main solution literature 
inter conversion necessary 
key insight framework allows metrics partially ordered set result type 
reason result type partially ordered set pairs 
combining numeric valued price set valued degrees similarity denoted pairs theta pfp tg 
example irp house near shops transport similar irp house parking near shops degree gamma pair comprising values individual similarity metrics denotes degree similarity 
irp house local amenities irp house near shops similar degree gamma fgi 
approach advantages giving structure explanatory power degrees similarity working possible cases needing 
course simply say set pairs result type combined metric 
result type partially ordered tell gamma higher degree similarity gamma fgi 
normal route defining ordering set pairs construct orderings result types individual metrics 
need operators construct new partial orders existing partial orders 
combining partial orders va vb arbitrary partial orders 
product define product theta follows theta fhx yi sa sb va thetab hx va thetab hy va vb individual functions contribute equally degree similarity 
example houses similar degree gamma similar houses similar degree gamma fs gamma gamma fsg ae fs tg houses similar degree gamma fp similar houses similar degree gamma fs similar attribute gamma gamma similar fp tg oe fs tg 
strict prioritisation define strict prioritisation ae follows ae fhx yi sa sb hx hy vb individual function counts degree similarity second 
lexicographic ordering ordering ordering second ordering may resolve ties ordering 
example houses similar degree gamma similar houses similar degree gamma fgi gamma gamma second element pair irrelevant 
houses similar degree gamma similar houses similar degree gamma fs tie element pair tie resolved second element fsg ae fs tg 
indifference different degrees similarity product strict prioritisation represent extremes way combine partial orders partial orders count equally takes precedence 
available extremes undesirable 
traditional numeric valued similarity measures offer possibility weighted combinations choosing different amounts weighted highly influence extent similarity measure contributes highly measure 
adopt weights resort conversion metrics ones numeric result types regard undesirable 
solution turns introduce idea level indifference result type metric 
prioritisation second metric take effect metric reports equal degrees similarity reports degrees similarity indifferent 
details new prioritisation definition section 
say mean indifference degrees similarity 
consider similarity metric price 
price metric nominally important criterion prospective buyer regard small differences degrees similarity houses metric decisive choice match best criteria apply 
example probably unwise regard irp house irp house similar degree gamma decisively similar irp house irp house similar strictly lower degree gamma 
definition strict prioritisation price metric criteria small differences decisive 
better case small differences small differences house price metric differences large say similarity criteria contribute ranking 
order change signatures similarity metrics 
augment result type boolean valued binary function indicate indifferent degrees similarity ff ff need formalise notion indifference degrees similarity 
relations formalise notion generally equivalence relations 
equivalence relation effect simply discriminating result type similarity metric cases small differences similarity metric having decisive effects 
example suppose wished declare price metric similarities equivalent price price price gamma abs gamma price div div price equivalence relation 
essence simply indifference relation prior integer division price case integer division argument types price gamma abs div gamma div approach suffers weakness explain 
price gamma abs gamma div problem equivalent formulations points small differences degrees similarity decisive 
example similarity degrees gamma gamma mapped distinct values gamma similarity degrees gamma gamma mapped gamma 
reasonable ffl equality similar comparing floating point numbers indifferent degrees similarity iff abs gamma ffl 
price metric ffl gamma 
indifferent similarity degrees gamma gamma gamma gamma gamma gamma 
note relation reflexive symmetric transitive 
satisfies generally weaker property convexity 
define relation convex partial order iff generalise require indifference relation degrees similarity satisfy reflexivity symmetry convexity 
need satisfy transitivity 
generalised prioritisation argued earlier operator desired extent favours argument necessarily extent strictly lexicographical preference 
idea flexible scheme prioritisation indifference relation essentially degrees similarity pairs values wish order degrees similarity value pair indifferent values case wish take components pair account 
definition generalised prioritisation hx hy vb suppose definition prioritise price metric amenities metric ffl equality ffl indifference relation 
irp house irp house higher degree similarity exists irp house irp house irrespective amenities offer price metric takes precedence decisive 
irp house irp house strictly similar irp house irp house indifferent degrees similarity 
pair houses similar second pair require pair similar amenities
