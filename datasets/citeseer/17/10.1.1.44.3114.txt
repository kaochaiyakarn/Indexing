filtering task agent involves judging article relevant irrelevant user user profile environment prior probability encountering relevant document low compared probability encountering irrelevant document 
environment frustrating time consuming user interact agent starts knowledge obtain set positive negative examples user feedback 
user browses want evaluate web pages contain potentially interesting information 
reduce user evaluation burden webmate collects examples interesting user positive training examples 
kind interaction presents potential problems documents user label fall distinct domains fishing computer science soccer 
subclasses correspond different interests user 
methods address problem multiple user interests 
keep single user profile keywords come different domains averaged 
method disadvantage averaging vectors different documents decrease weights words important interest categories 
second method ask user explicitly provide labels sub categories interest 
webmate ask user label category interesting document learns categories automatically 
contrast systems learn user profile statically determine relevant documents webmate learns user profile incrementally continuously 
new positive example known system updates profile 
order save storage space system doesn keep previous positive example documents 
keeps profile learned positive examples 
way system adapt user evolving interests 
webmate utilizes tf idf method multiple vectors representation 
basic idea algorithm represent document vector vector space documents similar content similar vectors 
dimension vector space represents word weight 
values vector elements document calculated combination statistics term frequency tf number times word occurs document document frequency df number documents word occurs 
document frequency inverse document frequency idf calculated 
idf log jdj df jdj total number documents 
value element vector calculated product tf theta idf developed algorithm multi tf idf vector learning 
algorithm follows 
assume user domains interest 
assume initial profile set jv predefined number tf idf vectors profile set preset number elements vector positive example html documents user marked current implementation heuristically set 
preprocess parse html page deleting words non informative words stemming plural noun single form verb original form extracting words title title head head head 
weights 
extract tf idf vector document 
jv jv number vectors profile set 
calculate cosine similarity tf idf vectors including vectors profile set new document vector assume profile set fv 
sim ffl jv theta jv ig 
combine vectors vm greatest similarity 
vm arg max sim ig 
sort weights new vector decreasing order keep highest elements 
algorithm run user marks document 
user profile incrementally unobtrusively continuously updated 
compiling personal newspaper utilize approach learning user profile compile personal newspaper 
ways 
way automatically list urls user wants monitored 
example url consists news headlines home page webmate parses html page extracts links headline fetches pages constructs tf idf vector pages additional heuristics words title headings additional weights calculates similarity current profile 
similarity greater threshold recommends page user sorts recommended pages decreasing order similarity form personal newspaper 
operations www com performed middle night network traffic low 
morning user read recommended personal newspaper 
user provide urls information sources webmate constructs query top words current profile sends popular search engines altavista yahoo 
result needed immediately results returned search engines directly recommended web pages 
system fetches pages corresponding url results 
calculates similarity profile web pages recommends pages similarity greater threshold presenting results descending order relevance 
experiments experiments system monitors news sites contain articles high technology including lan time news media central pc magazine online recorded personal newspaper evaluated piece news interesting table

search refinement keywords expansion relevance feedback trigger pairs model extract relevant words single keywords usually ambiguous general 
occur vast quantities documents making search return hundreds hits irrelevant intended user query 
giving additional keywords refine search providing considerable improvement retrieval results 
refinement words meanings help disambiguate specific original search word
