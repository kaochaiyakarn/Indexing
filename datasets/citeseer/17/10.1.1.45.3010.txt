linear formula clause variable matrix linear ax concept generalizes earlier version van provides decomposition formula case clause variable matrix non zero 
called monotone variable known example linear variable appears positive negative formula vector gammae th unit vector linear 
general linear leads partial assignment formula involved rounding 
see partial assignment sign sign gamma undefined substitute defined sign formula 
clause affected substitution variable defined sign occurs clause clause obviously satisfied partial assignment ij ij ij defined sign negative 
means linear leads non trivial decomposition formula involved 
part satisfied sign part contains variables undefined sign 
clearly part satisfiability equivalent original formula satisfiable original formula shows things linear programming guarantees polynomial time search linear 
ii repeatedly applying decomposition formula satisfiable equivalent linear free subformula 
subformula unique computable polynomial time 
iii renamable horn formula unit clauses completely solved ii resulting subformula empty 
iv satisfiable sat formula completely solved ii notice case satisfying assignment fact linear 
words resulting linear free subformula non empty formula unsatisfiable 
formula said class procedure described ii results complete assignment satisfiable case linear free sat subformula unsatisfiable case 
assumed cnf formulas unit clauses 
main lemma corollaries lemma suppose cnf formula complexity index linear 
clause length clauses length 
proof true clearly gamma ze 
definition complexity index ax gamma ze gamma linear exist yields turn ze 
proves lemma 
corollary horn formula unit clauses class 
proof horn formula complexity index 
unique linear free subformula formula complexity index 
unit clauses case lemma clearly applies 
consequently see subformula empty case original formula solved completely satisfiable subformula fact unsatisfiable sat formula 
corollary properly includes horn 
proof formula clause variable matrix gamma gamma gamma linear gamma solves formula hand 
clearly horn gamma gammax gamma gamma gamma contradictory 
franco gives example example formula horn slur 
formula clause variable matrix gamma gamma gamma gamma gamma gamma show slur properly contains extended horn 
example shows slur incomparable bx implies 
corollaries easily follow main lemma 
corollary sat formula linear complexity index proof clauses length complexity index clearly satisfies gamma delta lemma follows corollary length shortest clause cnf formula 
formula satisfiable 
proof consider unique linear free subformula 
decreases increases considering subformulas assumptions hold subformula
