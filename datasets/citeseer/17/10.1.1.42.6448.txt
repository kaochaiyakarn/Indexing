view maintenance problem intensively studied database research community

focus problems raised maintenance set materialized called concrete views derived set base relations current state base relations modified 
main results concern self maintainability results concerning self maintainability generalized set views set view self maintainable respect changes underlying base relations changes may propagated views querying base relations information stored concrete views plus instance changes sufficient maintain views 
coherent efficient update propagation various algorithms provided schedule updates propagation individual view care interdependencies views may lead possible inconsistencies 
purpose auxiliary views introduced facilitate update propagation enforce self maintainability 
results self maintainability set views great interest data warehouse context commonly admitted set views stored data warehouse globally 
rationale recommendation self maintainability strong requirement imposed operational sources order overload regular activity 
stated previous section research data warehouse refreshment mainly focused update propagation materialized views 
papers published topic devoted refreshment process defined 
consider view maintenance just step complete refreshment process 
steps concern data cleaning data reconciliation data customisation needed data archiving 
hand extraction cleaning strategies may vary source update propagation may vary user view depending example desired freshness data

generic workflow refreshment process temporal external event propagation event temporal external event integration event temporal external event cleaning event temporal external event bouzeghoub fabret coordination activities workflow systems activities coordinated control flows may notification process commitment emails issued agents temporal events trigger events 
refreshment process coordination done wide range event types 
distinguish event types may trigger synchronize refreshment activities 
temporal events termination events dashed lines user defined event 
depending refreshment scenario choose appropriate set event types allows achieve correct level synchronization 
activities refreshment workflow executed soon triggered may depend current state input data stores 
example extraction triggered periodically executed effective changes source log file 
cleaning process triggered immediately extraction process executed extraction process gathered source changes 
consequently consider state input data store activity may considered condition effectively execute activity 
workflow represents refreshment process activities may different origins different semantics refreshment strategy logically considered independent activities 
operational level activities merged extraction cleaning decomposed integration 
flexibility claimed workflow systems allow dynamically tailor refreshment activities coordinating events 
may way represent workflow triggering strategies 
considering external events temporal events termination events different activities consider data changes events 
input data store refreshment workflow considered event queue triggers corresponding activity 
able represent different refreshment strategies approach needs parametric synchronization mechanism allows trigger activities right moment 
done introducing composite events combine example data change events temporal events 
alternative put locks data stores remove activity set activities decide commit

refreshment scheduling refreshment process viewed different perspectives client driven refreshment describes part process triggered demand users 
part mainly concern update customization update propagation data integration data extraction second example refreshment scenario data extraction propagation ods aggregated views
