discussion tok related developing tok forced consider issues may general interest requirements emotion may place reactive architectures goals discussion tok related building world models producing coherent behavior independent particular behaviors modeling personality influence behavior 
emotion explicit goals world models researchers argued years representing goals explicitly agents presents serious obstacles production robust reactive behavior 
course disagree view feel goals necessary organize action instance see papers varied soar 
essential oz agents reactive sympathetic reactivity arguments brooks agre 
necessary agents appear clearly goals exhibit emotion response events affecting goals 
requirement particular unsolvable explicitly representing goals agent 
accepted importance reactivity grounding sensory inputs forced facing task squarely difficult develop architecture represented goals explicitly retaining reactivity 
forced adopt view operators pre post condition pairs goals predicates world states

view goals allows avoid unpleasant consequences trying model world preserving strengths goals mechanism organizing action 
note may possible combine views plan compile architectures soar particularly rich example 
mixing independent behaviors word behavior cluster related goals plans produces recognizable internally coherent pattern action 
behavior represented single high level goal 
initially developed notion behavior allow specify lyotard 
needed concise way represent major components lyotard action attaching suggestive names set high level goals helpful 
goals implemented independently resulting set independent behaviors 
behaviors composed set hap plans subgoals appropriate context conditions success tests 
context conditions success tests developed behavior robust face changes world unexpected failures serendipitous success 
expected surprises due external events performed agents unforeseen complexities physical nature world 
turned agent actions performed interleaved behaviors main causes unexpected changes 
context conditions success tests allow independent behaviors mix fairly explicit design effort consider interactions 
adding reactivity goaldirected behavior help support production coherent robust behavior independently executing particular behaviors 
modeling personality tok support construction variety agents artists building oz worlds 
key facet support allowing different personalities modeled requiring agent built scratch 
behavioral feature mechanism appears provide simple means help achieve 
build behaviors respond standardized set behavioral features ways consistent names features 
example aggressive feature uniformly produce aggressive behavior 
feature behavior mapping fixed facets personality determined mapping emotion features 
standard fear emotion instance lead number features fright flight frozen depending artist choice emotion feature mapping 
features cause previously constructed behaviors react appropriately 
example agent goal failures seen learning experiences enable proud feature 
approach takes advantage feature mechanism role interface emotion action 
components internal hap may help model personality 
agent overestimated likelihood goal success failure optimist pessimist 
consistently importance goals tend extremes hope fear happiness sadness 
making agent success tests easily satisfied produce incompetence making context conditions difficult maintain produce kind

mechanisms including behavioral features success tests acknowledgments context conditions support integration 
lyotard particular agent built tok exhibits signs success integration 
tok maintains various kinds memory including perceptual memory richer learning mechanism absent architecture 
reasons 
oz worlds exist hours short time interesting learning occur 
integration issues discussed important application 
second integration learning action widely studied want build substantial effort compete 
result may failing see essential constraints guide better architecture 
help judge possibility colleagues implementing lyotard soar architecture 
engaged efforts extend tok 
natural language components attached tok independent lisp modules hap rules

increasingly observed similarities mechanisms hap exploring possibilities merging fully 
second oz physical world simulation conceptually straight forward embed possibly imprecise copy inside tok envisionment engine 
allow tok instance consider possible re orderings steps behaviors decisions foresight
