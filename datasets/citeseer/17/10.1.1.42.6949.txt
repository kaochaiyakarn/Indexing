algorithms experiment briefly summarized 
noun phrase extraction az noun phraser noun phrase extractor developed collaboration ai artificial intelligence group department management information systems university arizona experiment 
phraser brill tagger noun phrase identification rules 
program chosen generic trained lexicon derived different sources including wall street journal brown corpora lexicon fairly general coverage english language 
applied domains domain customization maintaining comparable parsing quality 
phraser operates distinct phases tokenization part speech tagging noun phrase identification 
tokenization text tokenized order parsed correctly noun phrase parser 
goal tokenization determine sentence boundaries separate text individual tokens removing irrelevant punctuation 
tokens strings characters separated whitespace 
punctuation characters treated specially tokenization process 
characters typically signal noun phrase boundaries considered separate tokens 
output tokenization phase list tokens analyzed tagger 
part speech tagging part speech tagger internally divided phases operation lexical analysis contextual analysis 
phase involves looking token trained lexicon commonly english words 
word entry lexicon marked possible parts speech 
token word lexicon part speech token assigned 
token appear lexicon tagger marks unknown noun 
lexical rules tagger choose closest matching part speech unknown tokens 
point process exact part speech token question 
resolve brill tagger uses number contextual rules disambiguate term part speech 
token rules examine tokens immediately preceding current token 
information tagger able determine best part speech token eventually create list tagged tokens 
noun phrase identification noun phrases recognized set patterns rules composed different orderings parts speech 
experiment limit longest noun phrase pattern recognizable words length 
shortest pattern noun phrase length just noun 
identification noun phrases realized moving sliding window tagged token list 
window starts head list size tokens size longest noun phrase recognizable 
content window parts speech tokens matches noun phrase rules noun phrase identified 
content match rules token window truncated remaining content compared noun phrase rules 
process repeated window content matches rule single word 
window move start token noun phrase just identified size reset 
tokens characters tokens tagged verb treated noun phrase delimiters 
truncate window encountered 
number limitations noun phraser current implementation 
scientific literature noun phrases greater words length appear com mon general text 
results tagger long noun phrases separate shorter phrases 
additionally tagger effectively differentiate context sensitive noun phrases meaning context general forms useful degree context free meaning 
type noun phrase identification computationally expensive compared ad hoc techniques rely solely tokenization concatenation adjacent tokens identify phrases 
az noun phraser customized particular domain training brill tagger editing words list incorporating domain specialized lexicon specialist lexicon unified medical language system umls nlm 
study conducted collaborators specialist lexicon enhanced noun phraser performed slightly better generic version collection abstracts difference statistically significant 
generic nature ease customization enable parser fulfill range noun phrase parsing needs 
occurrence analysis noun phrase extraction process keep track noun phrase frequency information compute weights noun phrase documents 
weight noun phrase document ij computed product noun phrase frequency inverse document frequency common technique adopted vector space models ir 
noun phrase frequency tf ij represents number occurrences noun phrase document document frequency df represents number documents collection noun phrase occurs 
represented equation 
ij tf ij log df represents total number documents collection represents number tokens words noun phrase multiple word terms assigned heavier weights single word terms multiple word terms usually convey precise semantic meaning terms 
occurrence analysis computed asymmetric similarity function follows ijk ij actor equation indicates similarity weight term term ij calculated equation 
ijk represents combined weight term descriptors document defined follows ijk tf ijk log df jk tf ijk represents smaller number occurrences term term document df jk represents number documents terms occur 
represents number words descriptor weighting factor penalize high collection frequency terms occurrence analysis actor log df log terms higher document frequency value df possibly general terms smaller weighting factor value causes occurrence probability smaller 
resulting occurrence matrix represents network noun phrases probabilistic relationships 
relationships noun phrases reflect strengths main heading mh heading assigned mesh numbers mn
