multipath protocols tora unique feature temporally ordered routing algorithm tora maintaining multiple routes destination topological changes require reaction having just single route sufficient 
protocol reacts routes destination lost 
case routes re established temporally ordered sequence diffusing computations essentially link reversals described momentarily 
event network partitions protocol able detect partition erase invalid routes 
tora part classical gafni bertsekas consider similar problem maintaining destination oriented directed acyclic graph dag face topological changes 
dag considered destination oriented node path destination 
link failures graph destination disoriented series link reversals ensue graph destination oriented finite time 
graph initially constructed route discovery construction phase source initiated fashion query flood followed update routing packets 
point maintained route maintenance phase link reversals topological change causes node lose downstream link 
destination unreachable network partition protocol erases route erasure phase invalid routes 
tora uses node height maintain destination oriented dag 
node maintains height exchanges value neighbor

note notion height link directions destination specific 
independent copies protocol runs possible destination node network 
initial route construction phase height node carries distance hops node destination 
distance information eventually lost route maintenance phase 
multiple routes maintained tora obvious question choice route 
alternatives suggested choosing neighbor randomly loads evenly distributed choosing lowest neighbor

demand protocols link state distance vector protocols primarily proactive protocols sense routes maintained potential destinations possibly nodes network time routes 
route maintenance large overhead significant amount route update traffic especially large networks 
reactive demand protocols hand create maintain routes needed basis 
route needed sort global search procedure employed 
family classical flooding algorithms belong reactive group 
examples proposed reactive protocols dsr aodv 
note tora described earlier partially reactive sense route creation initiated demand 
route maintenance done proactive basis multiple routing options available case link failures 
dsr dynamic source routing dsr uses technique source data packet determines complete sequence nodes forward packet source explicitly lists route packet header 
dsr builds routes demand flooded query packets carry sequence hops passed 
query reaches destination destination replies reply packet simply copies route query packet traverses backwards 
node assume wireless links symmetric may case practice 
dsr tolerate asymmetric links example destination back source 
consider asymmetric links evaluations 
route cache complete routes desired destinations stored gleaned response packets 
routes data packets 
route failure detected failure attempted message transmission 
failure initiates error packet sent backward source 
error packet erases routes route caches intermediate nodes path route contains failed link 
dsr unique advantage virtue source routing 
route part packet routing loops short long lived formed immediately detected eliminated 
property opens protocol variety useful optimizations 
example flooded query early having non reply query host route intended destination 
routes improved having nodes listen conversations nodes proximity 
aodv ad hoc demand distance vector protocol aodv demand variation distance vector protocols 
aodv uses destination sequence numbers dsdv determine freshness routing information 
aodv flooded requests create route destination responding request dsr 
aodv maintains routes distributed fashion routing table entries intermediate nodes route 
routing table entries tuples form destination hop distance 
nodes forwarding queries remember earlier hop taken query packet 
hop forward reply packet back source 
reply packet sets routing table entries path 
aodv advocates early quenching request packets node having route destination reply request 
aodv uses technique called route expiry routing table entry expires predetermined period fresh route discovery initiated 
aodv maintains addresses neighbors packets destined destination received 
neighbor considered active destination originates relays packet destination past active timeout period 
routing table entry active active neighbor 
path source destination active routing table entries called active path 
link failure routing table entries erased failed link active path 
accomplished error packet going backwards active neighbors forward active neighbors 
technique effectively erases route backwards failed link 
dsr aodv guarantees shortest path 
destination respond route requests early quenching route requests source node intermediate node initiator route request initial route may shortest 
depending changes topology route may remain shortest
