data follow weekly pattern technique useful pattern day shown 
overcome showing multiple graphs 
show average day pattern month day week 
information lost 
example data patterns holidays show strong similarities data patterns 
data weekday averaged separately holidays disturb results 
get precise information eliminate cross various effects graphs combinations time scales ranging january december

furthermore want detect days patterns strongly deviate standard patterns 
multiple graphs suggested implicitly assumed fixed relation distribution patterns months weekdays 
general assumption tested priori 
alternative drop assumption analysis tool decide daily patterns similar show distribution year 
basis approach cluster analysis combined calendar visualization 
cluster analysis aim merge similar day patterns clusters day patterns cluster similar day patterns clusters 
cluster contains average day pattern 
simple straightforward bottom clustering algorithm suffices 
split time series data sequence day patterns 
day pattern consists sequence pairs yi ti denotes measured value ti time elapsed midnight 
start clusters cluster containing day pattern 
compute mutual differences clusters merge clusters similar new cluster 
result active clusters 
step merging small clusters larger clusters repeated single cluster results contains average day patterns 
speed clustering procedure calculated differences clusters stored table updated new clusters 
result algorithm binary tree clusters 
various distance measures 
suppose day patterns yi zi simple measure average geometric distance root distance yi drms zi measure robust usually yields results 
want cluster patterns similar shapes normalized version yi ymax dnm zi zmax measured values normalized division maximum value sequence 
want eliminate slow trends subtract average difference 
means consider patterns equal offset yi zi yi zi interested peak values dma ymax zmax experimented measures preceding measures gave best results provide easy toolset 
cluster visualization grouped day patterns get insight result 
standard way display result clustering dendrograms shown 
bottom row shows initial elements row shows clusters combined
