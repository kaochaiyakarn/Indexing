major search engines including aol excite google infoseek er find related web pages option details algorithms publicly available 
syntactic approach finding duplicates tried ine large portion web form documents issue pages devoted automobiles focused cars considered similar 
approaches taken scale case looking similar opposed identical documents 
computing document document similarity matrix essentially requires processing self join relation docs doc word word attribute counting number words pair documents common 
syntactic clustering algorithms hand shingles sentences words reduce size self join course allows copy detection type applications 
clever algorithms exist require self join represented explicitly running time proportional size contain tuples looking similar identical documents assuming processing power say pairs second running time algorithms easily exceed days
