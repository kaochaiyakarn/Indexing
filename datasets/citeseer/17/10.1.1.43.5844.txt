identity unity individuality formal toolkit ontological analysis 
introduce notions identity unity discussed philosophy provide additional clarifications needed notions fundamental tools methodology ontology driven conceptual analysis 
show identity unity complement general notion individuality conclude example tools analysis help check ontological consistency taxonomies 
identity fundamental notions ontology related issues subtle isolating relevant ones easy task see account identity problems ordinary objects collection philosophical papers area 
particular relationship identity unity appears crucial interest ontological analysis 
notions different albeit closely related confused generic notion identity 
strictly speaking identity related problem distinguishing specific instance certain class instances means characteristic property unique instance 
unity hand related problem distinguishing parts instance rest world means unifying relation binds involving 
example asking dog problem identity asking collar part dog problem unity 
shall see notions complementary recognized kept distinct wholes say individual counted 
actual conditions support judgements concerning identity unity certain class things vary case case depending properties holding things 
find condition consistently supports identity unity judgements instances certain property say property carries identity unity condition 
course deciding depends assumptions resulting conceptualization world ontology 
example decision cats remain lose tails statues identical marble constituted ultimately result sensory system culture 
aim analysis clarify formal tools needed assumptions explicit explore logical consequences 
formal tools form foundation rigorous methodology ontology driven conceptual modeling

nicola guarino christopher welty introducing notions identity unity discussed philosophy provide additional clarifications needed methodology 
show identity unity complement general notion individuality conclude example tools analysis help check ontological consistency taxonomies 
preliminaries logically speaking identity primitive equivalence relation peculiar property allowing substitution terms logical formulas leibniz rule 
shall adopt order logic identity 
occasionally extended simple temporal logic predicates temporally indexed means extra argument 
time argument omitted certain predicate predicate assumed time invariant tp tp 
note identity relation assumed time invariant things identical identical forever 
means assuming absolute identity relative identity leibniz rule holds exceptions 
domain quantification 
extension predicates limited exists actual world exists possible world 
example predicate unicorn empty account 
special predicate express actual existence time free variables appearing formulas assumed universally quantified 
assume properties discriminating properties trivially false trivially true 
identity discussing formal structure identity conditions ics clarifications intuitive meaning may useful 
say persons ssn create puzzle 
puzzle solved recognizing incomplete descriptions person records different databases different referring individual 
statement persons rephrased descriptions person refer object 
description seen set properties apply certain object 
intuition incomplete descriptions denote object identifying property common 
depending descriptions hold time distinguish synchronic diachronic ics 
needed tell statue identical marble hole identical filler allow re identify things time 
philosophical literature identity criterion generally defined condition necessary sufficient identity 
property carries identity criterion iff formula holds suitable identity equivalence relation follows restricted equivalence relation 
formulation main problems opinion 
nature relation remains mysterious ic index respect time account difference synchronic diachronic identity 
second deciding property carries identity criterion may difficult finding necessary sufficient identity hard especially natural kinds artifacts 
framework identity intuition nature relation sameness certain property unique specific instance 
suppose stipulate persons iff fingerprint reason relation ic persons lies fact property having particular fingerprint identifying property holds exactly person 
fingerprints identifying characteristics persons 
identifying properties seen relational properties involving characteristic relation class individuals identifying characteristics 
characteristics internal individuals parts qualities external entities 
things parts qualities common related way instance may say material objects occupy spatial region 
means denotes suitable characteristic relation assume scheme instance take property set relation member scheme tells sets identical iff members 
important advantage characteristic relation holding separately relation holding 
allows take time account easily clarifying distinction synchronic diachronic identity shall synchronic criterion diachronic criterion 
sake simplicity restricting criteria times entities identified exist 
note accounting difference synchronic diachronic identity difficult may think adding temporal arguments relation case semantics quite unclear relation binds entities different times 
note synchronic identity criteria weaker diachronic ones 
instance sameness spatial location usually adopted synchronic identity criterion material objects course diachronic criterion 
possible criticism looks circular defines identity terms identity case identifying characteristics common 
observed lowe take mind ics definitions identity primitive means circularity identity criteria respect notion identity just fact life identity defined 
may ask ics informative sense identity conditions non circular respect properties involved definition 
instance lowe points davidson identity criterion events stating events causes originated causes circular sense presupposes identity causes events 
cases requirement easily met regard ics simple constraints 
objection raise general 
particular notion sameness characterizing properties capture case spatiotemporal continuity taken criterion diachronic identity 
criterion course valid general believe may hold certain entities atoms matter 
want state general scheme identity criteria overcoming problems restrictions generalize relation generic formula containing free variables course excluding trivial cases discussed section weak identity conditions philosophical literature properties carrying ic called sortals 
general linguistic counterparts nouns apple non sortals correspond adjectives red 
distinguishing sortals non sortals high practical relevance conceptual modeling tend naturally organize knowledge nouns 
unfortunately recognizing property carries specific ic difficult practice 
cases suffices recognize property carries kind ic telling exactly ic achieve goal introduce weak ics necessary sufficient identity 
words assuming unknown satisfying exists look generic relations necessarily equivalence relations satisfying non trivial way 
correspond sufficient ic necessary ic 
shall say property sortal find conditions satisfied 
way generalized previous section generalize relation formula depending general containing free variables define sufficient necessary cases follows definition sufficient identity condition property formula xy definition necessary identity condition property formula xy xy come considering sense double implication 
guarantee bound identity certain sortal arbitrary identity 
ensures trivially false 
needed guarantee conjunct relevant tautological 
unity notion unity closely tied parthood formalization requires basic definitions 
adopt mereological relation meaning proper improper part time satisfying minimal set axioms definitions adapted shown table 
differently simons mereological relation taken completely general holding domain includes individuals collections amounts matter

pp def contingent unity proper part def overlap actual existence parts antisymmetry transitivity pp pp weak addressing means certain property carry unity condition uc clarify means certain object uc 
general informal definition proposed peter simons member division object stands certain relation member member bears relation members division division certain object assumed class parts necessarily disjoint completely exhausting 
unifying relation binding members division equivalence relation 
example sharing parents 
discussion simons emphasizes aspects 
unifying relation may hold arbitrary parts just parts members division sharing parents involve parts persons directly 
second unifying relation constructed arbitrary base relation transitive closure union converse forming equivalence relation 
example starting base relation parent form equivalence relation binds elements biological species say humans 
general intuitions simons presents definitions adapted terminology definition class closed system definition object contingent integrated exists division closed system called base unifying relation generalize simons definition saying object integrated division closed system suitable equivalence relation called unifying relation 
underlined relation call holds elements certain division parts object 
unifying relation certain object construct deep unifying relation binds parts assuming def zz easily check equivalence relation equivalence relation 
position state preliminary general definition avoids mentioning suitable division definition equivalence relation 
time object contingent read definition follows time part bound parts 
non triviality condition avoids considering mereological sum contingent 
expresses condition maximal self connectedness suitable relation generalized connection 
intuition exclude connection relations trivially constructed part relation 
depending ontological nature relation may different kinds unity 
example may distinguish topological unity piece coal lump coal morphological unity ball constellation functional unity hammer 
examples show prevents having parts wholes different uc 
plural defined sum wholes 
essential unity simons touches briefly temporal issues related integrity 
prevents physical object having certain uc single time contingent 
consider instance isolated piece clay certainly certain topological unity happens attached larger piece 
hardly say topological 
may invent relation supposing piece occupies certain spatial region larger piece relation connected confined 
piece clay contingent way spatial location may change soon object moves 
define stronger notion assuming uc hold object existence assuming unity essential property definition object intrinsic time exists contingent 
important object atomic proper parts intrinsic identity relation 
position state definition property carries unity condition relation instances intrinsic wholes 
important clear carrying uc imply carrying necessary ic 
due way definition formulated 
see suppose carries uc 
may think persistence condition time candidate necessary ic satisfies 
fails satisfy qualify necessary identity condition unity just persistence condition 
individuation countability seen identity unity related independent 
fact properties may carry identity unity 
instance property carrying identity identified 
instance property carries unity 
identified say individual

careful confusing individuality singularity individual count plural 
help examples reported table discuss various combinations identity unity 
table 
examples properties carrying different ic uc combinations 
property identity unity apple apple piece apple food intrinsic red case table shows prototypical example countable property instances individuals definition countable property property carries identity unity condition 
countability practical test check property carries ic uc specific ic uc may clearly determined 
case countability intend piece self connected part admit unity 
notice case uc different apple may rely notion biological unity piece adopt maximal self connectedness 
case classical example mass sortal carries ucs assuming parts apple food arbitrarily scattered carrying ic 
ic assumed mereological extensionality food amounts food iff parts 
case shows example property trivially carries uc carrying ic 
general may practical cases want avoid committing ics certain property admitting ucs

taxonomic constraints clarifications see ics ucs may affect taxonomic organization 
result methodology developing presence conditions imposes constraints theorems descending immediately definitions relation 
due space limitations shall avoid logical notation focusing explaining relevant concepts 
case ics principle proposed lowe individual instantiate sorts different criteria identity associated believe principle illuminating formulation accurate 
consider domain geometrical figures example property polygon subsumes triangle 
necessary sufficient ic polygons having edges angles 
hand additional necessary sufficient ic triangles having edges internal angle common note condition polygons 
properties different ics ic common extensions disjoint 
point having different ics having incompatible ics 
example amount matter disjoint person admit mereological extensionality persons replace parts 
case ucs obvious constraint property carrying uc subsume carrying ucs 
complicated situation arises property carrying unity subsumes 
suppose instance wonder vase subsumed amount clay 
may think vase amount clay property satisfying suitable uc 
problem vase intrinsic corresponding property carry uc verify compatible ontological assumptions amounts clay 
forces modeler consider mean amount clay account certainly amounts clay possibility forming subsumption valid 
analysis ucs brings light common misuse subsumption relation fact constituted amounts clay subsumed 
motivating example shall briefly discuss notions defined help task ontological analysis 
scenario considering motivating example simple taxonomy concepts resulting preliminary study certain domain 
focus deceptively simple example concerning subsumption relationship concepts physical objects amounts matter 
assuming concepts extensional known ontologies take opposite positions physical object amount matter amount matter physical object wordnet example illustrates lack rigorous formal tools lead drastic inconsistencies experienced modelers 
applying analysis properties see usual account amounts matter extensional ic amounts matter iff parts uc 
usual account physical objects extensional physical objects may having different parts car new tires 
account physical objects may extensional 
case physical objects normally considered unity countable 
turning taxonomic choices presence uc physical objects prevents subsuming amounts matter 
normal account physical objects non extensional prevents subsumed amounts matter 
left case extensional physical objects may subsumed amounts matter considering analysis clay previous section violates lack unity amounts matter 
analysis tells normal account concepts amounts matter physical objects disjoint 
attempted compact rigorous formalization subtle notions identity assembling clarifying adapting philosophical insights way useful practical knowledge engineering 
clarified particular importance dealing separate sufficient necessary identity conditions constraints impose taxonomy 
shown mix unity identity help formalizing notion countable property improving previous accounts 
claim rigorous analysis identity unity assumptions offer main advantages knowledge engineer results cleaner taxonomy due semantic constraints imposed relation forces analyst ontological commitments explicit clarifying intended meaning concepts exposing hidden assumptions producing reusable ontology
