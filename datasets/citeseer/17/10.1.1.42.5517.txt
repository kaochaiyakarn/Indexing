set transactions transaction set items say transaction contains set items association rule implication form ae ae 
rule holds transaction set confidence transactions contain contain rule support transaction set transactions contain set transactions computational task mining association rules generate association rules support confidence greater user specified minimum support minimum confidence respectively

statistical significance single association view dataset consisting transactions realizations independent identically distributed random boolean vectors sampled real world distribution 
denote real world probability transaction contains itemset number transactions sample dataset contain binomial random variable success probability trials 
hypothesis testing minimum support 
minimum support requirement cast hypotheses testing framework follows 
example suppose minimum support requirement 
itemset null hypothesis test alternative hypothesis 
fraction transactions dataset contain test compare threshold value reject kinds possible errors miller truth decision true true correct type ii error reject decision reject type error correct decision selection determined bound desired probability type error called significance level 
values 
general value test result probability getting outcome extreme outcome observed value computed assumption null hypothesis true miller 
example value corresponding observed fraction equal probability assumption fraction transactions contain greater equal order compute value normal approximation poisson approximation exact binomial distribution depending actual values minimum support requirement observed support 
example suppose minimum support observed support 
normal approximation 
mean standard deviation gamma 
standard deviations greater value 
testing independence 
consider association rule sets items 
null hypothesis assume occur transactions independently 
null hypothesis st theta alternative hypothesis inequality st theta means conditional probability greater probability values assumed known sufficient accuracy value theta compute value value corresponds probability assumption independent empirical frequency set greater st don know actual values denote event included transaction intersection events corresponding fractions transactions contain respectively estimates lower value independent 

statistical significance set associations suppose testing null hypotheses denote probability rejecting true 
probability rejecting null hypotheses true delta delta delta wish smaller say suffices determine thresholds individual tests bound may small number hypotheses implicitly tested large 
null hypothesis empirical value distributed uniformly test true null hypotheses test statistics independent random variables expected value smallest value order achieve small probability rejecting true null hypothesis choose thresholds smaller 
note test independence pairs set say items value greater obviously wish achieve probability rejecting false discoveries increase probability rejecting true ones 
words attempt discover true rules increase risk false discoveries rejecting true null hypotheses 
idea false discoveries may threshold 
explain compute upper bound number hypotheses implicitly tested number estimate number false discoveries threshold 
upper bound number hypotheses 
number hypotheses implicitly testing associations algorithm typically larger just number frequent itemsets number rules generated 
understand consider set frequent pairs 
null hypothesis ij items independent 
find set frequent pairs associations algorithm counts cross product frequent items 
suppose frequent items 
roughly pairs items support counted 
algorithm throws away random tests ij remaining pairs hypotheses tested 
hand algorithm picks pairs smallest values hypotheses tested 
algorithm considers pairs highest support looks values actual number hypotheses tested readily available 
case number upper bound number hypotheses 
extend upper bound include itemsets rules items 
consider itemset frequent items include frequent pairs 
need include itemset counting number hypotheses itemset clearly minimum support dataset properties examined algorithm 
itemsets items number hypotheses product number frequent pairs times number frequent items 
fact bound number hypotheses just itemsets subsets frequent 
number exactly number candidates counted current algorithms 
summing passes get number hypotheses number candidate itemsets number frequent itemsets theta number frequent items 
set candidate itemsets includes itemset subsets frequent 
emphasize upper bound may higher necessary 
serious problem null hypotheses true test statistics clearly independent prohibiting direct calculation appropriate thresholds 
practical solution problem 

determining thresholds resampling observed singleton frequencies items generate synthetic data sets transactions model occurrences items independent 
transactions generated independently transaction item pick number ij uniform distribution include ij typically generate data sets consisting transactions 
numbers depend number frequent items minimum support number transactions

expect false discoveries place threshold estimates useful wish assess quality set rules mine real data set 
example real data set consider reporting rules values smaller threshold expect rules false discoveries purely synthetic data base null hypotheses true expected number turn small values 
value increases rules reported larger number expected false 
tried approach real life datasets characteristics shown table 
results specific minimum support confidence rule got similar results values support confidence 
table gives dataset results simulation 
results different random seeds give idea variation values 
supermarket department store data ran different data sizes transactions 
notice average values quite similar data sizes 
estimated smallest value dataset conservative upper bound number hypotheses derived previous section 
factor difference expected lowest value actual value datasets 
supermarket data rules rules values higher gamma values mail order data minimum support low get meaningful results data sizes 
transactions minimum support corresponds just transactions 

department store data rules rules values higher gamma values greater 
mail order data rules rules values greater gamma number false discoveries extremely small 
reason extremely low number false discoveries support confidence threshold excellent job pruning rules statistically significant 
instance consider rule support consequent 
rule meet minimum confidence constraint support confidence rule times expected support confidence assuming antecedent consequent independent 
minimum support extremely low rule low value 

confidence intervals denote probability binomial random variable success probability trials value greater value rule observed frequency respect desired support level equal np 
denote true frequency 
probability event gamma confidence level interval form gamma 
symmetry normal approximation allows calculating confidence intervals observed value construct rule confidence interval level rule apriori probability true frequency lies interval 
means expected proportion rules true frequency lies respective interval 
regard constructing confidence interval confidence rule argue 
general consider events ae confidence intervals level gamma ffl respectively confidence simulated number expected lowest lowest lowest dataset transactions value value value supermarket dept store mail order table simulation results interval je confidence level gamma ffl 
confidence intervals allow users associations rules predictively giving idea variance expect support confidence rule
