formal ontology precision declarative encoding support computational reasoning needed creation ontology metadata practical 
exactly capabilities available depends language chosen implement ontology knowledge base 
options complex tradeoffs ability reason various ways efficiency scalability system 
choice representation system follow vision articulated creation www umich edu ontology beethoven demo html 
new catalog section discusses issue 
implement metadata knowledge base loom description logic system kl family 
ontology metadata provide important benefits precise queries 
example consider amateur musician needs learn part 
able pose query equivalent find score beethoven fifth arranged cello recorded performance available 
similar query posed specifying particular 
traditional distinction access descriptive metadata blurred ontologybased data purposes 
attributes designated controlled vocabulary continue particularly useful access 
explicit paths vague precise queries 
vague query identifies values desired attributes 
ontologies attributes defined relations attributes providing numerous intuitively natural sequences prompting users articulate requirements 
frequently query refinement occur starting top hierarchy see section progressing downwards 
queries refined requesting increasingly specific versions known attributes adding values attributes associated known values 
integrating catalogs 
kind reasoning merge descriptions generating knowledge base applied integrate multiple catalogs 
derived predecessor look predecessor collection find generate new metadata including know predecessor 
descriptions essentially waiting fully instantiated integration catalogs include preceding works 
see section issues related scaling 
service calculation license needs

approach advantages proposals new catalog structures 
idea variations extend marc fields explicit links works 
marc highly redundant especially records 
redundant data reduces efficiency storage updating 
serious threat digital libraries prospect overwhelming users numerous versions similar works 
marc archaic file organization

need impedes utilization advances mainstream database technology 
proposals explore relational databases store new catalogs 
systems fast reliable massive quantities data 
unfortunately relational technology best suited applications banking large quantities highly standardized data 
complexity bibliographic data normalization 
normalization process data divided separate table domain entity indexed combination dimensional values provides unique key record 
bibliographic data requires descriptive dimensions partial description multiple levels granularity combination dimensions viewing perspectives access different sequences dimensional values 
relational design forces commitment particular combinations orderings dimensions 
complex domains result proliferation tables destroys efficiency maintainability 
object oriented databases appropriate complex domains 
proposed object oriented catalog model similar 
ontology object oriented class structure declaratively encoded 
typical object oriented systems class structure encoded procedurally programming language data structure

example item number materialization manifestation expression conception 
furthermore single materializations frequently linked multiple instances intermediate concepts 
example start instances mode music separately connect musical key expression 
stage far interesting 
reason relations implicit marc data explicit 
treatment considered crude pass 
effort invested developing increasingly refined rules glean additional information 
see interesting review relationships works represented past current catalogs 
frequently partial imprecise data suggests relationships confirmed 
cases assert relations considered tentative 
definition certain relations true errors false tentative relations merely false 
instances merged common identity certain 
tentatively thesame relation asserted link 
liberal tentative relations conservative certain relations 
tentative relations incorrect 
result deduction uses tentative relation tentative 
processing includes steps merge multiple instances intermediate concepts unification 
unification algorithm uses constraints part ontology definitions

third thorough solution versioning problem require experimenting implementation knowledge base 
versioning problem derives ease modifying electronic documents results proliferation similar works 
new version creates redundant metadata depending type modification 
new version requires new digitization little redundancy metadata occurs minor change content document requires new expression lower levels hierarchy duplicated 
consequences redundancy dire 
redundancy updates difficult bibliographic data change frequently 
uncontrolled redundancy opposed intentional replication wastes disk space storage requirements text inconsequential compared multimedia 
minimize software complexity desirable implement version controlled metadata instances store changes version replicating information stays 
note hierarchy imposes dimensional ordering avoid description logic reducing redundant metadata 
example defines expression manifestation digitization complementary subconcepts conception instance inherits 
model new expression creates new instance shares old manifestation digitization 
chose hierarchy structured model believe useful supporting user inquiry 
conception instance digitization manifestation expression alternative structure important issue related versioning need protect users users see similar versions similar versions 
typically user interfaces responsible summarizing metadata 
documents change ongoing manner stored version controlled form described single expression manifestation materialization associated growing lists versions publications productions respectively 
fourth undertaking production ontology metadata large scale desirable think carefully objectives system representation best support objectives 
fundamental obstacle tradeoff expressiveness ability model complex relationships tractability efficiency computations 
expressiveness tractability facets making selection representation difficult decision highly sensitive definition system objectives 
generating ontology metadata description logic expressive ways ways 
description logic greatest asset ability automatic classification algorithmic placing new concepts proper location subsumption taxonomy structure definition 
automatic classification generate knowledge base metadata important support user queries 
hand formal way reason uncertainty useful uncertainty handled description logic 
deductive object oriented databases seek combine logic support object oriented structures 
general systems inferential power description logic deducing new individuals relations appropriate library catalog 
relatively new area research consensus best approach emerged 
need worry uncertainty 
categories systems developed reason uncertainty probability possibility non monotonic logic respectively see hunter overview 
unfortunately entirely satisfactory 
sort ad hoc compromise adding tentative relations description logic unavoidable 
fifth dedicated hours discussion developing central concepts areas ontology remains provisional 
thorough ontology facilitate 
global single ontology may necessary 
currently pursuing research support communication computational agents despite local variation ontologically defined terminology 
sixth need studies users engaged inquiry prove utility ontology metadata 
require interfaces fully exploit ability knowledge base support queries 
interface available web see section designed researchers users 
big picture goal knowledge base information resources large organized sustainable 
professional cataloging community hard pressed keep flood new information 
envision knowledge sharing kinds users publishers researchers students contribute knowledge base
