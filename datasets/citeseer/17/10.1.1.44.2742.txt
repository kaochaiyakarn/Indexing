order provide hypertext links current hypertext document describing focused entity entities potential hypertext documents describing entities need assess object similarity 
similarity operate context respect statement similar simply mean entities share large number properties entity shares infinite number properties entity statement means similar certain respect 
example children photos appear similar concepts context items saved fire highly related 
computing similarity concepts particular setting need specify example domains consisting concrete objects animals jewellery simple attributes length colour complex notions appearance size 
particular domain current context taken user interest interaction rely currently focused item combination 
dynamic hypertext system incorporate current document links related concepts entities domain account context 
context mapped representation compute object similarity items potential interest 
nature vary depending current context 
recall considering documents describing particular entity concept 
example entity necklace entity ring entities weigh kg kg kg 
computation object similarity boil simple attribute match cases consider things animals scales black dresses jesse king comparisons formed instances simple illustrative comparisons case jewel jesse king 
hand situations require complex object similarity matching things appearance resulting comparison need specify objects similar case simple attribute matching delimit similarity ends 
particular context reveal similarities objects considered similar 
example context animals scales consider fish similar 
developed similarity metric takes account different types non binary nature similarity 
allows determine properties identical fact similar example material silver similar gold body covering soft fur similar wool spines

interaction spaces particularly interesting lead visitor buyer items potential interest close proximity 
constraints posed physical layout impact choice comparators linked unfolding discourse point back visited items point forward items closest proximity 
additionally purposes illustrative comparison items currently perceivable user items visited previously order description immediately accessible 
maximising coherence past discourse importance able refer back point backwards previous conversations listener specifically concepts previously described listener obvious enter conversation debate going time try reading book middle start watching movie half way 
initially new environment thoroughly confusing pick missed listening discourse history conversation debate book movie 
discourse history plays central role nlg systems particularly constructing anaphoric referring expressions red ones trying refer concepts mentioned past communication user 
dynamic hypertext system capable producing comparisons considerable discourse history 
local textual environment system reinforce relationship previous current documents linking ways concepts described refer textual coherence 
global discourse context system build concepts previously described similar way employing user model refer conceptual coherence 
textual coherence 
path user arrive particular hypertext document predicted advance 
making comparisons concepts described document effective way making coherent transition document part rhetoric arrival terms 
achieved means simpler annotations mark documents straightforward adaptive hypertext systems 
described earlier automatic generation hypertext documents effectively constitutes ongoing discourse user description provide connection described concept 
peba ii ilex systems link focused entity described entity 
example description echidna discourse initial description user user arrived echidna document short echidna document peba ii system produced linking text resulting description echidna apart short echidna echidna subtype long echidna 
ilex system currently generates linking sentences designed page item organic style 
ilex uses linking sentences current piece jewellery previously described piece order bring similarities user attention 
ways making discourse connected difficulty lies finding relevant relationship entities described hypertext documents 
document reached top system peba ii ilex introductory indices user select object instances characteristic link documents current document listed text previous document reason 
reason provides clue linking sentence 
conceptual coherence 
dynamic hypertext system longer term discourse history making comparisons concepts described user past discourse recall call pointing backward 
example describing listener easier compare dolphin comparison 
system previously described dolphin user comparison easily 
dynamically producing hypertext documents allows production shorter texts system omit links concepts longer considers relevant include links determines relevant sufficiently realise fully current document 
user requires information concepts ask follow questions selecting links 
helps alleviate problem overwhelming user text increases likelihood user read document 
peba ii system assumed user reads text displayed knowledge concepts diminishes time 
ilex pieces information re iterated depends item assimilation score indicates extent assumed known user type assimilation rate indicates ease item assimilated 
remains seen strategy prove effective possible different strategies appropriate different domains 
coherence arising system goals 
final issue related conceptual coherence worth noting 
system user dialog main aim user achieve goals 
feasible system pursue agenda servicing user needs 
sense user freedom explore information partially restricted hypertext links system chooses include 
educational systems line dias museum guides shopping catalogue systems built goals try achieve pointing user items determined important learning selling purposes interesting useful 
course systems user time return front page course entirely clear aspects concepts past discourse remembered user 
users hypertext systems browse documents skip paragraphs text 
select object described 
really free 
furthermore producing descriptions objects user requests ilex system ensures description contributes maximally user goals building coherent picture individual user 
example suppose describing item jewellery happens plastic may important allows system opportunity points agenda regard plastic cheap material generally mass produced jewellery early century difficult designer pieces 
way system goals opportunistically satisfied 
argued adding natural language generation techniques line hypertext catalogues purchases important leverage particularly wide range users systems 
particular hypertextual network nodes network documents automatically constructed customised individual user knowledge needs term result dynamic hypertext 
nlg techniques production line texts highly flexible tailored level detail possible multiple canned texts introduce significant amount variation presenting user genuinely personalised electronic catalogue builds knowledge making known concepts
