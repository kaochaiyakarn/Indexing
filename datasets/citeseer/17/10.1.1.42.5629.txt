discourse markers denoted special pos tags process pos tagging identify discourse markers 
incorporating pos tagging language modeling discourse markers identified speech recognition timeliness information help predict words 
contrast approach alternative machine learning approach proposed litman 
argues discourse markers help hearer predict role upcoming utterance plays dialog 
discourse markers provide valuable evidence automatic dialog act prediction 
discourse markers linguistic devise speakers signal upcoming unit speech text relates current discourse state 
previous computational linguistics emphasized role marking changes global discourse structure

discourse markers prominent dialogs valuable source information understanding utterances introduce 
striking feature task oriented dialog largely ignored researchers building spoken dialog systems simply regard noise cf

dialogs involve human participants playing role user certain task accomplish playing role system acting planning assistant

pos language model traditional goal speech recognition find sequence words maximal acoustic signal earlier heeman allen heeman argue view limiting 
spoken dialog system word recognition just step understanding speaker turn 
furthermore speech recognition difficult especially higher level information 
propose step incorporate pos tagging speech recognition process 
previous approaches pos tags speech recognition view pos tags intermediate objects summing pos tag sequences jelinek 
take approach redefining goal speech recognition process finds best word pos tag sequence acoustic signal 
derivation acoustic model language model follows

rewrite pr wp pr number words sequence 
rewrite language model probability follows 
pr pr ip ijw pr ijw pr ijw final probability distributions similar previous attempts pos tags language modeling jelinek pos tagging written text charniak church derose 
approaches simplify probability distributions shown approximations 
pr ijw pr pr ijw pr shown earlier heeman allen heeman simplifications lead poor language models 
probability distributions probability distributions need estimated 
simplest approach estimating probability event context relative frequency event occurs context training corpus 
matter large training corpus event context pairs seen seen rarely accurately estimate probability 
alleviate problem partition contexts smaller number equivalence classes equivalence classes compute relative frequencies 
decision tree learning algorithm bahl black breiman uses information theoretic measures construct equivalence classes context order cope sparseness data 
decision tree algorithm starts training data single leaf node 
leaf node looks question ask context splitting node leaf nodes results biggest decrease impurity impurity measures leaf predicts events node 
heldout data decide growing tree split rejected split result decrease impurity respect heldout data 
tree grown heldout dataset smooth probabilities node parent bahl 
allow decision tree ask questions words pos tags context questions generalize words pos tags behave similarly cluster words pos tags algorithm brown 
binary classification tree 
algorithm starts word pos tag separate class successively merges classes result smallest lost mutual information terms cooccurrences classes 
keeping track order classes merged construct hierarchical classification classes 
shows pos classification tree automatically built training data 
note classification algorithm clustered discourse marker pos tags close classification tree 
binary classification tree gives implicit binary encoding pos tag determined sequence top bottom edges leads root node node pos tag 
binary encoding allows decision tree ask words pos tags simple binary questions third bit pos tag encoding equal pos tag
