augmented reality systems focused augmenting visual information overlaying visual image environment additional information usually text 
common configuration systems hand held device pointed objects environment 
video image overlays displayed small window 
handheld systems require user actively probe environment indirectly view representation environment video screen 
system offers primary distinctions 
users actively probe environment

serendipitous information informal observation colleagues devised scenarios audio aura guided design 
scenarios touched issues system responsiveness privacy complexity abstractness information 
scenario grew need different types serendipitous information 
email oriented culture newly arrived email concerns important 
people run offices meetings check important communication pipeline 
common activity dropping get cup coffee tea 
obvious tension linger coffee chat colleagues go check latest email messages 
decided tie activities 
main exception managers shift voice mail 

enter hear cue conveys approximately new email messages indicates messages particular people groups 
second people tend opportunistically drop people offices 
practice supports communication email message phone call inappropriate time consuming 
opportunistic visitor faced empty office may quickly survey office trying determine desired person day 
audio aura visitor hears auditory cue conveying person day gone time just missed 
important note cues qualitative 
report office hours minutes cue gives sense akin seeing light briefcase desk hearing passing colleague report person just seen walking conference room

continuous sound group pulse backdrop audio aura cues 
sound design section discuss design issues related constructing sounds audio aura 
created sets ecologies auditory cues scenarios 
sound crafted attention frequency content structure interaction sounds 
explore range preference created sound environments composed sound ecologies 
sound selections email quantity group pulse summarized tables 
design intent sonic ecologies intend system background interaction design auditory cues avoid alarm paradigm frequently computational environments 
alarm sounds tend sharp attacks high volume levels substantial frequency content general range human voice hz 
sound computer interfaces inadvertently fit model 
deliberately aiming auditory periphery sounds sound environments designed avoid triggering alarm responses listeners 
aspect design approach construction sonic ecologies changing behavior audio aura system interpreted semantic roles sounds play 
example particular sets functionalities mapped various beach sounds 
current sound effects design amount email mapped cries email particular people groups mapped various beach birds seals group activity level mapped surf wave volume activity audio footprints mapped number buoy bells 
idea exploring sonic ecologies cues running low level soundtrack user sudden sound 
running track carries information global levels activity building group network 
group pulse sound forms bed auditory information lie 
structure individual sounds useful aspect ecological approach sound design considering frequency bandwidth human perception limited resources 
design perspective build sounds attention perceptual niche sound resides 
design model tried different types sounds varying harmonic content pitch attack decay rhythms caused simultaneously looping sounds different lengths 
example looping long low pitched sounds high harmonic content long gentle attacks decays create sonic background leave room sounds effectively heard 
music environment sound low clear vibe sound sound effects environment distant surf 
sounds share sonic attributes described 
types aural environments audio aura system offers range sound designs voice music sound effects rich sound environment types sound 
different types auditory cues mapped type events afford different levels specificity required awareness 
vocal labels example provide familiar auditory feedback time usually demand attention non speech sound 
speech tends carry foreground information may appropriate user location seconds 
user simply walking area sounds remain peripheral level volume semantic content
