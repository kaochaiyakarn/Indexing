alternative scrollbars small screens bj rk johan play applied research art technology institute box se gothenburg sweden johan informatics gu se informatics gu se groups play describes web browser focus context technique flip zooming 
prototype developed evaluated ordinary web browser scrollbars small screen resolution pixels 
preliminary evaluation show prototype provides better overview searching specific items easier compared traditional browser 
findings indicate constraints acknowledged designing user interface small screens 
keywords information visualization focus context techniques small screens flip zooming dramatically increased growth mobile information technology personal digital assistants pda cellular phones raises new questions interface usability 
web browsers developed ordinary screens scrollbars order enable users explore page large fit screen 
strategy useful designing small develop techniques 
project aims exploring alternative scrollbars focus context technique means designing small screens 
focus context visualization techniques collectively termed focus context visualization techniques attempt give users overview detailed focus time 
enables users move center attention different areas maintaining overview 
visualization technique generalized fisheye view provided basis subsequent 
examples include continuous zoom perspective wall document lens 
flip zooming focus context technique flip zooming users navigate data set flipping individual pieces flipping pages book 
entry examined detail selected clicking representation item 
image item zoomed readable size 
surrounding items reduced size re arranged 
image browser original flip zooming technique accommodate expanded focus image 
distortion images decreased size 
ways switching new entry 
user switch entries click directly entry question keyboard shortcut go previous entry sequence 
focused object occupy entire screen space user wishes view detail 
focus context visualization small screens goal transfer possibly modify flip zooming technique browsing web pages pda main problem create visualization page fit available screen size 
allowed resolution set pixels 
early design phase decided stack card metaphors frameworks wireless web access wireless application protocol 
web pages hierarchies stacks containing cards 
card defined object small fit allowed screen size 
flip zooming small screens prerequisite web page divided cards achieved ways layout markup structure html tags textual structure analyzed simple token counts surface syntax 
decided try algorithm divide page cards similar length simple lexical analysis 

prototype browser traditional browser pixel display alternative views original flip zooming technique transfer new screen format context objects small 
small readable support recognition user seen card question 
provided overview page browsed 
order support time intermittent browsing developed prototype utilizes different views objects 
summary keywords basic term frequency keyword extraction algorithms compact summary words content card created 
words letter size bigger easier read card question focus 
hypertext links extracted hypertext links individual cards view showing solely links order provide help searching specific links get overview existing links 
switching views alternative views user switch inspecting objects graphical objects reading short summaries means keywords alternatively shape links contain 
reason introducing views project worked assumption web browsers small screens focused retrieving specific important information general surfing 
evaluation wished find strength limitations prototype web browser performed preliminary formative evaluation prototype compared browser uses scrollbars 
size display area browsers set pixels navigation toolbars menus search functions available 
applications showed web page 
subjects asked find specific items material different search strategies possible browsers 
completing tasks subjects asked fill questionnaire qualitative quantitative 
keyword view link view prototype browser questions 
subjects students familiar computers consisted males females 
users thought flip zooming technique took time 
evaluation indicated prototype provided better overview traditional browser mean difference scale confidence interval 
searching easier focus context technique mean difference finding text input field confidence interval 
evaluation indicates focus context technique promising alternative scrollbars small screens especially providing overview 
evaluating prototype ordinary screens reveal similarities differences desktop sized screens smaller counterparts constraints small screens put interaction design
