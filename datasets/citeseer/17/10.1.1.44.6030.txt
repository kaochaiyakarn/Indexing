solution proposed metadata describe data contained web 
metadata data data example library catalog metadata describes publications specifically context specification data describing web resources 
distinction data metadata absolute distinction created primarily particular application times resource interpreted ways simultaneously 
resource description framework rdf foundation processing metadata provides interoperability applications exchange machine understandable information web 
rdf emphasizes facilities enable automated processing web resources 
rdf variety application areas example resource discovery provide better search engine capabilities cataloging describing content content relationships available particular web site page digital library intelligent software agents facilitate knowledge sharing exchange content rating describing collections pages represent single logical document describing intellectual property rights web pages expressing privacy preferences user privacy policies web site 
rdf digital signatures key building web trust electronic commerce collaboration applications 
document introduces model representing rdf metadata syntax encoding transporting metadata manner maximizes interoperability independently developed web servers clients 
syntax uses extensible markup language xml goals rdf possible specify semantics data xml standardized interoperable manner 
rdf xml complementary rdf model metadata superficially addresses encoding issues transportation file storage require character sets 
issues rdf relies support xml 
important understand xml syntax possible syntax rdf alternate ways represent rdf data model may emerge 
broad goal rdf define mechanism describing resources assumptions particular application domain defines priori semantics application domain 
definition mechanism domain neutral mechanism suitable describing information domain 
specification followed documents complete framework 
importantly facilitate definition metadata rdf class system object oriented programming modeling systems 
collection classes typically authored specific purpose domain called schema 
classes organized hierarchy offer extensibility subclass refinement 
way order create schema slightly different existing necessary reinvent wheel just provide incremental modifications base schema 
sharability schemas rdf support reusability metadata definitions 
due rdf incremental extensibility agents processing metadata able trace origins schemata unfamiliar back known schemata perform meaningful actions metadata weren originally designed process 
sharability extensibility rdf allows metadata authors multiple inheritance mix definitions provide multiple views data leveraging done 
addition possible create rdf instance data multiple schemata multiple sources interleaving different types metadata

basic rdf 
basic rdf model foundation rdf model representing named properties property values 
rdf model draws established principles various data representation communities 
rdf properties may thought attributes resources sense correspond traditional attribute value pairs 
rdf properties represent relationships resources rdf model resemble entity relationship diagram 
precisely rdf schemas instances rdf data models er diagrams 
object oriented design terminology resources correspond objects properties correspond instance variables 
rdf data model syntax neutral way representing rdf expressions 
data model representation evaluate equivalence meaning 
rdf expressions equivalent data model representations 
definition equivalence permits syntactic variation expression altering meaning 
basic data model consists object types resources things described rdf expressions called resources 
resource may entire web page html document www org overview html example 
resource may part web page specific html xml element document source 
resource may collection pages entire web site 
resource may object directly accessible web printed book 
resources named uris plus optional anchor ids see uri 
uri extensibility uris allows identifiers entity imaginable 
properties property specific aspect characteristic attribute relation describe resource 
property specific meaning defines permitted values types resources describe relationship properties 
document address characteristics properties expressed information refer rdf schema specification 
statements specific resource named property plus value property resource rdf statement 
individual parts statement called respectively subject predicate object 
object statement property value resource literal resource specified uri simple string primitive datatype defined xml 
rdf terms literal may content xml markup evaluated rdf processor 
syntactic restrictions markup literals may expressed see section 

examples resources identified resource identifier

basic rdf syntax rdf data model provides conceptual framework defining metadata 
concrete syntax needed purposes creating exchanging metadata 
specification rdf uses extensible markup language xml encoding interchange syntax 
rdf requires xml namespace facility precisely associate property schema defines property see section schemas namespaces 
syntax descriptions document extended backus naur form notation defined section notation xml describe essential rdf syntax elements 
ebnf condensed human readability particular italicized rdf represent variable namespace prefix precise bnf notation 
requirement property type names tags exactly match names corresponding start tags implied xml rules 
syntactic xml implicitly included whitespace rules quoting single quote double quote character escaping case sensitivity language tagging 
specification defines xml syntaxes encoding rdf data model instance 
serialization syntax expresses full capabilities data model regular fashion 
abbreviated syntax includes additional constructs provide compact form represent subset data model 
rdf interpreters expected implement full serialization syntax abbreviated syntax 
consequently metadata authors free mix 

basic serialization syntax single rdf statement seldom appears isolation commonly properties resource 
rdf xml syntax designed accomodate easily grouping multiple statements resource description element 
description element names attribute resource statements apply 
resource exist resource identifier description element create resource id attribute 
basic rdf serialization syntax takes form rdf description description uri id value value description string resource uri name uri string interpreted uri legal xml name symbol name legal xml name symbol legal xml namespace prefix string xml text escaped rdf element simple wrapper marks boundaries xml document content explicitly intended rdf data model instance 
rdf element optional content known rdf application context 
description contains remaining elements cause creation statements model instance 
description element may thought purposes basic rdf syntax simply place hold identification resource described 
typically statement resource description provides way give resource name just statements 
attribute specified description statements description refer resource identifier determined 
value attribute interpreted uri section uri 
corresponding resource identifier obtained resolving uri absolute form specified uri 
fragment identifier included uri resource identifier refers subcomponent containing resource corresponding anchor id internal containing resource see dexter identifier refers entire resource specified uri 
description element attribute creates new resource 
resource surrogate proxy physical resource recognizable uri 
value id attribute description element anchor id line resource 
description property value needs refer line resource value id resource attribute 
id attribute signals creation new resource attribute refers existing resource id may specified description element 
values id attribute appear id attribute single document 
single description may contain element property name 
adds arc graph 
interpretation graph defined schema designer 
resource attribute specifies resource value property object statement resource identified uri literal 
resource identifier object obtained resolving resource attribute uri manner attribute 
strings formed xml usual xml content quoting escaping mechanisms may string contains character sequences version rdf supported mechanism specify value property xml content containing markup escaping markup writing property attribute form shown section 
property names associated schema 
done qualifying element names namespace prefix unambiguously connect property definition corresponding rdf schema declaring default namespace specified namespaces 
example sentence section ora lassila creator resource www org home lassila represented rdf xml ora lassila namespace prefix refers specific namespace prefix chosen author rdf expression defined xml namespace declaration xmlns description org schema namespace declaration typically included xml attribute rdf rdf element may included particular description element individual expression 
namespace name uri namespace declaration globally unique identifier particular schema metadata author define creator property 
schemas may define property named creator properties distinguished schema identifiers 
note schema usually defines properties single namespace declaration suffice large vocabulary properties available 
complete xml document containing description xmlns rdf www org tr wd rdf syntax xmlns description org schema ora lassila default namespace syntax defined namespaces rdf namespace document written xmlns www org tr wd rdf syntax xmlns description org schema ora lassila furthermore namespace declarations associated individual description element individual element ora lassila xml namespace declarations may nested previous example may condensed ora lassila highly condensed expressions discouraged rdf xml encoding written hand expected plain text editor 
unambiguous possibility error greater explicit prefixes consistently 
note rdf xml fragment intended inserted documents declare namespaces uses completely self contained 
readability introductory examples remainder section omit namespace declarations order obscure specific points illustrated 

basic abbreviated syntax serialization syntax shows structure rdf model clearly desirable compact xml form 
rdf abbreviated syntax accomplishes 
benefit abbreviated syntax allows documents obeying certain structured xml dtds directly interpreted rdf models 
forms abbreviation defined basic serialization syntax 
useable properties repeated description values properties literals 
case properties may written xml attributes description element 
previous example creator ora lassila note description element content creator property written xml attribute form xml empty element syntax employed elide description tag 
example abbreviation form world wide web consortium home page equivalent rdf purposes publisher world wide web consortium title home page date note rdf expressions equivalent may treated differently processing engines 
particular expressions embedded html document default behavior non rdf aware browser display values properties case second case text displayed whitespace character 
second rdf abbreviation form works nested description elements 
abbreviation form employed specific statements object statement resource values properties line second resource strings 
case similar transformation xml element names xml attributes properties resource nested description may written xml attributes element description contained 
second example sentence section individual referred employee id named ora lassila email address lassila org 
resource www org home lassila created individual 
written rdf xml explicit serialization form rdf resource www org ora lassila lassila org form clear reader separate resources described clear second resource description 
expression written way relationship obvious human reader 
note machine difference ora lassila lassila org second basic abbreviation syntax inner description element contained property expressions written attributes creator element rdf resource www org name ora lassila email lassila org abbreviation form attribute nested description element resource attribute element resource named uri cases value creator property 
entirely matter writer preference forms rdf source 
produce internal rdf models 
note reader studied remainder document see additional relationships created description element preserve specific syntactic grouping statements 
consequently forms slightly different ways important discussion section 
differences important making higher order statements described section 
third basic abbreviation applies common case description element containing type property see section meaning type 
case resource type defined schema corresponding value type property directly element name 
example previous rdf fragment wanted add fact resource www org represents instance person write full serialization syntax resource person ora lassila lassila org third abbreviated form ora lassila lassila org ebnf basic abbreviated syntax replaces productions grammar basic serialization syntax manner description value string embedded quotes escaped property 
schemas namespaces write sentence natural language words meant convey certain meaning 
meaning crucial understanding statements case applications rdf crucial establishing correct processing occurs intended 
crucial writer reader statement understand meaning terms creator copyright confusion result 
medium global scale world wide web sufficient rely shared cultural understanding concepts pays precise possible 
meaning rdf expressed schema 
think schema kind dictionary 
schema defines terms rdf statements gives specific meanings 
variety schema forms rdf including specific form defined separate document rdfschema specific characteristics help automating tasks rdf 
schema place definitions restrictions usage properties documented 
order avoid confusion independent possibly conflicting definitions term rdf uses xml namespace facility 
namespaces simply way tie specific word context dictionary schema intended definition 
rdf predicate statement identified exactly namespace schema 
description element may contain statements predicates schemas 
examples rdf descriptions schema appear section 

qualified property values value property additional contextual information considered part value 
words need qualify property values 
examples qualification include naming unit measure particular restricted vocabulary annotation 
uses appropriate property value qualifiers 
example statement price pencil cents sufficient say simply price pencil 
rdf model qualified property value simply instance structured value 
object original statement structured value qualifiers properties common resource 
principal value qualified value value property common resource 
see section 
non binary relations example value property 

containers frequently necessary refer collection resources example say created person list students course software modules package 
rdf containers hold lists resources literals 

container model rdf defines types container objects bag unordered list resources literals 
bags declare property multiple values significance order values 
bag give list part numbers order processing parts matter 
duplicate values permitted 
sequence ordered list resources literals 
sequence declare property multiple values order values significant 
sequence example preserve alphabetical ordering values 
duplicate values permitted 
alternative list resources literals represent alternatives single value property 
alternative provide alternative language translations title provide list internet mirror sites resource 
application property value alternative collection aware choose items list appropriate 
note definitions bag sequence explicitly permit duplicate values 
rdf define core concept set bag duplicates rdf core mandate enforcement mechanism event violations constraints 
layered rdf core may define facilities 
create collection resources rdf uses additional resource represents specific collection instance collection object modeling terminology 
resource declared instance container object types defined 
type property defined declaration 
membership relation container resource resources belong collection defined set properties defined expressly purpose 
membership properties named simply container resources may properties addition membership properties type property

container syntax rdf container syntax takes form container sequence bag alternative sequence member bag member alternative member member value containers may description permitted rdf obj value obj string obj description container note rdf xml uses li convenience element avoid having explicitly number member 
li element assigns properties necessary 
alt container required member

embedding html recommended technique embedding rdf expressions html document simply insert rdf line shown example 
resulting document non conformant html specifications including html expects html specification evolve support 
practical issues arise technique employed respect browsers conforming specifications html including html 
alternatives available authors cases see
