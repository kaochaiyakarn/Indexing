long unix ran pdp doug mcilroy created new system higher level language implementation mcclure tmg mcclure 
tmg language writing compilers generally top recursive descent style combines context free syntax notation procedural elements 
mcilroy bob morris tmg write early pl compiler multics 
challenged mcilroy feat reproducing tmg thompson decided unix possibly named needed system programming language 
rapidly attempt fortran created language called thought types accurately bcpl squeezed bytes memory filtered thompson brain

bon turn named wife bonnie encyclopedia quotation manual religion rituals involve magic formulas 
origins languages bcpl designed martin richards mid visiting mit early interesting projects os operating system oxford stoy parts seminal alto xerox parc thacker

original bcpl compiler transported multics ge system bell labs final multics life bell labs immediately language choice group people involved unix 
bcpl fit firmly traditional procedural family typified fortran ritchie development algol 
particularly oriented system programming small compactly described amenable translation simple compilers 
close machine abstractions introduce readily grounded concrete data types operations supplied conventional computers rely library routines input output interactions operating system 
success library procedures specify interesting control constructs coroutines procedure closures 
time abstractions lie sufficiently high level care portability machines achieved 
bcpl differ syntactically details broadly similar 
programs consist sequence global declarations function procedure declarations 
procedures nested bcpl may refer non static objects defined containing procedures 
avoid restriction imposing severe nested procedures 
languages earliest versions recognizes separate compilation provides means including text named files 
syntactic lexical mechanisms bcpl elegant regular example bcpl procedure data declarations uniform structure supplies complete set looping constructs 
bcpl programs supplied stream characters clever rules allow semicolons elided statements line boundary 
omit convenience statements semicolons 
spite differences statements operators bcpl map directly corresponding structural differences bcpl stemmed limitations intermediate memory 
example bcpl declarations may take form command command command program text represented commands contains procedures 
connected occur simultaneously name known inside procedure 
similarly bcpl package group declarations statements expression yields value example valof declarations commands bcpl compiler readily handled constructs storing analyzing parsed representation entire program memory producing output 
storage limitations compiler demanded pass technique output generated soon possible syntactic redesign possible carried forward certain pleasant aspects bcpl owed technological problems consciously avoided design example bcpl uses global vector mechanism communicating separately compiled programs 
scheme programmer explicitly associates name externally visible procedure data object numeric offset global vector linkage accomplished compiled code numeric offsets 
inconvenience initially insisting entire program compiler 
implementations conventional linker resolve external names occurring files compiled separately placing burden assigning offsets programmer 
transition bcpl introduced matter taste remain controversial example decision single character assignment 
similarly uses enclose comments bcpl uses ignore text line 
legacy pl evident 
bcpl comment convention 
fortran influenced syntax declarations declarations specifier auto static followed list names followed style ritchie development placing type keywords start declarations 
difference bcpl language documented richards book richards deliberate started earlier version bcpl richards 
example endcase escapes bcpl statement language learned overloading break keyword escape switch statement owes divergent evolution conscious change 
contrast pervasive syntax variation occurred creation core semantic content bcpl type structure expression evaluation rules remained intact 
languages typeless single data type word cell fixed length bit pattern 
memory languages consists linear array cells meaning contents cell depends operation applied 
operator example simply adds operands machine integer add instruction arithmetic operations equally unconscious actual meaning operands 
memory linear array possible interpret value cell index array bcpl supplies operator purpose 
original language spelled rv uses unary 
cell containing index address pointer cell refers contents pointed cell value expression target assignment 
pointers bcpl merely integer indices memory array arithmetic meaningful address cell address cell 
convention basis semantics arrays languages 
bcpl writes vec auto effect cell named allocated group contiguous cells set aside memory index placed general rule expression adds refers th location bcpl add special notation array accesses equivalent expression bcpl approach arrays unusual time assimilate conventional way 
bcpl supports character data strongly language treats strings vectors integers supplements general rules conventions 
bcpl string literal denotes address static area initialized characters string packed cells 
bcpl packed byte contains number characters string count strings terminated special character spelled 
change partially avoid limitation length string caused holding count bit slot partly maintaining count experience convenient terminator 
individual characters bcpl string usually manipulated spreading string array character cell provided corresponding routines people library functions accessed replaced individual characters string 
ritchie development history tmg version working thompson rewrote bootstrapping step 
development continually struggled memory limitations language addition inflated compiler barely fit rewrite advantage feature reduced size 
example introduced generalized assignment operators add notation came algol wijngaarden mcilroy incorporated version tmg 
early operator spelled mistake repaired induced easy way handling form lexical analyzer 
thompson went step inventing operators increment decrement prefix postfix position determines alteration occurs noting value operand 
earliest versions appeared way 
people guess created auto increment auto decrement address modes provided dec pdp unix popular 
historically impossible pdp developed 
pdp auto increment memory cells property indirect memory incremented cell 
feature probably suggested operators thompson generalization prefix postfix 
auto increment cells directly implementation operators stronger motivation innovation probably observation translation smaller 
compiler pdp generate machine instructions threaded code bell interpretive scheme compiler output consists sequence addresses code fragments perform elementary operations 
operations typically particular act simple stack machine 
pdp unix system things written machine small slow experiment rewriting operating system utilities wholly expensive step feasible 
point thompson relieved address space crunch offering virtual compiler allowed interpreted program occupy bytes paging code data interpreter slow practical common utilities 
utilities written appeared including early version variable precision calculator dc familiar unix users mcilroy 
ambitious enterprise undertook genuine cross compiler translated ge machine instructions threaded code 
small tour de force full compiler written language generating code bit mainframe ran bit machine words user address space 
project possible simplicity language run time system

languages influenced fun things

notable results period steve johnson version yacc parser generator johnson 
problems machines bcpl word addressed languages single data type cell comfortably equated hardware machine word 
advent pdp exposed inadequacies semantic model 
mechanisms inherited changes bcpl clumsy library procedures spread packed strings individual cells access replace individual characters began feel awkward silly byte oriented machine 
second original pdp provide floating point arithmetic manufacturer promised soon available 
floating point operations added bcpl multics compilers defining special operators mechanism possible relevant machines single word large contain floating point number true bit pdp 
bcpl model implied overhead dealing pointers language rules defining pointer index array words forced pointers represented word indices 
pointer generated run time scale conversion pointer byte address expected hardware 
reasons typing scheme necessary cope characters byte addressing prepare coming floating point hardware 
issues particularly type safety interface checking important 
aside problems language compiler threaded code technique yielded programs slower assembly language counterparts discounted possibility recoding operating system central utilities began extend language adding character type rewrote compiler generate pdp machine instructions threaded code 
transition contemporaneous creation compiler capable producing programs fast small compete assembly language 
called slightly extended language nb new 
embryonic nb existed briefly full description written 
supplied types int char arrays pointers declared style typified int char int int char char semantics arrays remained exactly bcpl declarations create cells dynamically initialized value pointing sequence integers characters respectively 
declarations omit size assert storage allocated automatically 
procedures language interpretation pointers identical array variables pointer declaration created cell differing array declaration programmer expected assign referent letting compiler allocate space initialize cell 
values stored cells bound array pointer names machine addresses ritchie development measured bytes corresponding storage area 
indirection pointer implied run time overhead scale pointer word byte offset 
hand machine code array subscripting pointer arithmetic depended type array pointer compute implied scaling addend size object referred 
semantics represented easy transition experimented months 
problems evident tried extend type notation especially add structured record types 
structures map intuitive way memory machine structure containing array place pointer containing base array convenient way arrange initialized 
example directory entries early unix systems described struct int char name wanted structure merely characterize object describe collection bits read directory 
compiler hide pointer name semantics demanded 
structures thought abstractly space pointers hidden handle technical problem properly initializing pointers allocating complicated object specified structures containing arrays containing structures arbitrary depth 
solution constituted crucial jump evolutionary chain typeless bcpl typed eliminated materialization pointer storage caused creation pointer array name mentioned expression 
rule survives today values array type converted appear expressions pointers objects making array 
invention enabled existing code continue despite underlying shift language semantics 
programs assigned new values array name adjust origin possible bcpl meaningless easily repaired 
important new language retained coherent workable unusual explanation semantics arrays opening way comprehensive type structure 
second innovation clearly distinguishes predecessors fuller type structure especially expression syntax declarations 
nb offered basic types int char arrays pointers ways composition 
generalization required object type possible describe new object gathers array yields function pointer 
object composed type way mention underlying object index array call function indirection operator pointer 
analogical reasoning led declaration syntax names mirroring expression syntax names typically appear 
int pi ppi declare integer pointer integer pointer pointer integer 
syntax declarations reflects observation pi ppi yield int type expression 
similarly int declare function returning integer function returning pointer integer pointer function returning integer int api pai declare array pointers integers pointer array integers 
cases ritchie development declaration variable resembles usage expression type named head declaration 
scheme type composition adopted owes considerable debt algol emerge form algol approve 
central notion captured algol type structure atomic types including structures composed arrays pointers functions procedures 
algol concept unions casts influence appeared 
creating type system associated syntax compiler new language felt deserved new name nb insufficiently distinctive 
decided follow single letter style called leaving open question name represented progression alphabet letters bcpl 
neonatal rapid changes continued language named example operators 
bcpl evaluation expressions depends context conditional statements compare expression value zero languages place special interpretation operators 
ordinary contexts operate bitwise statement compiler evaluate non zero evaluate non zero elaborate statement dependent 
requirement descends recursively operators 
short circuit semantics boolean operators truth value context desirable overloading operators difficult explain 
suggestion alan snyder introduced operators mechanism explicit 
tardy explains precedence rules 
writes check equals non zero conditional expression better lower precedence 
converting wants replace statement conversion painful decided keep precedence operator relative merely split precedence slightly 
today preferable move relative precedences simplify common idiom test masked value value write mask inner parentheses required easily forgotten 
changes occurred important preprocessor partly alan snyder snyder recognition utility file inclusion mechanisms available bcpl pl original version exceedingly simple provided included files simple string replacements include define parameterless macros

steve johnson began pcc compiler intended easy retarget new machines johnson thompson began move unix system computer 
language changes period especially largely focused considerations portability type safety effort cope problems observed moving considerable body code new platform 
time manifested strong signs typeless origins 
pointers example barely distinguished integral memory indices early language manuals extant code similarity arithmetic properties character pointers unsigned integers hard resist temptation identify 
unsigned types added unsigned arithmetic available confusing pointer manipulation 
similarly early language assignments integers pointers practice began discouraged notation type conversions called casts example algol invented specify type conversions explicitly 
example pl early tie structure pointers firmly structures pointed permitted programmers write pointer member regard type pointer expression taken region memory designated pointer member name specified offset type 
edition described rules brought type structure form programs written older relaxed style persisted compilers tolerated

committee took cautious conservative view language extensions

ansi committee realized mere standard world change 
introduced genuinely important change language incorporated types formal arguments type signature function syntax borrowed stroustrup 
old style external functions declared double sin says sin function returning double double precision floatingpoint value 
new style better rendered double sin double argument type explicit encourage better type checking appropriate conversion 
addition produced noticeably better language caused difficulties 
committee justifiably felt simply old style function definitions declarations feasible agreed new forms better 
inevitable compromise language definition complicated permitting forms writers portable software contend compilers brought standard 
introduced host smaller additions adjustments example type ritchie development qualifiers const volatile slightly different type promotion rules 
standardization process change character language

critique ideas characteristic languages class relationship arrays pointers way declaration syntax mimics expression syntax 
frequently criticized features serve stumbling blocks beginner 
cases historical accidents mistakes exacerbated difficulty 
important tolerance compilers errors type 
clear history evolved typeless languages 
suddenly appear earliest users developers entirely new language rules ritchie development continually adapt existing programs language developed allowance existing body code 
ansi committee standardizing face problem 
compilers complain usages assigning integers pointers objects wrong type refer structure members 
language definition edition reasonably completely coherent treatment type rules book admitted existing compilers didn enforce 
rules designed ease early transitions contributed confusion 
example empty square brackets function declaration int int 
living fossil nb way declaring pointer special case interpreted pointer 
notation survived part sake compatibility part allow programmers communicate readers intent pass pointer generated array single integer 
unfortunately serves confuse learner alert reader 
supplying arguments proper type function call responsibility programmer extant compilers check type agreement 
failure original language include argument types type signature function significant weakness required committee painful innovation repair 
early design explained justified avoidance technological problems especially cross checking separately compiled source files incomplete assimilation implications moving untyped typed language 
lint program mentioned tried alleviate problem functions lint checks consistency coherency program scanning set source files comparing types function arguments calls definitions 
accident syntax contributed perceived complexity language 
indirection operator spelled syntactically unary prefix operator just bcpl works simple expressions complex cases parentheses required direct parsing 
example distinguish indirection value returned function calling function designated pointer writes fp pf respectively 
style expressions carries declarations names declared int fp int pf realistic cases things worse int pfp pointer function returning pointer integer 
effects occurring 
important relatively rich set ways describing types compared say pascal 
declarations languages expressive algol example describe objects equally hard understand simply objects complex 
second effect owes details syntax 
declarations read inside style find difficult grasp anderson 
sethi sethi observed nested declarations expressions simpler indirection operator taken postfix operator prefix late change 
spite difficulties believe approach declarations remains plausible am comfortable useful unifying principle 
characteristic feature treatment arrays suspect practical grounds real virtues 
relationship pointers arrays unusual learned 
language shows considerable power describe important concepts example vectors length varies run time basic rules conventions 
particular character strings handled mechanisms ritchie development array plus convention null character terminates string 
interesting compare approach nearly contemporaneous languages algol pascal jensen 
arrays algol fixed bounds flexible considerable mechanism required language definition compilers accommodate flexible arrays compilers fully implement 
original pascal fixed sized arrays strings proved confining kernighan 
partially fixed resulting language universally available 
treats strings arrays characters conventionally terminated marker 
aside special rule initialization string literals semantics strings fully subsumed general rules governing arrays result language simpler describe translate incorporating string unique data type 
costs accrue approach certain string operations expensive designs application code library routine occasionally search string built operations available burden storage management strings falls heavily user 
approach strings works 
hand treatment arrays general just strings unfortunate implications optimization extensions 
prevalence pointers programs declared explicitly arising arrays means optimizers cautious careful dataflow techniques achieve results 
sophisticated compilers understand pointers possibly change important usages remain difficult analyze 
example functions pointer arguments derived arrays hard compile efficient code vector machines seldom possible determine argument pointer overlap data referred argument accessible externally 
fundamentally definition specifically describes semantics arrays changes extensions treating arrays primitive objects permitting operations wholes hard fit existing language 
extensions permit declaration multidimensional arrays size determined dynamically entirely straightforward macdonald ritchie easier write numerical libraries covers important uses strings arrays arising practice uniform simple mechanism leaves problems highly efficient implementations extensions 
smaller exist language description discussed course 
general criticisms transcend detailed points 
chief language generally expected environment provide little help writing large systems 
naming structure provides main levels external visible internal single procedure 
intermediate level visibility single file data procedures weakly tied language definition 
little direct support modularization project designers forced create conventions 
similarly provides durations storage automatic objects exist control resides procedure static existing execution program 
stack dynamically allocated storage provided library routine burden managing placed programmer hostile automatic garbage collection 
success 
successful extent far surpassing early expectations 
qualities contributed widespread 
doubtless success unix important factor language available hundreds thousands people 
conversely course unix consequent portability wide variety machines important system success 
language invasion environments suggests fundamental merits 
despite aspects mysterious beginner occasionally adept ritchie development remains simple small language translatable simple small compilers 
types operations grounded provided real machines people computers learning idioms generating time space efficient programs difficult 
time language sufficiently abstracted machine details program portability achieved 
equally important central library support remained touch real environment 
designed isolation prove point serve example tool write programs useful things meant interact larger operating system regarded tool build larger tools 
parsimonious pragmatic approach influenced things went covers essential needs programmers try supply 
despite changes undergone published description admittedly informal incomplete actual language seen millions users different compilers remained remarkably stable unified compared similarly widespread currency example pascal fortran 
differing dialects noticeably described older newer standard remained proprietary extensions languages 
significant extensions far near pointer qualifications intended deal peculiarities intel processors 
originally designed portability prime goal succeeded expressing programs including operating systems machines ranging smallest personal computers supercomputers 
flawed enormous success 
accidents history surely helped evidently satisfied need system implementation language efficient displace assembly language sufficiently fluent describe algorithms interactions wide variety environments
