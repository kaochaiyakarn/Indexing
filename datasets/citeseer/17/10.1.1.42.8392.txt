main objective survey basic concepts computer science representation knowledge summarize advantages drawbacks 
secondary objective relate techniques information sciences theory practice 
survey classifies concepts knowledge representation broad ontological categories 
static ontology describes static aspects world things exist attributes relationships 
dynamic ontology hand describes changing aspects world terms states state transitions processes 
intentional ontology encompasses world things agents believe want prove disprove argue 
social ontology covers social settings agents positions roles authority permanent organizational structures shifting networks alliances interdependencies 
knowledge management concerned representation organization acquisition creation usage evolution knowledge forms 
build effective technologies knowledge management need understanding individuals groups organizations knowledge 
knowledge encoded computer readable forms need build tools effectively search databases files web sites extract information capture meaning organize available 
focuses concepts computer information systems exploit meaning information 
information science exists today provides important foundations supporting knowledge management 
documentation tradition long history developing methods practices organizing vast human knowledge access various kinds users 
computational side information science developed powerful techniques retrieving documents different forms computer processing search 
information science building technologies information systems manage vast amounts information initially catalogues bibliographic information full text documents networked multimedia information bases 
significant challenges remain 
information science field historically focused document primary unit information 
documents traditionally consisted primarily published books articles 
contents individually meaningful literal surface level 
deeper meanings require interpretation relation connected documents cultural contexts 
connections relatively sparse dozen academic article little built semantics simply leads document untyped hypertext links predominate today world wide web 
documents fairly stable new ones take considerable time effort create 
document content primarily read interpreted acted humans 
electronic digital media changed 
documents arbitrarily large composites volumes libraries material 
importantly arbitrarily small paragraphs text fragments pieces data video audio clips documents commonsense usage term logically identifiable packages information 
change granularity information units increases number units needs managed orders magnitude 
just consider number email messages sent day number post notes written 
tend densely connected referring multiple ways 
change rapidly 
data constantly updated documents created revised post notes detached re attached different context discarded analogous electronic cut paste 
documents active embedded software code applets software agents exhibit dynamic self activating behavior 
today knowledge relies heavily electronic media 
move knowledge management accelerates need information science deal new demanding notion document 
contrast field information systems historically started spectrum 
information comes small chunks bank account balances ticket reservations information change quickly frequently management dynamic information fundamental information systems 
information items usually need interpreted relation items london ticket quite meaningless know departure destination city date airline passenger relationships need formally defined network connected information navigated operated automated procedures order produce ticket seconds 
information processing electronic speeds commonplace people come expect equally powerful technologies managing complex knowledge structures 
case information science foundations laid information systems area managing knowledge considerable challenges 
central issue lies meaning exploited information systems produce computational results 
exploiting meaning information systems interestingly field computing science fact gradual movement call knowledge orientation 
place past years long term concept knowledge management fashionable 
consensus notion knowledge knowledge processing computing science terms usually data data processing highlight needs clarify relationship symbols stored computers represent world outside manipulation symbolic representations internal computer processing explicitly formally deal semantics representations manipulations effective meta descriptions operating symbols structures 
assortment techniques representing managing codified knowledge emerged number areas computer science notably artificial intelligence databases software engineering information systems 
movement knowledge orientation organized coherent movement viewed come variety reasons 
practical standpoint growing complexity application domains software development increasing intertwining machine human processes contributed recognition needs development techniques address 
movement motivated search foundations various computing disciplines bubenko newell ullman 
artificial intelligence area developed techniques representing knowledge forms exploited computational procedures heuristics 
database management systems research produced techniques support representation management large amounts relatively simple knowledge 
underlying vehicles include relational databases related technologies 
software engineering developed elaborate techniques capturing knowledge relates requirements design decisions rationale software system 
information systems area benefited directly indirectly developments 
computer information systems meaning information usually captured terms conceptual information models offer semantic terms modeling applications structuring information mylopoulos 
models build primitive concepts entity activity agent goal 
addition models support mechanisms organizing information generic abstraction dimensions generalization aggregation classification mylopoulos yu 
defining terms mechanisms information modeling organization conceptual models requires assumptions applications modeled 
example assume applications consist interrelated entities sense build terms entity relationship conceptual model allow computation semantics terms support navigation search retrieval update inference semantics relationships 
identification right concepts modeling world computations knowledge management operations come known ontology computer science 
ontologies ontology branch philosophy concerned study exists 
formal ontologies proposed th century including ones carnap bunge 
computational perspective major benefit formalizations development algorithms support generation inferences set facts world ones check consistency 
computational aids clearly useful knowledge management especially dealing large amounts knowledge 
various methods devised support knowledge organization interchange 
controlled vocabularies provide standardized dictionary terms example indexing retrieval 
dictionaries organized specific relations form taxonomies 
ontologies specify semantics domain terms conceptual relationships logical theories 
example interested health care related knowledge patient disease symptom diagnosis treatment primitive concepts want describe domain 
concepts meanings define ontology health care 
ontology common knowledge facilitates communication health workers 
development hospital information systems decision support systems 
earlier computational ontologies includes cyc project lenat guha arpa knowledge sharing effort neches 
knowledge interchange format effort provides declarative language describing knowledge genesereth 
national library medicine assembled large multidisciplinary multi site team unified medical language system aimed reducing fundamental barriers application computers medicine 
similarly ontology manufacturing may consist industrial process resource schedule product 
ontologies may constructed different purposes example enable information sharing support specification 
want enable sharing reuse define ontology specification making ontological commitments gruber 
ontological commitment agreement consistently vocabulary respect theory specified ontology 
order support specification define ontology conceptualization ontology defines entities relationships 
information base implicit explicit conceptualization 
research artificial intelligence formalized interesting ontologies developed techniques analyzing knowledge represented terms 
different path wand studied adequacy information systems describe applications general ontology proposed bunge 
characterize classify current ontologies propose broad ontological categories respectively deal static dynamic intentional social aspects world 
claim large class applications representation relevant knowledge primitive concepts ontological categories 
static ontology describes things exist attributes relationships 
dynamic ontology describes world terms states state transitions processes 
intentional ontology encompasses world agents things agents believe want prove disprove argue 
social ontology covers social settings permanent organizational structures shifting networks alliances interdependencies 
static ontology static ontology describes static aspects world things exist attributes relationships 
knowledge representation frameworks assume world populated entities endowed unique immutable identity lifetime set attributes relationships entities 
basic ontology may means universal 
instance hayes offers ontology different classes applications modeling material substances entities say liter water pound sugar merged resulting different entity 
note successful models statecharts harel support ontology intended real time systems :10.1.1.20.461

certain applications useful distinguish different modes existence entities including physical existence authors existence number nonexistence characteristic santa claus john canceled trip japan impossible existence square root square circle hirst 
example partial static ontology hospital expressed kaos modeling language dardenne van lamsweerde fickas 
example entity hospital defined associated attributes admitted released registered available specialty 
attributes take values sets instances patient available takes values sets instances doctors specialty takes values sets instances subjects 
definition includes set theoretic invariant constraint states admitted subset registered instance hospital 
addition admitted released mutually exclusive sets 
define relationship class treating relates patient hospital entity classes associated cardinality constraints invariant 
invariant states patient treated hospital patient hospital patient eventually released 
example ontology reproductive medicine describe patient diagnosis treatment qualitative quantitative characteristics morphology 
morphological ontology includes shape texture 
spatial information important applications involve physical world geographic information systems gis 
spatial information modeled terms points larger units spheres cubes pyramids 
formally defined spatial ontologies allow computational reasoning operations rotation occlusion provided
