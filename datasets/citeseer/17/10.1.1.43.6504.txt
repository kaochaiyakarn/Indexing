speech recognition 
abbot abbot hybrid connectionist hmm system differs traditional hmms posterior probability phone acoustic data directly estimated frame likelihood phone state model generating data 
posterior probability estimation performed connectionist network set networks trained classify phones 
abbot system recurrent network 
direct estimation posterior probability distribution connectionist network attractive fewer parameters required connectionist model posterior distribution typically complex likelihood connectionist architectures assumptions form distribution 
additionally approach enables efficient search algorithm uses posterior pruning able provide useful acoustic confidence measures
