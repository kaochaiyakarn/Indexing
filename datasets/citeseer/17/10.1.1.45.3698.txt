basic notions statistical data modeling section analyze concepts statistician generally uses specify information interest statistical survey referring particular surveys finite populations households persons enterprises motivate need founded conceptual approach statistical surveys 
specifying information content statistical survey populations interest defined terms statistical units 
word statistical unit mean abstraction set real world objects called instances form class 
basic property statistical unit possibility enumerating instances calculating totals obtaining summary data 
example person statistical unit interested calculating summary data total wages persons professional status number persons wage categories 
populations statistical units represent kind phenomenon provided phenomenon described terms class 
instance phenomenon vacation persons described statistical unit may compute example total expenditure persons vacations number vacations vacation site 
contrary phenomenon employment considered statistical unit 
properties class represented statistical unit modeled means statistical variables

domain quantitative variable set numerical values representing result observing measurable characteristic 
worth noting domain qualitative variable may set numbers numeric code code numbers measures 
follows quantitative variables may summary variables 
summary variable sense summarize respect statistical unit 
examples summary variables expenditure vacations sex occupation examples non summary variables 
variables describe properties defined functions linking statistical units domains values 
example sex links person male female 
statistical units linked functions relations notice function variable 
instance statistical units person vacation linked relation enjoy 
statistical survey may interesting single subsets statistical units called statistical sub units 
statistical sub unit described starting statistical unit specifying condition instances satisfy order instances condition may defined statistical variables statistical units linked functions relations 
example person age obtained statistical unit person variable age 
hand person living residence built obtained statistical unit person variable statistical unit residence linked person relation live 
example household unemployed member obtained statistical unit household variable statistical unit person linked household relation 
example imposed condition household requires quantification new relation composition inverse

defining summary data statistician specifies set statistical variables usually called category variables fixing particular grouping instances sub unit 
example sex category variables 
note variables directly observed statistical unit interest chosen statistical variables

terminology summary data statistical survey specified means statistical goals 
main kinds goals may singled depending type statistical operator 
kind goals refers totals computed respect summary variables count elements statistical unit 
defined statistical units partitioned values variables 
specifying kind goals unit subunit interest called target chosen set category variables 
new object defined called aggregate corresponding collection sets instances target 
set associated element cartesian product codomains specified category variables way groups instances target observed values variables 
goal defined selecting statistical operator applied aggregate case operator summarization summary variable 
example referring statistical unit person variables sex age may compute goal total personal income sex age summary variable person partitioned values cartesian product codomains sex age 
vacation statistical unit variable expenditure may calculate goal total expenditure vacations persons sex age expenditure summary variable target vacation partitioned variables sex age linked indirectly statistical unit person enjoys 
result computations ordered set numerical values corresponding instance cartesian product codomains specified variables 
note variables define subunits category summary variables defined basis variables previous example category variables defined composition sex age respectively inverse enjoys 
worth noting goals kind may derived particular conditions partitioning variables 
example number persons sex derivable number persons sex age 
note notion derivability different definitions literature 
aim context mainly distinguish derivability definability goals notions mixed existing conceptual model 
definability goal mean information required specification goal available 
derivability problems studied literature concerned manipulations statistical tables relevant special concrete situations database managing summary data coming different sources 
contrary need reasoning definability goals arises situations statistical information collected analyzed independently represented managed 
second kind goals refers computations obtained statistical operators average percentage square mean error due semantics operators goals kind defined previously defined goals 
example starting goals total personal income sex age number persons sex age may define average personal income sex age
