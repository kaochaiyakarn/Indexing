keywords user modelling multidatabase intelligent interface traditional user modelling information retrieval filtering tasks establish description users interests supplement queries 
user models generally acquired actively asking users select terms interest passively collecting terms past queries 
information retrieval systems included ontologies domain terms include richer sets links merely synonymy support richer inferences merely adding synonyms set search terms 
modern information retrieval system mips exemplar 
motivation development systems allow users query information content location 
example querying location done database language sql information requests expressed terms columns required tables named databases equally world wide web www uses universal resource locators urls identify object location 
multiple databases available networks need multidatabase solutions allow single queries expressed terms content semantics mapped pertinent set columns tables named databases www grows need index tools map semantic content terms sets url locations met various web robot index sites altavista lycos

user modelling component design space general inference supported user models heuristic classification 
heuristics allow individual users classified domain properties inferred individual users basis classification 
support inferences rules exist associate attribute values user classes order determine classes users belong 
new information established users rules triggered user classification grow rich change class 
second set rules exist relate user classes domain classes 
general inheritance rule usually applied domain properties 
user model impoverished domain property consequences impoverished defaults applied overridden

consequently applications minimal direct questions balanced acquire essential information user user language supplemented passive user knowledge acquisition components establish increasingly rich user models progresses monitoring users interaction application 
user modelling systems usually include method classifying users groups relating groups domain concepts software user modelling component incorporated application 
user modelling components generally include component store user model interface write read store 
write interface supports acquisition user models read interface supports querying user model domain application information 
store supports heuristic classification write time read time 
inferencing performed write time performed information stored inferences normally performed parallel thread main process add massively processing delay user response time 
drawn inferences write time may inconsistent statements written consequences truth maintenance reasoning component required resolve inconsistencies 
inferences drawn read time inferences required support read operations drawn results inferences inconsistent knowledge user 
inferences read time cause main process pause read function returns delaying system response time user 
user class domain class user property domain property class rules domain generalisations class mapping rules heuristic classification inference performed user modelling components complex user modelling components developed incorporated natural language dialogue systems 
simpler user modelling components allow descriptions users preferences registered tailor user interface characteristics 
mips system mips system supports single user query retrieve information multiple information sources provides single integrated answer user 
information sources assumed heterogeneous include text retrieval systems www sites relational 
assumption databases developed distributed databases common schema units may idiosyncratic terms identify data 
information retrieved include structured numeric data strings text image sound video files requiring multimedia presentation technology

domain modelling component described necessary outline structure basis description retrieval process 
domain model represents generic concepts simple semantic network including links object subtyping instantiation component parts geographic location attribute possession value 
ontology represents high level generic concepts assumption extended particular application domain linked specialised ontology server domain 
conceptual domain model attempt capture substantial part common sense knowledge ontology available serves purpose current replaced 
similarly domain model optimised ontological generality performance efficiency explore tradeoffs qualities required maintenance effort 
distinction drawn ontology conceptual types city town airport ground data types string integer video 
semantics conceptual types defined links types inference drawn 
ground data types denote entries information sources

architecture mips system 
requirements describing information source procedure demands economically applied large number information sources 
equally information sources available may effort implement maintain common data schema users query sequence integrate results 
consequently mips approach mapping semantic queries sets locations ones integrating responses applicable information sources regularly

information retrieval mips mips implements stages information retrieval process listed drawing domain model user models support inferences 
generic retrieval process described section discuss variations results drawing user model 
example stage user asks information city called corfu represented query mips internal representation language irl quant null city attr name corfu 
stating city name city corfu 
normal way asking question query languages null quantify particular variable possible values instantiated evaluated truth variables existentially quantified 
query asks information city called corfu 
query city conceptual type name shortcut expressing ground type string holds name conceptual type 
query asking names cities list strings returned database asking conceptual type represented databases retrieved 
step brought application conceptual querying heuristic 
conceptual type queried interpreted directly expanded attributes queried 
rules repeated recursively child attribute conceptual ground type turn expanded 
application rule large number ground types queried linked back original conceptual types chains links includes image map video text descriptions 
heuristic maximises number items located cost retrieval time access cost usability answer 
output stage largest possible list ground types inferred queried conceptual types users request 
second step draws descriptions available external information sources stored kbs 
relational database attributes tables described terms domain ontology 
free text retrieval systems www urls domain ontology terms describe areas information available source 
descriptions information sources matched expanded query produced processing stage 
ground variable expanded query produce results match operation firstly direct match information sources secondly matches information source thirdly matches information sources result inferences relate ground variable query information source description 
general inference matches apply subtype query heuristic example conceptual subtype inference accept database dogs user asked animals geographic part subtype search database athens user asked greece 
inferences directly supported links domain model information source description contains subtype variable queried user request add information source list candidates variable 
result second stage subset expanded query ground types match available information sources corresponding information source location details 
level query produced user interface location content querying 
request contains maximum amount location queries derived original content query 
third stage retrieval process reduce set applying constraints retrieval process 
filtering step removes known redundancy removing information occurs sub query retrieve data item retrieved data source 
rules applied reduce number candidate information sources constraints retrieval process 
constraints drawn user model described section
