recognition performance state art systems currently high large vocabulary connected word tasks shown recognizer performance degrades significantly non fluent speakers 
systems designed specifically non native speakers language tutoring systems able constrain recognition component way bring recognition accuracy acceptable level diminishing effectiveness application 
multi lingual systems new languages quickly added little training data answer difficult questions map existing knowledge speech unseen languages take advantage regularities native speech

examine non native speech differs native speech ask effects idiosyncrasies nonnative speech recognition 
native speakers vary tremendously language similarities native speakers systematic captured statistically derived acoustic language models particularly speech constrained way speaker style domain 
individual idiosyncrasies preferences notwithstanding native speakers command language guides speak certain flow order convey meaning 
pauses disfluencies occur natural speech merely speech errors play important role discourse allowing processing time speaker listener marking new difficult information

speakers fluent language speaking face obstacles language production native speakers 
may difficulty articulating certain phonemes producing appropriate context 
may know right words mastered right syntax express want say may know things need time formulate meaningful sentences
