interesting questions mean apply function value outside domain

alternatively specify explicit value arguments outside domain approach exploited choosing particularly convenient 
example decide lots nice unconditional theorems xy

arbitrary value chosen freak theorems show occasionally 
define normally xy real number multiplying zero gives zero 
untyped system problem happens example wouldn know disappear completely 
serious disadvantage scheme 
constructive systems membership domain may undecidable solution simply isn available

differentiation operator total yield value regardless function differentiable relevant point 
accidentally happen equation true function weren differentiable 
equation contains information intuitively expect

surprising equality considered basic thing hard avoid sees phrases unique value write
