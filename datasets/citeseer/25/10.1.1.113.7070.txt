ikewiki developed primarily tool ontology engineering variety application scenarios 
briefly article 
serious obstacle development semantic web applications lack formal ontologies knowledge represented formal languages 
arguably main reasons high technical barrier semantic web technologies domain experts formalising knowledge 
formalised knowledge currently limited computer science small number areas high demand interoperability genetic engineering 
time wiki systems popular tools content knowledge management 
knowledge nowadays available systems wikipedia 
unfortunately vast knowledge accessible machines 
small amount knowledge formalised wiki systems provide improved interfaces advanced searching navigation facilities 
semantic wiki systems aim combine traditional wiki systems semantic web technology 
combination bears potential application areas 
article prototype system ikewiki ike knowledge wiki fast feature rich semantic wiki system developed salzburg research 
ikewiki serves testbed possible applications semantic wiki technology 
briefly outline applications collaborative ontology engineering collaborative knowledge management educational environments 
article structured follows section summarises important features traditional wiki systems section introduces semantic wikis describes features common section briefly describes design architecture ikewiki section presents application scenarios section gives overview related section concludes perspectives 
traditional wiki systems wiki short form derived hawaiian expression wiki wiki meaning fast quick 
wiki essentially collection web sites connected hyperlinks 
wide range wiki systems available mediawiki different purposes audiences share common properties editing browser 
content usually edited simple browser interface installing additional expensive software 
editing simple allows modify pages world minimal technical requirements 
consequence content creators access update wiki home conferences nowadays travelling 
simplified wiki syntax 
content usually expressed simplified hypertext format wiki syntax easier non technical users html 
formatting require knowledge html 
www mediawiki org de org rollback mechanism 
changes content wiki versioned time stored previous versions pages kept 
allows revert back earlier versions page case important parts accidentally deleted undesirable modifications 
wiki systems allow compare versions page making possible identify changes edits quickly 
unrestricted access 
wiki systems access completely unrestricted correct modify complete delete 
strange dangerous traditional perspective practice shows system works hand users rare hand changes easily undone rollback mechanism 
note wikis allow apply access restrictions users groups traditional content management systems 
collaborative editing 
mentioned properties combined wikis ideal tool collaborative editing 
soon creates content contribute extend correct wiki systems provide support collaborative editing means discussion forums summaries changes list updates 
strong linking 
pages wiki usually strongly linked hyperlinks 
reason simplified wiki syntax easy define link page wiki 
example wikis link defined enclosing word square brackets called word contains upper case letters 
links non existing pages usually rendered different colour 
user clicks link system redirects view create non existing page 
wikis way create page 
links wiki important tool navigation 
systems allow follow links direction defined reverse direction back links 
search function 
tool navigation wiki systems allow full text search content pages 
uploading content 
addition creating text content sophisticated wikis allow uploading arbitrary multimedia content documents images program code groupware content knowledge management tools wiki system gives users complete freedom content development process rigid workflow access restrictions predefined structures 
users need adapt practice dictate system allow practice define structure 
important different domains require different kinds workflow 
survey popular technology site slashdot showed wiki systems currently wide variety purposes including encyclopaedia systems collect knowledge certain area unrestricted wikipedia community effort contributions wide range users software development collaboratively create documentation collect ideas track bugs today high profile open source projects apache mozilla wikis coordination project knowledge management project tracking brainstorming exchange ideas coordination activities agenda tool collecting topics meetings project notes repository knowledge base staff directory personal knowledge management sketchpad collect elaborate personal ideas addresses dates tasks bookmarks collaborative writing authors collectively writing short story novel immediately accessible readers enjoyment cms knowledge base collect content connect content simple publication tool semantic wiki systems semantic wiki extends wiki semantic technologies rdf owl topic map conceptual graphs :10.1.1.60.6095
main idea inherent structure wiki strong linking pages accessible machines agents services mere navigation 
generally done annotating existing navigational links symbols describe meaning 
example link mozart salzburg annotated lived born 
ask slashdot org article pl sid org en main page www wikipedia org annotations useful purposes enhanced presentation displaying contextual information enhanced navigation giving easy access relevant related information enhanced semantic search respects context addition content 
note presentation navigation search done generic manner profit greatly adaptation represented context 
semantic wikis exist different flavours se mediawiki ikewiki :10.1.1.59.6920:10.1.1.60.6095
page content foreground annotations just optional added value require annotations extent annotation important page content 
reflects different systems different purposes extending existing content annotations allow better navigation collaborative ontology engineering frequently features typing annotating links 
virtually semantic wikis allow annotate links giving certain types 
idea link created user carries meaning mere navigation example section 
way link annotations edited differs system system 
semantic wikis include annotations part wiki syntax semantic mediawiki provide separate editor adding annotations ikewiki :10.1.1.59.6920
context aware presentation 
semantic wikis change way content semantic annotations 
include enriching pages displaying semantically related pages separate link box displaying information derived underlying knowledge base box graphical tree presentation content belonging hierarchy license information rendering content page different manner suitable context multimedia content vs text content 
enhanced navigation 
annotated typed links provide information navigation 
traditional wiki allows follow link semantic wiki offers additional information relation link describes 
information offer additional sophisticated navigation 
instance links independent textual context appear displayed separate related information box 
page describing mozart offer separate box categorised lived composed semantic search 
semantic wikis allow semantic search underlying knowledge base 
usually queries expressed language sparql query language proposed recommendation rdf querying 
semantic search users ask queries retrieve pieces composed mozart retrieve documents license permits derivative works 
reasoning support 
reasoning means deriving additional implicit knowledge facts entered system predefined user defined rules knowledge base 
example fact mozart composed die te system capable reasoning deduce mozart composer 
reasoning important feature supported small number wikis 
reasons time consuming memory intensive yield results expected traceable user 
ikewiki number semantic wiki systems currently development 
introduce system called ikewiki 
wiki name derived hawaiian translated fast knowledge 
design principles considered different settings ikewiki originally developed prototype tool support knowledge workers collaboratively formalising knowledge 
ikewiki design principles influenced idea equally hold areas easy interactive interface 
domain experts usually non technical people ease big importance 
interface resembles closely possible wikipedia interface people familiar 
ikewiki offers interactive editor ajax technology communicate server backend addition traditional structured text editor wysiwyg editors generally better acceptance non technical users 
editor supports interactive typing links resources 
time ikewiki offers normal editing interfaces supporting wikipedia style structured text experienced users 
compatibility wikipedia mediawiki 
significant amount informal knowledge available wikipedia 
reuse knowledge ikewiki supports wiki org index php semantic wiki state art wikipedia syntax 
allows users import existing content wikipedia ikewiki simple copy paste semantic annotations straight away 
compatibility semantic web standards 
able exchange data applications ontology editors semantic web services wikis ikewiki purely existing semantic web standards rdf owl 
note knowledge representation formats conceptual graphs conceivable investigated point 
immediate exploitation semantic annotations 
important motivating aspect wiki systems content immediately available public user clicks save 
similarly ikewiki allows immediate exploitation semantic annotations enhanced editing presentation navigation searching knowledge base fully formalised 
support different levels experience 
ikewiki designed tool collaborative knowledge engineering 
process common non technical domain experts experienced knowledge engineers 
ikewiki supports levels experience 
means certain advanced functionalities hidden novice users available experienced users 
support different levels formalisation 
different application areas need different levels formalisation jim hendler said little semantics goes long way 
goals ikewiki support formalisation knowledge way informal texts formal ontologies 
means parts knowledge base formalised formal knowledge constant evolution 
support reasoning 
semantic wikis ikewiki supports reasoning knowledge base 
consider reasoning important allows derive knowledge explicit data true power semantic web technology
