privacy issues raised rfid tags seen attention popular press negative coverage forced clothing retailer withdraw plans embedding rfid tags items apparel 
researchers recognized rfid privacy problem time continuing devise better approaches 
single approach completely satisfactory combination methods may prove best 
introduces new powerful tool arsenal privacy protecting technologies related rfid tags 
subsections discuss previously suggested approaches protecting consumer privacy threatened rfid tags 
move approach 
kill tag approach straightforward approach protection consumer privacy kill rfid tags placed hands consumers 
killed tag truly dead re activated 
standard mode operation proposed center tags killed purchase tagged product 
proposed tag design tag killed sending special kill command including short bit password :10.1.1.12.4948
example supermarket rfid tags facilitate inventory management monitoring shelf stocks 
protect consumer privacy checkout clerks kill tags purchased goods purchased goods contain active rfid tags 
kill approach inadequate 
environments simple measures kill commands unworkable undesirable privacy enforcement 
example consumers may wish rfid tags remain operative possession 
examples home set forth microwave oven reads cooking instructions food packages rely actively operational tags 
similarly new clever consumer specific applications rfid tags emerge 
example prada store new york city tracks rfid tags items held customers order display related accessories nearby screens 
examples rfid tag applications ordinary consumers include effortless physical access control theft protection wireless cash cards 
low cost powerful technology rfid tags inevitably numerous applications don imagine today 
applications require tags active consumer possession killed purchase 
suggestive applications stores may wish products tags products returned defective 
products may need scanned may categorized recycling purposes 
stores may issue receipts embedded rfid tags confirm purchase details product returned 
individuals may wish rfid tags embedded business cards facilitate scanning recipients 
tag id may create url referring actual card data 
store may wish embed rfid tags store issued coupons ease scanning checkout counter 
user may wish scan possessions recall specific set products issued 
baseball cards cds may rfid tags enable owners manage inventory better 
smartcards rfid enabled chips fact purpose today generally function close proximity readers 
merchant may wish scan consumers marketing purposes 
example stores shopper previously visited today 
items bought previously competitor 
refrigerator shelf may able tell food drug product passed expiration date 
postal service may include rfid tags 
airline ticket may contain embedded rfid tag allow simpler tracking passengers airport 
businesses may include rfid tags invoices coupons return envelopes mail consumers ease sorting return 
function creep promises result uses today active tags valuable consumers businesses 
additional example may possible consumers buy little embedded rfid tags attach objects choice idiosyncratic purposes 
treasure hunt assisting blind person baggage labeling 
individuals may secretly tags tracked identified merchant private detective spouse parent relative 
kill tag purchase approach may handle instances potential concern privacy fully satisfactory solution 
imperative explore alternative approaches 
cage approach rfid tag may shielded scrutiny known cage container metal mesh foil impenetrable radio signals certain frequencies 
petty thieves known foil lined bags retail shops circumvent detection mechanisms 
high value currency notes come supplied active rfid tags foil lined wallets big sellers 
offers cage product privacy purposes 
rfid tags inevitably see vast range objects placed conveniently containers clothing wrist watches human beings 
cages represent best partial solution consumer privacy

consumer carry device actively broadcasts radio signals block disrupt operation nearby rfid readers 
approach may illegal broadcast power high crude approach 
cause severe disruption nearby rfid systems legitimate applications privacy concern 
approach propose akin jamming subtle operation interacting cleverly rfid protocol disrupt certain operations 
smart rfid tag approach general approach rfid tags bit smarter interact way protects privacy better providing desired active functionality 
typically involve cryptographic methods 
approaches exceptionally challenging design severe cost constraints basic rfid tag 
budget cents little spend additional logic gates 
instances smart rfid tag approach proposed hash lock method re encryption method forms silent tree walking 
hash lock approach 
approach due weis tag may locked refuses reveal id unlocked simplest scenario tag locked value meta id unlocked presentation key pin value standard way hash function supermarket example tags may locked check time :10.1.1.100.5811
consumer provide meta id tags loyalty card transmit unlocking pin special device requiring physical contact unlock tags returning home 
approach workable may necessary reader query tag find meta id reader knows pin unlock 
may allow tracking tags meta ids defeating purpose 
weis show randomization hash function computation solve problem 
effective approach consumers find inconvenient manage lock unlock patterns associated pins small collection tags 
addition possible consumers may aware objects possession carry rfid tags 
re encryption approach 
juels address privacy implications rfid tags embedded scheme tag serial numbers encrypted law enforcement public key 
resulting ciphertexts undergo periodic re encryption reduce different appearances tag 
severely restricted computing resources rfid tags propose re encryption performed external computing agents publicly provided stations stores 
correct behavior re encryption agents may verified handled stores banks 
main drawback approach resource intensive nature 
rfid tags scheme perform cryptographic operation unrealistically costly required infrastructure re encryption agents optical verifiers probably burdensome 
describe similar scheme suitable privacy protection rfid tags embedded consumer goods 
multiple public keys technique call universal re encryption extension el gamal cryptosystem possible re encrypt ciphertext knowing associated public key 
scheme suffers drawback juels requirement infrastructure re encryption devices

weis correctly note threat posed passive eavesdroppers ability hear signals broadcast tag reader may picked hundreds meters away ability hear signals rfid tag picked nearby :10.1.1.100.5811
unfortunate ids read standard tree walking protocol inferred hearing merely signals broadcast reader
