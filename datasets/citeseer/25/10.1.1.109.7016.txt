word semantic similarity number approaches measuring conceptual similarity words taken past 
tversky feature similarity model arguably powerful similarity model date 
applicability ir situation require richer knowledge base available 
wordnet derived knowledge base quite thorough coverage concepts number semantic relation types connecting concepts considerably required feature similarity model 
experimented alternative approaches estimating semantic similarity refer information conceptual distance approaches 
information similarity estimator information approach measuring semantic similarity carried resnick 
resnick views noun synsets class words class words synset words directly indirectly subordinate synsets 
conceptual similarity considered terms class similarity 
similarity classes approximated information content class noun hierarchy subsumes classes 
information content class approximated estimating probability occurrence class large text corpus see appendix discussion class probabilities 
similarity classes expressed sim max log ci ci ci set classes dominating ci class probability class ci log information content class ci 
ci methodology probably best illustrated example assume wish discover similarities classes car bicycle banana fork 
sim car bicycle see wordnet classes car bicycle subordinate concept graphs reported rada kim lee contain links whilst concepts ginsberg system related broader term narrower term links 
intended extend wordnet include relation types form attribute function connect wordnet adjective verb collections noun collection 
developments considerably enhance wordnet applicability feature similarity models 
case occurrence classes computed collection noun occurrences text wall street journal replicates examples version wordnet synset info content vehicle instrumentality artifact object entity takes similarity measure maximum information content value set classes subsume synsets sim car bicycle 
notice expected classes grow frequent informative moves higher hierarchy 
car bicycle specific informative classes common conclude similar 
contrast examples yield sim car fork sim car banana instrumentality object artifact entity object entity see cars forks quite bit similar cars bicycles similar cars bananas 
explained fact forks cars objects people artifacts said terms similarity cars bananas things object 
conceptual distance estimator conceptual distance approach estimating semantic similarity words derived carried rada 
essence similarity concepts estimated sum edge weights shortest path connecting corresponding synsets kb 
extends rada definition semantic similarity including paths meronym link types 
estimator semantic similarity assumes edges synsets kb weighted relational links wordnet unweighted 
concept graphs rada kim lee created domain independent kb large containing order tens thousands nodes 
reason usual process hand weighting link viable method automatically weighting link developed 
initial research area node metrics hierarchical hypertexts research subsequently considerably influenced sussna 
certain observations regard conceptual distance aid process automatically determining weight edges 
instance value weight link affected density hcg point depth hcg strength connotation parent child nodes 
regard width different parts hcg denser 
instance plant section kb dense individual nodes having children collection generally plant species 
arguably held distance nodes section concept graph small relative dense regions 
terms depth said distance shrinks descends hcg 
explain suppose sibling relations near top hierarchy deep detailed portion hcg 
illustrate suppose node living thing high hierarchy children nodes plant animal 
siblings far apart conceptually compared siblings parent deep hcg 
illustrates point regarding local strength connotation 
life form animal person plant kb extract argued parent node life form strongly child nodes animal plant person nodes 
density hcg specific link type estimated counting number links type 
strength connotation link weighted estimated function information content value sibling parent node numbers nodes information content values 
result operations normalised dividing depth link hcg 
approaches semantic similarity estimators semantic similarity quite different approaches inherent strengths weaknesses 
rada shown experiments conceptual distance weighted hcg simulates surprising accuracy humans assessment conceptual closeness documents queries 
informal experimentation conceptual distance measure general concerns regard measure estimator semantic similarity 
due comparatively broad domain compared rada worked solely medical domain conceptual distance measures accurate expected 
situation improved large degree decided include non hierarchical link types distance calculation 
conceptual distance measure particularly susceptible vagaries builders wordnet 
particular organisation concepts wordnet puzzling 
irregular densities links concepts results unexpected conceptual distance measures 
typically result expected links concepts 
due general operation conceptual distance similarity estimator concepts middle high sections geographically close deemed conceptually similar 
depth scaling factor link weighting mechanism effect cases general structure wordnet derived overcome link weighting causing serious side effects hcg 
information measure similarity dependent existence organisation kb links conceptual distance measure 
certain amount contextual information captured text corpus calculate information content values combined extensive coverage concepts kb provides powerful measure semantic similarity 
measure dependent organisation concepts hierarchy broad coverage concepts wordnet difficult critical hierarchical structure concepts 
authenticity synset information content value obviously dependent size domain independence text corpus 
case noun occurrences newspaper articles reasonable attempt calculating information content values 
despite apparent strengths information similarity measure weaknesses 
foremost fact ignores information kb may useful 
synonym relations relation types effectively conceptual distance approach overlooked 
second weakness apparent method calculating information content classes 
polysemous words multi synsets exaggerated information content value 
takes instance word bank information content word include occurrences bank corpus regardless word sense 
gives exaggerated information content value commercial bank river bank 
due fact information content values calculated synsets opposed individual words possible information content value exaggerated situations synsets number commonly occurring ambiguous words 
example synset yield fruit information content value synset calculated frequencies word fruit word yield 
fact information content class defined terms information contents subordinate classes super classes classes containing polysemous words similarly valued 
disregard ambiguous words problem fact synsets wordnet derived kb refer particular senses words kb tends include fine sense distinctions attempt exhaustive coverage concept meanings 
final caveat apparent information approach semantic similarity fact different concepts similar concept 
effect clearly seen example apple produce green goods fruit berry banana kb extract showing violation minimality information similarity estimator see information estimate similarity apple banana closer estimated similarity produce green goods 
clear violation minimality property metric 
violations minimality metric properties undesirable simplified model world bad effect system performance 
despite differences obvious way combining similarity estimators take advantages aspects approach compensate individual weaknesses 
consequently performed sets ir experiments conceptual distance similarity estimator information 
objective just determine better measure discover approach suited certain situations vice versa
