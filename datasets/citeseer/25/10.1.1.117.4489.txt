discuss prefer traditional roc curve offer examples speaker recognition language recognition 
explain produce approximately linear curves 
note special points may included curves multiple targets possible applications 
detection tasks viewed involving tradeoff error types missed detections false alarms 
example speech processing task recognize person speaking recognize language spoken 
recognition system may fail detect target speaker language known system may declare detection target 
tradeoff error types single performance number inadequate represent capabilities system 
system operating points best represented performance curve 
roc curve traditionally purpose 
roc taken denote receiver operating characteristic alternatively relative operating characteristic 
generally false alarm rate plotted horizontal axis correct detection rate plotted vertical 
useful speech applications variant call det detection error tradeoff curve described 
det curve plot error rates axes giving uniform treatment types error scale axes spreads plot better distinguishes different performing systems usually produces plots close linear 
gives example det curves contrasts traditional roc type curves data 
note near linearity curves det plot better spread permitting easy observation system contrasts

general evaluation protocol evaluations speech processing systems comparable fundamental detection tasks 
participants set known targets speakers languages systems trained models set unknown speech segments 
evaluation speech processing system determine unknown segment known targets 
system output likelihood segment instance target 
scale likelihood arbitrary consistent decisions larger values indicating greater likelihood target 
likelihoods generate performance curve displaying range possible operating characteristics

note normal deviate scale moves curves away lower left performance high making comparisons easier 
see typically resulting curves approximately straight lines corresponding normal likelihood distributions wide portion range

error type weighting evaluations speech processing systems provide hard decision likelihood score decision 
operating points hard decisions may indicated curves 
designated figures 
proximity points weighted average points described indication appropriately system implementers chose hard decision operating points optimize chosen cost function 
averaging targets det curves involved multiple targets required systems provide likelihood scores scale targets 
applications requiring common scale may considered undesirable 
furthermore targets occur equal frequency arguable combining data multiple targets may misleading indication performance 
alternative generate separate curves target generate average curve targets 
non targets target ordinate values may averaged abscissa value 
situation hold target example serves non target example targets 
case interpolation may obtain common set abscissa values individual target curves may averaged 
prefer combine data multiple targets directly 
requires systems develop common likelihood scale targets believe desirable applications 
believe large number targets roughly equal occurrences targets performance effectively represented
