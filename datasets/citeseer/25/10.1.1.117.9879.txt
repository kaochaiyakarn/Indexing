developing systems intended people varied contexts private social leisure activities focus design suitability designed artifact support complement human activity 
developing technology serves needs people vice versa requires revised conception computer system design allows systems engineered easily maintained reliable efficient performance brings needs people context usage sharply focus design process

adept advanced design environment prototyping task models project developed approach design includes analysis modelling users tasks modelling generation refinement interactive system designs user task models 
adept design environment provides coherent approach design focuses design tasks activities users fitting users tasks design 
research differs developing advanced user interface design environments example see adept approach focuses user tasks starting point design 
consequently designer forced recognise design artifact entails design user tasks 
previous papers described tools models adept 
rest describes generalised view user task centred design philosophy identifies models tools adept fit view 
provides useful way identifying strengths weaknesses adept 
user task design philosophy approach design puts people human activity fore development deployment technology provide framework design give rise processes tools support design approach 
presents conceptual framework approach design 
instance relates people tasks organisations artifacts providing basis design process relations 
generalised view leads development techniques allow information arising users tasks organisations design 
people individuals groups tasks social leisure activities organisations provide input formulating needs satisfied design 
results development termed designed task 
designed task expression artifact allow particular groups known organisations able carry tasks prior commitment form technology detailed design artifact 
leads design artifact collection artifacts enable designed tasks performed 
artifact model description form artifact commitment concrete implementation detail 
artifact model refined concrete artifact model design implementable form allows alternative platform specific versions artifact created physical conceptual form 
development design artifact framework provides re expression task model expected result detailing artifact 
consequently design times expressed terms users tasks organisations needs expected serve 
task evolution resultant task description design task analysis user group analyses extant task description designed task description consequences design application design rules artifact model design commitment concrete artifact model artifact user group descriptions interpretation framework user task design 
application design rules support framework design philosophy requires techniques allow users tasks organisations designers participate jointly development artifact 
caused techniques experimental psychology anthropology include role playing observations direct participation interviews card sorting protocol analysis 
similarly philosophy requires designers ensure people organisations directly understand artifacts resulting design 
consequently facilitating communication users designers direct requirement method tools developed support design philosophy 
concern evolutionary nature design 
explicit recognition users tasks organisations strong determinants design artifact artifact bring changes needs people organisations give rise new tasks 
represented framework connections artifacts various stages design resultant extant expressions task consequences artifact 
final feature framework required design philosophy need development principles forms design knowledge support transitions needs characteristics users tasks organisations properties functions artifacts 
summary design philosophy assumes user interface design comes having increased involvement communication participation design designers users organizations increased involvement communication come greater understanding users tasks organisations consequences usage artifacts design include focus tasks activities users organisations possible ignore away detail implementation issues force design design process requires iteration development models including users organisations tasks artifacts final assumption design requires development principled design knowledge support transition user organisation task characteristics hand artifact properties functions
