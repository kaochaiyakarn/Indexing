goal project user interface effectively workers exploring analyzing collaboratively authoring shared graph knowledge 
domain independent way tool new fields programming 
web documents vs graph things semantic web primarily users read aggregated information graph ignoring fact data may assimilated sources possibly inference 
original tabulator experience demonstrated readers able determine source documents understand provenance data term document source may sort thing referred store may accessed sparql simple dereferencing social aspects information apply case

just trust document web domain name web site trust statement graph uri metadata document 
levels breaks consistency user interface possible single homogeneous level 
level breaking necessary errors understandable 
just web error occurs web browser user checks uri may check network connectivity host reader graph level able understand document network operation produced error 
strength web browsers compared distributed systems built familiar components allow user understand nature network errors 
assumed editor graph allow users understand nature errors document level 
able distinguish example data missing file files syntax errors network errors prevent reading

writing editing process considering editing writing rdf data people social concerns complimentary reading data 
concerns include sure data stored persistently able read allowed re terms 
example entering certain information aware part personal address book public resource 
challenge editing application ensure questions answerable distracting main purpose editing existing creating new data 
graph person may wish edit changing existing adding new data effectively aggregation graphs different sources simple design semantic web editor allow user edit graph time 
obviate need connections graphs documents 
single graph editors exist including 
considered ways apply working model

modes evidently useful considered feel meet goal allowing user operate level giant global graph 
single graph solution allows granularity necessary social questions understanding provenance controlling destiny data scale web able buy rent borrow storage space kinds arrangements open market

network protocol writing driving design network update protocol desire create web editable resources allow user naturally interact data

server may advertise document editable sending header document fetched 
noticed servers supporting webdav authoring send non standard header ms author webdav 
feeling big pile better little ones adapted send ms author sparql indicate server supports incremental update sparql 
systems put method amaya webdav protocol communicate uri document read 
systems typical editing session involves line editing followed explicit save user action

offline sync systems imap clearly advantages disconnected decided update extension proposed sparql update standardized derive comfort fact successfully intersection current proposals 
implement real time online system small change granularity 
user immersed community knowledge ideally allowed directly update collaborator screens immediate update step goal 
tabulator collaborative editing protocol server side document store potentially shared clients strategy optimistic concurrency 
edited field loses user focus changed deemed tabulator uses uri appropriate destination document edited described 
assembles update message send document server

collaborative environment error user level concurrency error incompatible changes client document 
network errors server unavailability may explained user 
update message field performed asynchronously user free perform editing possibly modifications pending server acknowledgment 
protocol builds sparql arbitrary design decisions possible 
hoped resulting protocol largely gain wide adoption 
convention treating document web server sparql endpoint typical sparql endpoint access large store possibly containing individual graphs different files 
design quite consistent sparql semantics 
extensions update insert delete take syntactic form existing construct production particularly novel 
update protocol design inherits useful functionalities implemented client browser 
document permissions implemented access limited specifically uri web standard authentication mechanisms 
perfect nice response distinguished empty document non existent way saying error merely advisory write operation 
obvious user jump create new file just confirm intentions specifically ask create new file uri 
put course creating new file server currently support 
approach extended collaborative system concurrent editing results clash response form server peer peer system series patches clients cause roll back state consistent server 
roll back implemented principle patch distribution protocol 
current implementation stated explore social assumptions wiki graph level set sandbox create new data deploying data wiki 
rdf data file uploaded wiki course losing comment 
system designed integrate smoothly web server 
data stored rdf files 
setting read write access arbitrary file complicated 

client side implemented asynchronous javascript environment extension 
local provenance aware triple store rdf data seen session 
change editor uses sparql update client implementation hold data document file file system represented data wiki 
update request posted respective document uri server trivially locates destination update request parses attempts apply update 
dig rdf wiki runs apache php parses update payload 
instantiates rdf store reads file contents applies update writes file back generate document revised edition 

challenges progress enabling real time editing semantic web resources number challenges remain part agenda tabulator described 
browser integration 
integration tabulator data browser editor browser posed technical difficulties due assumptions design 
browser assumes document displayed window 
matter security sure uri bar matches page shown 
user interface guarantee sense uris user interested things graph items web 
tensions user interfaces graph web level 
updating information 
ways existing implementation needs rounding simply power conventional application handling datatypes explicit implicit implementation offline working mode update webdav need source editable rdf isps support sparql 
table view facilities typical spreadsheet 
views allow update map view time line view example allow dragging objects coordinates editable 

collaboration 
improving collaborative aspects system involve subscription clients streams changes sources currently affect display seen user 
peer peer distribution differences editing data local network neighbors common server possibility

number predicates cut order form tabulator pane created new object mimic typical applications easily 
obviously provision forms languages allow tailored user input experience wanted project push boundaries built ontologies forms emphasize application domain boundaries wished dissolve
