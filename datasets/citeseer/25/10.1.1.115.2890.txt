variable demand pricing price schemes agents may set prices providing services 
conventional economies market incentives intended dynamically provision variable demand services provided different nodes 
crowcroft propose scheme provide incentives nodes forward packets nodes mobile ad hoc networks 
system goal form necessary network infrastructure transmission energy routing minimized 
node internal resources battery power capacity cost 
nodes experience variable demand routing depending location set prices internal cost 
applications variable demand inappropriate 
dhts assign nodes data pseudo random identifiers requests node evenly distributed 
variable pricing nodes attempting minimise cost take direct paths part keyspace contrary systems aims 
fair exchange nodes associate cost internal resources expend carrying service rational node accept payment request simply complete 
exist fair exchange schemes agree outcomes expensive computationally numbers interactions 
nature services may prevent nodes determining exactly service fulfilled point request
