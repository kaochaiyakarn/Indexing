reconsider notion plaintext awareness 
new model plaintext aware encryption natural useful 
achieve plaintext aware encryption random oracles third party 
need trust third party third party dishonest guarantee security adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks 
show construction achieves definition general assumptions 
motivate achievement showing important natural application giving additional real world meaningfulness model 
put forward implement new notion plaintext aware encryption natural useful 
beautiful controversial notion 
introduced bellare rogaway see refinements encryption scheme plaintext aware pa adversary creates ciphertext know corresponding plaintext 
despite natural appeal pa encryption somewhat controversial main reasons 
plaintext awareness fundamentally relies random oracles 
known implementations pa encryption random oracles definition plaintext awareness far crucially depended 
random oracles fundamentally constructs 
realized algorithmically hope exists traditional pa encryption requires random oracle random oracle 
random oracle essence trusted third party interacts rest rigid way puts string special query tape write random bit bx special answer tape 
codified interface guarantees adversary purposely tries know doing aware queries random oracle explicitly write bit query tape 
elementary awareness cleverly exploited bellare rogaway imply sophisticated awareness looking just queries adversary random oracle computation ciphertext easily deduce underlying plaintext 
random oracle provides magical window state encrypting algorithm forcing disclose parts internal state 
hardly fault inventors plaintext awareness depending random oracles additional help plaintext awareness looks essentially impossible 

plaintext awareness important novel applications 
plaintext awareness strong property immediately implies security chosen ciphertext attacks cca security exact notation 
essence adversary knows answer receive decryption oracle oracle gives additional power 
cca secure schemes known constructed cramer shoup decisional diffie hellman assumption yielding efficient scheme sahai improving previous naor yung general complexity assumptions

new definition pa encryption random oracle 

implementation new definition general complexity assumptions 

new natural application pa encryption requires full power 
sure need access trusted third party party natural practice access encryption 
essence definition 
model simple encryption available users properly registered public keys registration authority plaintext awareness guaranteed authority honest 
third party model attractive features safety plaintext awareness scheme depends honesty registration authority 
particular security 
registration authority collaborated adversary scheme guaranteed cca secure 
naturalness trusted registration authority essentially implicit actual implementation public key encryption 
implementations enforce correct association users public keys requiring users register public key certification authority 
authorities verify identity applicant applicant knows corresponding secret key 
system users separate keys sending receiving messages definitions require sending keys key registered 
natural require users register sending keys time receiving keys certified certificate authority act registering authority 
efficiency said random oracle thought trusted third party 
bellare rogaway model trusted third party accessed time ciphertext generated 
contrast model different trusted party accessed registered users generate ciphertexts 
sure quite general implementation propose efficient inefficiency due model 
essence implementation 
scheme key registration process sender simply gives zero knowledge proof knowledge secret sending key 
proof system zero knowledge registration authority honest dishonest gains information 
encryption message depend public keys sender receiver
