importance scientific explanation scientific explanation draw explanation argumentation literature 
explanation happens brown 
specifically scientists explain phenomena determining occur conditions consequences observed event nagel 
argumentation verbal written oral social activity aimed justifying defending standpoint audience van 
combine goals explanation argumentation practice call scientific explanation 
mentioned previously want support students justifying explanations scientific phenomena support context specific vs generic scaffolds claims appropriate evidence reasoning 
chose call inquiry practice scientific explanation align national state science standards teachers need address 
explanation nagel argumentation driver newton osborne discussed core practices scientists 
consequently want students engage authentic science learning practices need part experience 
authentic situation mean similar john brown colleagues defined authentic practice ordinary practice practitioner culture quite different classroom culture 
terms science education means students engage practices allow think act scientists 
example colleagues argue science discovering memorizing facts constructing explanations phenomena 
type explanation construction occurs community scientists different explanations compared debated 
scientific knowledge far complex situated scientific community recognized roth 
construction scientific knowledge collective social process occurs conflict argument simple agreement latour 
scientific knowledge truth model current scientific community agrees explain occurrences natural phenomena kuhn 
consequently explanation argumentation core features authentic scientific practice scientists justify explanations phenomena occur 
idea students engage explanation argumentation authentic scientific practice number education researchers engaging students explanation argumentation multiple benefits student learning 
example engaging students scientific explanation increase students ability reason justify claims increase understanding content possibly alter view science 
goals having students engage explanation argumentation classroom instruction increase ability perform scientific inquiry practice 
goal help students able justify claims 
number studies students engage scientific inquiry practice ability construct explanations arguments increases 
example previous conducted colleagues mcneill engaging students week unit scientific explanation explicit goal written curricular scaffolds resulted students increased performance ability justify claims appropriate evidence reasoning written explanations 
schwarz colleagues fifth grade students engaged argumentative activities supported technology tools quality arguments increased hours instruction students provided increasingly relevant reasons claims 
studied high school students general science class classroom norms instruction focused argumentation open inquiry 
weeks instruction students arguments explicitly linked evidence claims included theoretical framework incorporating subject matter knowledge select evidence justify claims 
increasing students ability engage inquiry practices classroom science hope type instruction increase students ability reason science outside classroom 
example ann brown colleagues suggest authentic practice foster kinds thinking important school context specific vs generic scaffolds activities prepare students lifelong intentional learners 
zohar examined engagement genetics unit focused argumentation encourage th grade students transfer argumentation skills taught context dilemmas taken everyday life 
specifically genetics unit provided students dilemma student cheating test school 
students able transfer argumentation skills genetics unit resulting students constructing stronger arguments everyday dilemma unit compared 
study suggests argumentation skills transferred contexts studies conducted transfer 
research needs occur understand students transfer understanding scientific explanation argumentation science class contexts inside outside school 
terms students conceptual knowledge number studies show students engage classroom instruction explanation argumentation explicit goal increase understanding content 
example bell middle school students engaged argumentation software debate light propagation students conceptual understanding light reflection absorption energy conversation increased 
colleagues students conceptual knowledge key chemistry concepts increases ability construct scientific explanations week unit key focus instruction writing scientific explanations mcneill press 
zohar conducted comparison study examine th grade students developed stronger conceptual understanding genetic ideas engaged curriculum focused scientific argumentation moral dilemmas traditional genetics unit lasted amount time 
genetics unit focused argumentation resulted greater student conceptual understanding 
provide variety possible reasons outcome including argumentation unit encouraged higher order cognitive experiences enabled students build richer mental representations interesting students highly motivated learn content encouraged variety different activity structures teacher centered encouraged social construction knowledge 
studies suggest instructional units focused explanation argumentation promote students understanding conceptual knowledge better traditional units 
scientific explanations frame goal inquiry understanding natural phenomena articulating convincing understanding reiser 
highlights idea scientists socially construct knowledge science 
students view science static set facts truths scientists collected time doing experiments 
detrimental terms students understanding nature science students dynamic views science may acquire integrated conceptual understandings 
having students take part explanation construction socially construct justify knowledge claims may change refine students image science bell 
smith colleagues th graders constructivist inquiry oriented classroom fairly sophisticated views knowledge constructed science

instructional model scientific explanation order support teachers students complex practice constructing scientific explanations developed instructional model scientific explanation 
similar science educators bell driver simon osborne jim nez rodr guez lee saul instructional model builds toulmin model argumentation 
instructional model breaks explanation components claim evidence reasoning 
claim assertion answers original question 
evidence scientific data supports claim 
data come investigation source observations reading material archived data 
data need appropriate sufficient support claim 
appropriate mean data relevant problem helps determine support claim 
sufficient refers providing data convince individual claim 
providing sufficient evidence requires multiple pieces data 
reasoning justification shows data count evidence support claim 
reasoning component encourage students articulate logic believe evidence supports claim
