activities problems status quo described thoroughly publication pachet 
ontology able handle multiple inheritances concepts tracks albums artists outperforms standard subsumption hierarchies mp sites 
concepts musical properties linked automatic audio processing loudness tempo timbre 
novelty introduced semantic link contains lyrics grounded ascii text document database 

music database mir system accesses musical data underlying database 
prototype private cd collection mp format kbps 
scope dataset tracks covering artists approx 
different genres 
administrative information artist title album gathered usage 
unfortunately data quality insufficient automatic processing 
inconsistencies artist title volume tags removed genre information remained useless automatic processing 
genre tags set manually 
experiments hand lyrics added plain ascii text 

audio analysis nlp automatic audio analysis recognizes properties loud quiet fast slow mp subband features determination similarity 
extraction approaches pfeiffer 
natural language processing nlp approaches lie extremes key word processing disregard word relations context complete understanding 
applicable pragmatic processing natural language music queries 
approach processing partial abstraction especially suited music search requests limited domain high speed requirements offers optimum trade processing speed reaction scope requests 
query interface front nlp component confused typing errors 
additionally system able connect artist names sound similar able produce results phonetic similarity fil collins vs phil collins 
general purpose sequence distance methods investigated past 
phonetic fuzzy match super convenience non musicians querying mp semantic web system german research center artificial intelligence subject

exploring lyrics started experiments concerning similarity lyrics implications perception music similarity 
state art document retrieval classification approaches commercialized successfully adopted real world problems 
api commercial tool text classification workbench submodules developed institute 
prot tool convenient design ontologies 
top level concept lyrics broken taxonomy typical topics covered mainstream music 
handcrafted topic ontology may supported semi automatic ontology learning document clustering approaches 
current experiments focused subsymbolic level lyrics 
state art document retrieval classification approaches missing depth ontological support 
basic techniques long standing tradition information retrieval applied domain lyrics 
tools allow different functionalities 
query boolean retrieval model consists boolean combination tests occurrence specific words 
instance query hate love girls tests document contains words hate love word girls 
go boolean retrieval additional functionality integrated vector space model vsm 
model lyrics queries represented vectors 
dimension vectors indicate specific terms value vectors component indicates number times respective term occurs lyrics query represented 
defining similarity measure vectors standard document retrieval queries vsm 
frequently measure cosine measure computes angle vectors 
having vector representing query documents corresponding similar document vectors returned answer documents 
way realize computation similarity lyrics 
queries lyrics vsm represented vectors similarity vectors representing just lyrics computed 
roughly spoken lyrics share important words high similarity 
computing relevant terms perform kind summarization 
functionality similarity terms computable allowing automated term expansion mapping taxonomy topics music ontology 
lyrics collection contains documents 
querying terms topics easy perform challenging approach examine term similarities document similarities 
show typical results stereotypes common result cases approach 
simplification reduced presentation relevant terms song top similar songs applying standard metrics vector space model 
song phil collins night relevant terms forever wait night cos similar collins cant hurry love collins inside collins love song cat stevens father son relevant terms fault decision marry son settle similar collins re sons fathers crow said easy george michael father song lucy pearl dance tonight relevant terms toast spend tonight dance money similar lucy pearl feat 
snoop phil collins please come tonight groove 
song das kind vor dem 
relevant terms similar auf der mit dir song paradise features remains pas encore fois similar zero hits 
discussion non musicians may query musical database remembering parts lyrics 
evaluation na listeners class queries essentially non restricted user interface 
integrated approach handle queries 
artists cope theme complete album set albums 
similarity metrics term frequencies deliver appropriate results phenomena see example 
topics genre boundaries see example intention topic queries neglecting musical genres 
topics represented specific genres see example 
music talks dancing parties vibes 
specific vocabularies typical specific styles german hip hop see example 
impression evaluated thoroughly 
large corpora multi lingual entities obviously necessary cope lyrics different languages 
initial corpus small cope languages different english german see example 
see lot potential kind combined theory affective computing 
lyrics ir techniques create automatically meaningful terms topics 
emotional perception topic war vs peace may coupled emotional perception audio surface structure minor vs major 
way concept moods provided automatically user queries 
concept super convenience time 
framework established cross fertilization different research disciplines mainly area ai
