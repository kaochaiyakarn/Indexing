user agent known service external clients ask variety information user represents user determines control policies agent 
clients query location query service organized regions centralized server called location broker running region

spreitzer theimer propose alternative architecture multicast st 
clients just multicast location queries members domain multicast group 
interested parties anonymously listen domain multicast group hear location queries 
answer query match current privacy policy allows 
disadvantage approach increased computation communication 
advantage central server needed members maintain privacy 

security privacy key problems context aware system security st ensuring accuracy location information identities establishing secret communications 
authenticating supplied location information difficult today sensor systems typically detect things active badges removed mobile object represent 
addition protecting content communication address content protected prevent leaking location information 
surprisingly people idea precisely located anytime especially location data logged 
important address privacy issues context aware computing 
existing context sensitive systems provide satisfactory solution current stage systems choose ignore security privacy concerns 
perfect privacy guarantees general hard expensive provide st 
user able control contextual information may gain access 
system architecture needs provide user controllable tradeoffs privacy guarantees functionality efficiency 
difficult specific context information visible 
problem technology rarely inherently bad just bad purposes 
existing systems may abused compromise people privacy due bad management policy 
technologies vulnerable legislation may necessary ensure user contextual information misused
