recommender systems systems eliciting user feedback 
rating documents onerous task users fewer ratings required better 
pure content approach user ratings factor influencing performance way reduce quantity reducing performance 
collaborative recommendation collaborative approach recommendation different recommend items similar items user liked past recommend items similar users liked 
compute similarity items compute similarity users 
typically user set nearest neighbor users past ratings strongest correlation 
scores unseen items predicted combination scores known nearest neighbors

pure collaborative recommendation solves shortcomings pure content systems 
users recommendations deal kind content receive items dissimilar content seen past 
users feedback influences recommended potential maintain effective performance fewer ratings individual user 
approach introduce certain problems 
new item appears database way recommended user information obtained user rating specifying items similar 
number users small relative volume information system large rapidly changing database danger coverage ratings sparse thinning collection recommendable items 
second problem simply user tastes unusual compared rest population users particularly similar leading poor recommendations 

pages relevant specific topics collected web 
selections individual users pages 
problems critically depend size composition user population influence user group nearest neighbors 
situation feedback fails cause group nearest neighbors change expressing dislike item necessarily prevent user receiving similar items 
furthermore lack access content items prevents similar users matched rated exact items 
user liked cnn weather page liked msnbc weather page necessarily nearest neighbors 
create hybrid content collaborative system maintain user profiles content analysis directly compare profiles determine similar users collaborative recommendation
