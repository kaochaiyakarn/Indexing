keywords presentation teams animated characters conversational embodied agents believable dialogues trying imitate skills human presenters projects begun deploy animated characters agents knowledge presentation systems 
particular strength animated characters ability express emotions believable way combining facial expressions body gestures affective speech 
furthermore provide effective means conveying conversational signals turns awaiting feedback difficult communicate traditional media text graphics 
results empirical studies show animated characters may strong motivational impact users experience presentations animated characters lively engaging 
frequently systems presentation agents rely settings agent addresses user directly face face conversation human beings 
setting quite appropriate number applications draw distinguished agent user relationship 
example agent may serve personal guide assistant information spaces world wide web aia persona user personal consultant tutor herman bug steve may come real estate sales person tries convince individual customer rea agent :10.1.1.31.711
situations emulation direct agent user communication necessarily effective way information 
standard user 
members user population differ widely regard personality individual preferences certain style acquiring new information 
fact people feel comfortable approached directly agent 
investigate new style presenting information 
introduce notion presentation teams addressing user directly convey information style performances observed 
called transmissions tv designed advertisement clips examples demonstrate information conveyed appealing manner multiple presenters complementary characters role 
avoid misunderstanding emphasize intended argue degrading user role passive viewer difference time tv computer screen 
argue performances presentation teams useful additions repertoire presentation techniques intelligent presentation systems 
fact presentation teams contribute success presentation regard aspects presentation teams convey certain relationships information units canonical way 
things benefit decision support systems user informed different incompatible points views pairs arguments counter arguments alternative suggestions 
solving presentation tasks quite natural structure presentations argumentative rhetorical strategies common real dialogues conversational partners 
instance debate characters representing contrary opinions effective means providing audience pros cons issue 
single members presentation team serve indices help user classify conveyed information 
example sales presentation may financial technical aspects strictly separated sales assistant technician 
may indicate occurrence important events unique notification agent different applications 
furthermore different agents convey meta information origin information unit reliability source 
aware empirical studies labeling effect viewer recall information 
character audio visual appearance 
character recognized index expect effects similar studies supporting dual encoding theory 
presentation teams serve rhetorical devices allow continuous reinforcement beliefs 
example enable repeat information monotonous manner simply employing different agents convey 
furthermore arguments may reinforced presenting agents accepted audience 
example quite common tv ads pseudo experts increase credibility conveyed information 
regards attempts area collaborative browsing multiple presenters allow performances account certain extent different interest profiles diverse audience

designing presentation dialogues basic steps approach observation vivid believable dialogues fact means information audience 
certain discourse purpose set information units determine appropriate dialogue type define roles characters involved recruit concrete characters personality profiles go assigned roles details single dialogue turns performed characters 
dialogue types character roles structure performance predetermined choice dialogue type depends presentation goal 
restrict sales dialogues chats jointly watched events 
certain dialogue type chosen need define roles occupied characters 
dialogue types induce certain constraints required roles 
instance debate certain subject matter proponent opponent role filled 
sales scenario need seller customer 
step occupation designated roles appropriate characters 
generate effective performances simply multiply existing character 
characters realized distinguishable individuals areas expertise interest profiles personalities audio visual appearance account specific task context 
agent personality represented vector discrete values number psychological traits openness uniquely characterize individual 
personality traits influenced current events remain stable longer period time 
closely related personality concept emotion 
contrast personality emotions short lived influenced character current situation 
intensity emotion strongly depends character personality 
instance hot tempered soccer fan get angry team misses goal chance balanced character

speech act theoretic view represent simulated dialogues sequence communicative acts achieve certain goals 
automatically generate dialogues investigating approaches actors scripted behaviors approach system appears role producer generates script actors play

approach facilitates generation coherent dialogues script writer completely controls structure dialogue 
requires knowledge communicated priori known

depending role personality characters may pursue completely different goals 
instance customer sales situation usually tries get information certain product order decision seller aims presenting product positive light 
generate believable dialogues ensure assigned dialogue contributions conflict character goal 
characters differ respect communicative goals respect communicative behavior 
depending personality emotions may apply completely different dialogue strategies 
instance shy agent take initiative dialogue exhibit passive behavior 
agent able say depends area expertise 
planning approaches allow consider characters profile treating additional constraint selection instantiation dialogue strategies 
agents strictly follow script script approach room improvisation performance time
