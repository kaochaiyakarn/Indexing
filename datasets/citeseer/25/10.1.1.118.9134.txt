scenario common people world wide web 
major problem searching web today data available web little semantic organization simple structural arrangement text declared keywords titles abstracts 
web expands exponentially size lack organization difficult efficiently glean knowledge web state art natural language processing techniques index mechanisms assistance army data entry workers assembling hand web catalogs 
short effective way world wide web answer query find web pages person person organization lastname cook lastname cook employee employee dod searching web chief intent html assist userlevel presentation navigation internet automated search sophisticated knowledge gathering lower priority 
emphasis relatively mechanisms established mark documents useful semantic information information table contents 
result common indexing mechanisms agent robots world wide web generally fallen categories text indexing engines 
catalogs built hand 
private robots ad hoc methods gather limited semantic information pages links broken page links 
approach disadvantages 
text indices suffer associate semantic meaning web pages actual lexical syntactic content previous example searching keyword index cook yielded tremendous numbers web pages living people named cook 
cook uses name 
text indices improving amount information web growing rapidly 
major disadvantage hand built catalogs required construct 
size world wide web rate growing cataloging modest percentage web pages task 
additionally criteria building catalog may turn orthogonal interest user 
ad hoc robots attempt gather semantic information web typically gather limited semantic information inferable existing html tags 
current state natural language processing technology difficult infer semantic meaning body text reasonable rate 
experience limiting web robot natural language understanding small topic computer science web pages proves surprisingly difficult implement ad hoc methods algorithms extremely brittle 
approaches specific domains allows inferences relationships web pages aside simple facts linkage 
sophisticated queries initial cook example clearly reach 
solution adding semantics html trying glean knowledge existing html approach give authors ability embed knowledge directly html pages making simple user agents robots retrieve store knowledge 
straightforward way provide authors clean superset html adds knowledge markup syntax enable directly classify web pages detail web pages relationships attributes machine readable form html 
language document claim home page graduate student 
link page research group declare graduate student works group research assistant 
page assert cook graduate student name 
claims simple keywords semantic tags defined official set attributes relationships ontology 
example ontology include attributes lastname classifications person relationships employee 
systems gather claims attributes relationships resulting gathered knowledge provide answers sophisticated knowledge queries 
user agents robots gathered semantic information refine web crawling process 
example consider intelligent agent task gather web pages cooking 
agent thesaurus lookup keyword search mechanism accidentally decide helena cook web page pages linked search candidates topic 
bad mistake course obvious reasons helena cook links rest university maryland works 
university maryland web server network large robot waste great deal time fruitless searching 
agent gathered semantic tags helena cook web page indicated cook name agent know better search web page links

address problems dobson attempted reconcile html entity relationship er database model

documents may contain entities necessary 
dobson associate entity unique key establish relationships url links keys 
dobson er scheme significant improvement html existing mechanism provide ontological declarations 
example scheme give clear mechanism classification hierarchy classes 
significant uses semantics documents categorize classification scheme taxonomy 
example documents classified hierarchical schemes library congress subject headings dewey decimal system universal decimal classification 
similarly semantics mechanism world wide web documents needs ability flexible hierarchical classification 
ability establish relationships web entities important secondary ability classify entities 
er model allow specify inferences drawn relationships web pages

addition powerful inferential rule capabilities full knowledge base semantics provided 
shoe developed small superset html provides mechanisms 
scheme called shoe simple html ontology extensions 
shoe intended provide user agents easy access machinereadable semantic knowledge web 
adding html simple knowledge representation language 
shoe provides ability define ontologies html lay classifica tions entity relationship rules

shoe intentionally semantic completeness powerful knowledge representation schemes attempts strike balance full knowledge representation semantics unique needs world wide web agents rapidly collect query large bodies information distributed chaotic domain

web knowledge representation issues world wide web provide knowledge representation kr agents shoe address number issues normally common kr domains 
example body knowledge web constant flux 
ontologies may obsolete soon popular 
shoe addresses ways 
shoe ontology versioning allows ontologies updated newer versions retaining integrity 
second shoe lets ontologies extend existing ontologies reflect specialized information 
shoe develop hierarchy ontologies parent ontologies high hierarchy may reflect standardized classification knowledge world wide web query result parka relationships child ontologies extend parents may reflect current rapidly changing information narrow specialized fields 
important issue complete lack control knowledge web 
traditional kr domains agents web deal incomplete incorrect unavailable information unknown sources unknown value 
shoe attempts addresses concern ways 
shoe includes protocol generating unique keys data entities ensures entity counterfeit entity different document 
second assertions shoe assumed claims facts 
true relation best expressed asr 
adds claim source additional variable considering claim validity 
third shoe allows assertions negations retractions 
relations multivalued 
ensures entity retract replace entity claim 
shoe attempts bring sensibility claims may specifying legal entity classifications data types domain range relationship claims 
final issue sheer size potential web data 
knowledge representation languages systems kif provide rich semantics cost computational complexity np complete worse algorithms uncommon 
ordinarily costs associated semantic expressiveness reasonable size common kr domains relatively small 
systems may scale large domains cost comprehensive semantic expressiveness overwhelming 
web easily domain conceivably yielding millions instances assertions 
shoe intentionally semantic expressivity help handle large amounts data agents web
