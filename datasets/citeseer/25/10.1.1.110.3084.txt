growth world wide web come insight currently available methods finding information web insufficient 
today retrieval methods typically limited keyword searches matches sub strings offering support deeper structures lie hidden data people typically reason users may critical information searching web 
time structure posted data flat increases difficulty interpreting data consistently 
higher level computational operations need compare query analyze combine integrate data carried due lack methods compatible information available 
exist higher potential exploiting web tools available better match human reasoning 
vein research community begun effort investigate foundations stage web called semantic web 
current efforts include extensible markup language xml resource description framework rdf topic maps darpa agent markup language daml oil 
late early days object orientation currently different research approaches semantic web ground breaking experimental incompatible incoherent 
rich domain requires special attention semantics geospatial information 
enormous variety encodings geospatial semantics particularly challenging process requests geospatial information 
area gis interoperability led open gis consortium addressed basic issues primarily related geometry geospatial features 
geography markup language gml provides syntactic approach encoding geospatial information net gml gml html language symbols need interpreted users associated behavior accounted 
semantic web approaches provide generic frameworks describe ontologies capture semantics relate explicitly basic geospatial properties web users require kinds entities relationships useful particular information processing task 
current approaches address issue particular semantics exploited people searching web accomplish particular task
