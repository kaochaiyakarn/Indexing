particular dsr support rapid rates arbitrary node mobility assume nodes continuously move rapidly flooding individual data packet possible routing protocol 
assume nodes may able enable promiscuous receive mode wireless network interface hardware causing hardware deliver received packet network driver software filtering link layer destination address 
require facility example common current lan hardware broadcast media including wireless optimizations take advantage availability 
promiscuous mode increase software overhead cpu believe wireless network speeds inherent limiting factor performance current systems believe portions protocol suitable implementation directly programmable network interface unit avoid overhead cpu johnson 
promiscuous mode may increase power consumption network interface hardware depending design receiver hardware cases dsr easily optimizations depend promiscuous receive mode programmed periodically switch interface promiscuous mode 
wireless communication ability pair nodes may times equally directions due example differing antenna propagation patterns sources interference nodes lauer 
wireless communications pair nodes cases able operate bi directionally times wireless link nodes may uni directional allowing node successfully send packets communication possible reverse direction 
routing protocols operate correctly bidirectional links dsr successfully discover forward packets paths contain uni directional links

dsr protocol description overview important properties protocol dsr protocol composed mechanisms allow discovery maintenance source routes ad hoc network route discovery mechanism node wishing send packet destination node obtains source route route discovery attempts send packet know route route maintenance mechanism node able detect source route network topology changed longer route link route longer works 
route maintenance indicates source route broken attempt route happens know invoke route discovery find new route 
route maintenance sending packets route discovery route maintenance operate entirely demand 
particular protocols dsr requires periodic packets kind level network 
example dsr periodic routing advertisement link status sensing neighbor detection packets rely functions underlying protocols network 
entirely demand behavior lack periodic activity allows number overhead packets caused dsr scale way zero nodes approximately stationary respect routes needed current communication discovered 
nodes move communication patterns change routing packet overhead dsr automatically scales needed track routes currently 
response single route discovery routing information packets overheard node may learn cache multiple routes destination 
allows reaction routing changes rapid node multiple routes destination try cached route fail 
caching multiple routes avoids overhead needing perform new route discovery time route breaks 
operation route discovery route maintenance dsr designed allow uni directional links asymmetric routes easily supported 
particular noted section wireless networks possible link nodes may equally directions due differing antenna propagation patterns sources interference 
dsr allows uni directional links necessary improving performance network connectivity system 
dsr supports internetworking different types wireless networks allowing source route composed hops combination types networks available broch

basic dsr route discovery node originates new packet destined node places header packet source route giving sequence hops packet follow way normally obtain suitable source route searching route cache routes previously learned route cache initiate route discovery protocol dynamically find new route case call initiator target route discovery 
example illustrates example route discovery node attempting discover route node initiate route discovery transmits route request message single local broadcast packet received approximately nodes currently wireless transmission range route request message identifies initiator target route discovery contains unique request id determined initiator request 
route request contains record listing address intermediate node particular copy route request message forwarded 
route record initialized empty list initiator route discovery 
id id id id route discovery example node initiator node target 
node receives route request target route discovery returns route reply message initiator route discovery giving copy accumulated route record route request initiator receives route reply caches route route cache sending subsequent packets destination 
node receiving route request seen route request message initiator bearing request id finds address listed route record route request message discards request 
node appends address route record route request message propagates transmitting local broadcast packet request id 
returning route reply initiator route discovery node replying back node typically examine route cache route back source route delivery packet containing route reply 
may perform route discovery target node avoid possible infinite recursion route discoveries piggyback route reply route request message possible piggyback small data packets tcp syn packet postel route request mechanism 
node simply reverse sequence hops route record trying send route reply source route packet carrying route reply 
mac protocols ieee require bi directional frame exchange part mac protocol ieee route reversal preferred avoids overhead possible second route discovery tests discovered route ensure bi directional route discovery initiator begins route 
technique prevent discovery routes uni directional links 
wireless environments uni directional links permitted routes may cases efficient bi directional links may way achieve connectivity target node 
initiating route discovery sending node saves copy original packet local buffer called send buffer 
send buffer contains copy packet transmitted node source route packet destination 
packet send buffer stamped time placed buffer discarded residing send buffer timeout period necessary preventing send buffer overflowing fifo replacement strategy evict packets expire 
packet remains send buffer node occasionally initiate new route discovery packet destination address 
node limit rate new route discoveries address initiated possible destination node currently reachable 
particular due limited wireless transmission range movement nodes network network may times partitioned meaning currently sequence nodes packet forwarded reach destination 
depending movement pattern density nodes network network partitions may rare may common 
new route discovery initiated packet sent node situation large number unproductive route request packets propagated subset ad hoc network route maintenance example node unable forward packet link hop reachable node 
order reduce overhead route discoveries exponential back limit rate new route discoveries may initiated node target 
node attempts send additional data packets node frequently limit subsequent packets buffered send buffer route reply received node initiate new route discovery minimum allowable interval new route discoveries target reached 
limitation maximum rate route discoveries target similar mechanism required internet nodes limit rate arp requests sent single target ip address braden 
basic dsr route maintenance originating forwarding packet source route node transmitting packet responsible confirming packet received hop source route packet retransmitted maximum number attempts confirmation receipt received 
example situation illustrated node originated packet source route intermediate nodes case node responsible receipt packet node responsible receipt node responsible receipt node responsible receipt destination confirmation receipt cases may provided cost dsr existing standard part mac protocol link level frame defined ieee ieee passive jubin example confirms receipt overhearing transmit packet forward 
confirmation mechanisms available node transmitting packet may set bit packet header request dsr specific software returned hop software normally transmitted directly sending node link nodes uni directional software may travel different multi hop path 
packet retransmitted hop maximum number times receipt confirmation received node returns route error message original sender packet identifying link packet forwarded 
example unable deliver packet hop returns route error stating link currently broken node removes broken link cache retransmission original packet function upper layer protocols tcp 
sending retransmission packets destination route cache route example additional route earlier route discovery having overheard sufficient routing information packets send packet new route immediately 
may perform new route discovery target subject exponential backoff described section 
additional route discovery features caching overheard routing information node forwarding overhearing packet may add routing information packet route cache 
particular source route data packet accumulated route record limitations caching overheard routing information node forwarding packets overhears packets route request route returned route reply may cached node 
routing information packets received may cached packet addressed node sent broadcast multicast mac address received node network interface promiscuous mode 
limitation caching overheard routing information possible presence uni directional links ad hoc network section 
example illustrates situation node source route communicate node node forwards data packet route add cache presence forward direction links learns headers packets reverse direction links identified packet headers back may links uni directional 
knows links fact bi directional example due mac protocol cache 
likewise node different source route communicate node node overhears node transmitting data packet forward node consider links involved known bi directional caching 
link data packet received known bi directional cache link link link links assumed bi directional cache links similar considerations apply routing information learned forwarded overheard route request route reply packets 
replying route requests cached routes node receiving route request target searches route cache route target request 
node generally returns route reply initiator forwarding route request 
route reply sets route record list sequence hops copy route request forwarded concatenated idea route target route cache 
transmitting route reply packet generated information route cache way node verify resulting route returned route reply concatenation contains duplicate nodes listed route record 
example illustrates case route request target received node node route cache route concatenation accumulated route route request cached route route cache include duplicate node passing back route cache possible duplication route hops avoided route discovery limitation replying route requests route cache 
node case attempt edit route eliminate duplication resulting route case node route returned route reply 
dsr route discovery prohibits node returning route reply cache reasons 
limitation increases probability resulting route valid case received route error route previously stopped working 
second limitation means route error traversing route pass node sent route reply route including helps ensure stale data removed caches timely manner 
route discovery initiated contaminated route reply containing stale route 
route request meet restrictions node node example discards route request replying propagating 
preventing route reply storms ability nodes reply route request information route caches described section result possible route reply storm cases 
particular node broadcasts route request target node node neighbors route route caches neighbor may attempt send route reply wasting bandwidth possibly increasing number network collisions area 
example situation shown nodes receive route request target indicated route cached target 
normally attempt reply route caches send time received broadcast route request time 
simultaneous replies different nodes receiving route request may create packet collisions replies may cause local congestion wireless network 
addition case different replies indicate routes different lengths shown example 
node put network interface promiscuous receive mode delay sending route reply short period listening see initiating node begins shorter route 
node delay sending route reply random period length number network hops route returned node route reply random number small constant delay twice maximum wireless link propagation delay introduced hop 
delay effectively randomizes time route reply storm result nodes reply route request route caches 
route listed node shows route destination currently listed node route cache 
node sends route reply nodes sending route giving routes length sending node nodes sending route giving routes length greater sending node 
delay period node receives packets looking data packets initiator route discovery destined target discovery 
data packet received node delay period uses source route length equal node may infer initiator route discovery received route reply giving equally better route 
case node cancels delay timer send route reply route discovery 
route request hop limits route request message contains hop limit may limit number intermediate nodes allowed forward copy route request 
request forwarded limit decremented request packet discarded limit reaches zero finding target 
currently mechanism send route request hop limit inexpensive method determining target currently neighbor initiator neighbor node route target cached effectively neighbors caches extension initiator cache 
route reply received short timeout propagating route request hop limit sent 
considered mechanism implement expanding ring search target johnson 
example node send initial route request described route reply received node initiate route request hop limit 
route request initiated route reply received node double hop limit previous attempt progressively explore target node allowing route request propagate entire network 
expanding ring search approach effect increasing average latency route discovery multiple discovery attempts timeouts may needed discovering route target node 
node notices source route shortened overheard packet intended additional route maintenance features packet sending route error message part route maintenance described section node may attempt salvage data packet caused route error discarding 
attempt salvage packet node sending route error searches route cache route destination packet causing error 
route node may salvage packet returning route error replacing original source route packet route route cache 
node forwards packet node indicated source route 
example node route cached node salvage packet applying route packet discarding packet 
packet way packet marked having prevent single packet multiple times 
possible packet enter routing loop different nodes repeatedly salvage packet replace source route packet routes 
alternative mechanism considered replace unused suffix original route portion advance node new route node route cache forming new route prefix original route suffix route cache 
case normal rules avoiding duplicated nodes listed source route sufficient avoid routing loops 
mechanism prevent new route backtracking node earlier node traversed packet forwarded different remaining sequence hops destination 
current mechanism allows backtracking prevents packet 
automatic route shortening source routes may automatically shortened intermediate hops route longer necessary 
mechanism automatically shortening routes somewhat passive 
particular node able overhear packet carrying source route operating network interface promiscuous receive mode node examines unused portion source route 
node intended hop packet named unused portion packet source route infer intermediate nodes source route longer needed route 
example illustrates example node overheard data packet transmitted forwarding arrow pointing node source route packet indicates intended receiver packet route 
case node node returns gratuitous route reply message original sender packet node 
route reply gives shorter route concatenation portion original source route node transmitted overheard packet plus suffix original source route node returning gratuitous route reply 
example route returned gratuitous route reply message sent gives new route sequence hops increased spreading route error messages source node receives route error data packet originated source node propagates route error neighbors piggybacking route request 
way stale information caches nodes source node generate route contain invalid link source node received route error 
example situation shown node learns route error message link currently broken 
removes link route cache initiates new route discovery doesn route route cache 
route request packet initiating route discovery node piggybacks copy route error message ensuring route error message spreads nodes guaranteeing route reply receives including node route caches response route request contain route assumes existence broken link 
considered simulated improvement route maintenance node receives route error forward error source route resulted error 
guarantee route error reaches node generated route reply containing broken link prevent node route discovery broken link 
caching negative information cases dsr potentially benefit nodes caching negative information route caches 
example node caches fact link currently broken simply removing hop route cache guarantee route reply receives response new route discovery accepted utilizes broken link 
short expiration period placed negative cached information entry route cache refuse allow link cache link begins working 
case caching negative information node route cache useful case link providing highly variable service working correctly working 
situation occur example case link near limit sending node wireless transmission range significant sources interference multipath near receiving node link 
case caching negative information link broken node avoid adding problematic link back route cache brief periods working correctly 
currently included caching negative information simulations implementation dsr situations dsr testbed implementation section potentially improve performance route discovery maltz 
challenge implementing caching negative information currently researching difficulty picking suitable expiration period cache entries
