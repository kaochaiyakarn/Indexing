forage state mentioned corresponds wander state 

avoid static obstacle moving objects 
schemas escape dodge non cooperative moving objects appropriate 

di erences areas test scenarios generated happens robots fail complete task restrictions robot movement 
new simulator obstacles allowed overlap 
previously allowed resulting accurate accounting obstacle coverage 
research robots initially placed center environment home base 
earlier research placed randomly environment 
authors believe single starting location robots real world implementations 
previous simulator allowed runs exceed maximum steps 
run exceeded time limit halted discarded 
limit raised steps runs timeout counted time steps 
new simulator robots allowed move outside visual boundaries environment previously case 

graze percent area varied increments 
allows di culty tobe varied discrete steps 
results directly compared forage consume tasks attractors
