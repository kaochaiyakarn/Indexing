collaboration web services framework defines general architecture global mmcs services videoconferencing services may include different collaboration systems sip accessgrid system 
real server added streaming web service 
global mmcs sip proxies servers provide instant messaging service 
allow users multiple types clients access global mmcs system including terminals sip endpoints mbone tools real windows media players 
collaboration pattern usually divided categories ad hoc mode scheduled mode 
ad hoc needs instant messenger provide chat remote presence services 
implement dynamic membership quite suitable small group informal collaborations 
scheduled mode needs meeting calendar prepare formal collaboration 
people log web site emails reservation virtual meeting room send invitations attendee advance 
scheduled mode better formal large scale collaborations 
global mmcs support hybrid collaboration pattern allows users integrate possible collaboration services example videoconferencing streaming im shared application
