models ir research vector space model probabilistic models inference network model 
vector space model vector space model text represented vector terms 
definition term inherent model terms typically words phrases 
words chosen terms word vocabulary independent dimension high dimensional vector space 
text represented vector high dimensional space 
term belongs text gets non zero value text vector dimension corresponding term 
text contains limited set terms vocabulary millions terms text vectors sparse 
vector systems operate positive quadrant vector space term assigned negative value 
assign numeric score document query model measures similarity query vector query just text converted vector document vector 
similarity vectors inherent model 
typically angle vectors measure divergence vectors cosine angle numeric similarity trec nist gov cosine nice property identical vectors orthogonal vectors 
alternative inner product dot product vectors similarity measure 
vectors forced unit length cosine angle vectors dot product

arrive defined model quite critical search effectiveness ir system referred weight term document discussed detail section 
probabilistic models family ir models general principle documents collection ranked decreasing probability relevance query 
called probabilistic ranking principle prp 
true probabilities available ir system probabilistic ir models estimate probability relevance documents query 
estimation key part model probabilistic models differ 
initial idea probabilistic retrieval proposed maron kuhns published 
probabilistic models proposed different probability estimation technique 
due space limitations possible discuss details models 
description abstracts common basis models 
denote probability relevance document 
ranking criteria monotonic log odds transformation rank documents probability document non relevant 
simple bayes transform 
assuming prior probability relevance independent document consideration constant documents just scaling factors final document scores removed formulation ranking purposes 
simplifies formulation 
assumptions estimation different probabilistic models start diverging point 
simplest form model assume terms typically words mutually independent called independence assumption re written product individual term probabilities probability presence absence term relevant non relevant documents formula uses probability presence term relevant documents terms common query document probability constant absence term relevant documents terms query absent document 
denotes denotes ranking reduces query add transform ranking formula terms document different assumptions estimation yield different document ranking functions 
croft harper assume query terms constant ignored ranking purposes 
assume documents collection non relevant query close truth collections large estimate function collection size number documents contain term 
yields scoring similar inverse document frequency function discussed section 
notice think weight term document formulation similar similarity formulation vector space model section query terms assigned unit weight 
inference network model model document retrieval modeled inference process inference network 
techniques ir systems implemented model 
simplest implementation model document instantiates term certain strength credit multiple terms accumulated query compute equivalent numeric score document 
operational perspective strength instantiation term document considered weight term document document ranking simplest form model similar ranking vector space model probabilistic models described 
strength instantiation term document defined model formulation 
depicts term contained implementation operational ir systems inverted list data structure 
enables fast access list documents contain term information example weight term document relative positions term document 
typical inverted list may stored 
stores information 
models described implemented inverted lists 
inverted lists exploit fact user query ir systems interested scoring small number documents contain query term 
allows system score documents non zero numeric score 
systems maintain scores documents heap similar data structure processing return top scoring documents query 
documents indexed terms contain process generating building storing document representations called indexing resulting inverted files called inverted index 
ir systems single words terms 
words considered non informative function words 
called words ignored 
various forms word root form called stemming ir jargon systems 
main idea stemming users searching information interested articles information retrieve retrieved retrieving retriever 
system susceptible errors due poor stemming 
example user interested information retrieval get article titled information golden due stemming 
stemmers various languages developed years set stemming rules 
usefulness stemming improved search quality questioned research community especially english 
consensus english average stemming yields small improvements search effectiveness cases causes poor retrieval user considerably annoyed 
stemming possibly beneficial languages word inflections german 
ir systems multi word phrases information retrieval index terms 
phrases considered meaningful individual words phrase match document considered informative single word matches 
techniques generate list phrases explored 
range fully linguistic parsing sentences fully statistical counting word cooccurrences 
accepted ir research community phrases valuable indexing units yield improved search effectiveness 
style phrase generation critical 
studies comparing linguistic phrases statistical phrases failed show difference retrieval performance 
evaluation objective evaluation search effectiveness cornerstone ir 
progress field critically depends experimenting new ideas evaluating effects ideas especially experimental nature field 
early years evident researchers community objective evaluation search techniques play key role field 
cranfield tests conducted established desired set characteristics retrieval system 
debate years desired properties accepted research community measurement search effectiveness recall proportion relevant documents retrieved system precision proportion retrieved documents relevant accepted ir system retrieve relevant documents possible high recall retrieve non relevant documents high precision 
unfortunately goals proven quite contradictory years 
techniques tend improve recall tend hurt precision vice versa 
recall precision set oriented measures notion ranked retrieval 
researchers variants recall precision evaluate ranked retrieval 
example system designers feel precision important users precision top documents evaluation metric 
hand recall important users measure precision say recall indicate non relevant documents user read order find half relevant ones 
measure deserves special mention average precision single valued measure commonly ir research community evaluate ranked retrieval 
average precision computed measuring precision different recall points say averaging 
key techniques section described different ir models implemented inverted lists 
critical piece information needed document ranking models term weight document 
large body gone proper estimation weights different models 
technique shown effective improving document ranking query modification relevance feedback 
state art ranking system uses effective weighting scheme combination query expansion technique 
term weighting various methods weighting terms developed field 
weighting methods developed probabilistic models rely heavily better estimation various probabilities 
methods developed tf term frequency document qtf term frequency query total number documents collection df number documents contain term dl document length bytes avdl average document length okapi weighting document score usually constants 
pivoted normalization weighting document score constant usually 
table modern document scoring schemes vector space model researchers experience systems large scale experimentation 
models main factors come play final term weight formulation 
term frequency tf words repeat multiple times document considered salient 
term weights tf vector space model 
document frequency words appear documents considered common indicative document content 
weighting method called inverse document frequency idf weighting proposed sparck jones early 
document length collections documents varying lengths longer documents tend score higher contain words word repetitions 
effect usually compensated normalizing document lengths term weighting method 
trec vector space model probabilistic models developed term weighting schemes shown effective small test collections available 
inception trec provided ir researchers large varied test collections allowing rapid development effective weighting schemes 
soon trec researchers cornell university realized raw tf terms non optimal frequency logarithmic tf function better weighting metric 
subsequent years effective term weighting scheme developed probabilistic model steve robertson team city university london 
motivated part robertson researchers cornell university developed better models document length factored term weights 
rapid advancement term weighting field widely weighting methods called okapi weighting robertson second called pivoted normalization weighting done cornell university 
research groups trec currently variant weightings 
studies phrase tf idf weighting refer term weighting method uses tf idf differentiate simple document scoring method state ofthe art scoring method ones shown table 
studies claim proposed methods far superior tf idf weighting wrong poor weighting formulation 
query modification early years ir researchers realized quite hard users formulate effective search requests 
thought adding synonyms query words query improve search effectiveness 
early research ir relied thesaurus find synonyms quite expensive obtain general purpose thesaurus 
researchers developed techniques automatically generate thesauri query modification 
automatic methods analyzing word cooccurrence documents produces list strongly related words 
query augmentation techniques automatically generated limited success improving search effectiveness 
main reason lack query context augmentation process 
words related query word meaningful context query 
machine alternative word engine augmentation meaningful query engine 
rocchio proposed relevance feedback query modification 
relevance feedback motivated fact easy users judge documents relevant non relevant query 
relevance judgments system automatically generate better query adding related new terms searching 
general user asked judge relevance top documents retrieved system 
judgments system modifies query issues new query finding relevant documents collection 
relevance feedback shown quite effectively test collections 
new techniques meaningful query expansion absence user feedback developed early 
notable pseudo feedback variant relevance feedback 
top documents retrieved ir system general query topic selecting related terms documents yield useful new terms irrespective document relevance 
pseudo feedback ir system assumes top documents retrieved initial user query relevant relevance feedback generate new query 
expanded new query rank documents presentation user 
pseudo feedback shown effective technique especially short user queries 
techniques applications techniques developed years met varying success 
cluster hypothesis states documents cluster similar similar relevance profile query 
document clustering techniques active area research 
usefulness document clustering improved search effectiveness efficiency limited document clustering allowed developments ir browsing search interfaces 
natural language processing nlp proposed tool enhance retrieval effectiveness limited success 
document ranking critical application ir definitely 
field developed techniques attack different problems information filtering topic detection tracking tdt speech retrieval cross language retrieval question answering 
summing field information retrieval come long way years enabled easier faster information discovery 
early years doubts raised regarding simple statistical techniques field 
task finding information statistical techniques proven effective ones far 
techniques developed field areas yielded new technologies people everyday basis web search engines junk email filters news clipping services 
going forward field attacking critical problems users face todays information world 
exponential growth amount information available information retrieval play increasingly important role
