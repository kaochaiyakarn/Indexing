ballot distribution voter contacts ballot distributor get ballot election 
ballot distributor returns requested ballot election public key election operational configuration servers keys servers locations signed election commissioner 
done steps voter contacts ballot distributor provides id receive list elections participate 
voter chooses election requests ballot ballot distributor 

revs ballot distribution ballot signing 

ballot signing expressing ballot voter commits ballot random bit string generates digest committed ballot 
generates random blinding factor applies digest sends result subset administrators signing 
voter module save answers bit commitment blinding factor non volatile storage preferably provided mobile media 
enables voter resume participation election may affect voter privacy 
administrator receiving request signing verifies signed blind digest requesting voter election 
signs saves signature signed returns previously saved data digest blind signature 
receiving signature voter removes blinding factor verifies correctness original ballot digest administrator public key 
process repeated required number signatures collected 
note blinding factor administrators link signed ballots signatures provided blind ballot digests 

ballot submission step voter constructs ballot submission package joining ballot signatures bit commitment 
time voter save data secure mobile storage

problems detected internet voting system revs subjected distinct classes attacks external internal 
external attacks ones targeting protocol entities may corrupt protocol properties os network denial service iis buffer overflow 
hand internal attacks target directly protocol trying take advantage protocol vulnerability 
external attacks common may detected monitoring mechanisms idss intrusion detection systems 
respect internal attacks problem serious way report detect 
detected vulnerabilities current revs protocol lead internal attacks 
section describes vulnerabilities problems may create 
interference malicious administrators defective administrator fails follow protocol 
may happen fail server ii server deliberately fails follow protocol 
call faulty administrator second malicious administrator 
threshold parameter revs protocol controls different properties voting process degree fault tolerance ii collusion administrators necessary impersonate voters 
increasing decreases fault tolerance number allowed faulty administrators 
hand increasing increases tolerance impersonation voters malicious administrators get signatures producing valid vote 
example administrators protocol tolerates simultaneous faulty administrators servers cooperate generate valid vote voter 
malicious administrator behave faulty notice leading denial service scenarios 
ballot signing phase revs protocol administrator answer voter garbage correct blind signature 
voter detect problem checking returned signature way prove third party administrator misbehaved maliciously 
administrator maliciously selectively deny service selected voters affected voters looks faulty server 
means malicious administrators need prevent voter voting returning false signatures 
recalling example malicious administrators need prevent voters voting 
increasing worse fewer administrators needed 
order prevent malicious administrators act faulty ones necessary allow independent third parties control correctness administrators replies 
assuming revs implementation supervision authorities may inspect interactions voters administrators order detect simpler denial service attempts responding voters returning false error messages 
vote submission revs votes submitted anonymously encrypted protocols servers 
valid votes may repeatedly submitted fault tolerance reasons 
note votes won counted duplicate bit commitment vote unique 
counters check correctness submissions election decryption key disclosed 
servers prevent authorized voter international conference applied computing submit garbage 
consequently counters may overflow useless data dropped election eventually leading denial service scenarios 
possibility reducing risk allow submissions authorized voters 
access control done carefully counters authenticate voters link voters votes 
counters able check correctness votes submitted anonymously 
achieved adding votes anonymous authentication credential authorized voters get 

proposed solutions general solution problems previously authenticate data digital signatures 
voters sign data send administrators counters 
way administrators forge voter requests counters check data sent authorized voter 
critical aspect management key pairs signing validating voter requests 
validating keys ensure correctness 
additionally certification ensure anonymity voters interact counters 
decided extend functionality administrators order certificate voters public keys 
certification different standard certification provided ordinary public key infrastructures 
public keys certified administrators ii certification protocol may involve exchange normal blind signatures 
new threshold parameter theory independent allows controlling separately tolerance faulty servers tolerance malicious servers attempting denial service voters 
double signing authentication previously referred modified blind signing phase revs order authenticate voter requests digital signatures 
administrators forge voter requests order reply garbage preventing voting 
describes process explained detail 

double signing authentication voter generates pair asymmetric keys 
certifies key signature administrators 
process repeated times wants 
acquiring required signatures protocol similar revs 
voter sends blinded digest committed ballot signing signed 
message goes certificate key administrators signatures 
administrator signs voter blinded digest signatures correct supervision authority verify correctness decision 
likewise incorrect reply administrator detected supervision authority

solution analysis internet voting improving resistance malicious servers revs solution modifying ballot signing part protocol 
influence accuracy property required validation votes administrators signatures 
authentication process maintained democracy remains unchanged 
blind signature mechanism assures verifiability privacy properties compromised changes protocol 
resume ability guaranteed key certification process idempotent ii voter resuming voting process may different signed vote 
resistance defective servers collusion resistance depends threshold parameters parameter controls degree collusion necessary impersonation voters administrators 
second parameter controls degree collusion administrators preventing voters voting 
lowest value controls system tolerance malicious administrators attempting interfere voting process 
contrary highest value controls system tolerance faulty administrators 
value controls system resistance defective administrators 
vote validation modified ballot submission phase revs order authenticate submission packages digital signatures 
way authorized voters may generate signatures interact successfully counters 
propose solution similar previously signing voter requests sent administrators described section 
submission package signed voter private key corresponding public key certified administrator blind signatures 
blind signatures prevent counters cooperating administrators order link votes voters 
authorized voters get required blind certificate authorized voters may successfully interact anonymizer counters 
key pair authenticating votes different key pairs authenticating voter requests administrators 
administrators easily link votes voters checking results publicly counters elections 
optimizing protocol certificates blind certificate referred section obtained simultaneously 
note solution prevent authorized voters submitting correctly signed random data 
behavior detected keeping extra state counters auditing systems administrators 
counters store blind certificates order filter different submissions certificate malicious voters forced require blind certificates administrators 
way reveal potentially malicious attempts easily identified election authorities interaction administrators requires identification voters 
possibility allow administrators proper supervision slow blind voters requiring
