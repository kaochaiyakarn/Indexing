goal directed diffusion establish efficient communication sources sinks 
directed diffusion consists elements 
data named attribute value pairs 
sensing task subtask thereof disseminated sensor network interest named data 
dissemination sets gradients network designed draw events data matching interest 
events start flowing originators interests multiple paths 
sensor network reinforces small number paths 
illustrates elements 
describe elements diffusion take simple example sensor network designed tracking animals wilderness 
suppose user network track movement animals remote sub region park 
directed diffusion tracking task represents interest 
interest list attribute value pairs describe task task specific naming scheme 
intuitively attributes describe data desired specifying sensor types geographic region 
identify contact relevant sensors 
term sink denote node originates interest 
interest propagated neighbor neighbor sensor nodes specified region 
key feature directed diffusion sensor node task aware mean nodes store interpret interests simply forwarding 
example sensor node receives interest remembers neighbor neighbors sent interest 
neighbor sets gradient 
gradient represents direction data matching interest flows status demand active inactive possibly desired update rate 
subsequent setting gradient sensor node redistributes interest neighbors 
node floods interest neighbors send subset neighbors direction specified region 
sensor node matches interest activates local sensors collecting data 
prior node sensing circuitry operates low power mode 
sensor node generates data messages matching interest 
directed diffusion data represented attribute value pair naming scheme 
sensor node generates event description termed source 
source sends data message neighbors gradients matching interest 
sink node receives message checks received identical message purpose node maintains small cache received data items 
cache serves avoid duplicates prevent loops preferentially forward interests 
key capability directed diffusion 
identical data item exists cache node drops message 
node triggers application specific filters sophisticated processing 
application specific network processing key feature diffusion network aggregation reduce data transferred network conserve energy 
data item exist cache node determines matching interest resends data gradient neighbor 
sink multiple neighbors chooses receive subsequent data messages interest preferred neighbor example delivered copy data message 
sink reinforces preferred neighbor turn reinforces preferred upstream neighbor

third nodes need globally unique identifiers globally unique addresses 
nodes need distinguish neighbors 
individual nodes cache aggregate generally process messages possible perform coordinated sensing close sensed phenomena 
possible perform network data reduction resulting significant energy savings 
data aggregation directed diffusion sensors detect phenomena generated events disseminated users 
intermediate nodes may aggregate events single event reduce transmissions total data size system resource savings 
total size reduction mainly depends data characteristics event representations applications 
data aggregation leads total size reduction considered justified 
furthermore data aggregation reduce transmissions 
result total transmission overhead packet headers mac control packets reduced energy savings evident 
similar data compression data aggregation classified approaches lossless lossy 
lossless aggregation detailed information preserved 
information theory total size reduction upper bounded entropy measure information encoded message 
basic principle data reduction eliminate redundant information 
events may highly correlated significant amount redundancy 
lossless aggregation lossy aggregation may discard detailed information degrade data quality energy savings

directed diffusion mechanisms adjusted achieve benefit data aggregation 
expected proper interactions data aggregation rules reinforcement rules energy efficient paths selected low delay paths 
particular aggregated data distinguishable non aggregated data possible design reinforcement rules favor aggregated data paths non aggregated data paths 
rules encourage path sharing achieve energy saving due data aggregation see section 
energy savings data aggregation depend reduction total data size 
total data size rarely reduced aggregation shortest path energy efficient aggregated data path 
reasonable reduction total data size aggregated data paths introduce traffic concentration probably congestion adversely impacts network lifetime 
scenario path optimization worth performing 
conversely total data size dramatically reduced aggregation reasonable trade delay energy efficiency favoring longer aggregated data paths shorter non aggregated data paths 
gradient map data gradients sources sinks similar greedy tree preferred 
specifically aggregation points need carefully selected reinforcement additional dissipated energy due longer paths exceed energy savings due total data size reduction
