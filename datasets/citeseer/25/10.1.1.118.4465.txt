important system 
empirical studies show interactive slider interfaces improve efficiency accuracy accessing databases considerably 
equally important possibility getting immediate feedback modified query 
playing system user may learn data issuing hundreds queries 
new query paradigm today database systems queries specified fashion 
adequate user database exactly specifies desired data accesses clearly separated data set 
application areas databases regular basis accounting reservation systems queries keys accessing exactly desired data 
example person deposits money specific account transactions specific account searched resulting data set clearly separated query general sufficient get desired data 
application areas especially large data volumes scientific engineering environmental databases difficult find desired data 
problems occur database contains data different user expects user know exactly look 
case querying database inexact search 
query provide desired result usually database queried similar query differing just detail 
searching desired data similar queries issued user able find desired result 
problems querying database arise user know database system data model query language schema database 
user perfect knowledge domains queries completely correct syntactically semantically queries may results correspond user intentions 
reason user know specific data database
