log structured file systems lfs offer different solution meta data update problem 
conventional update place file system logstructured file systems write modified data data blocks meta data segmented log 
writes log performed large segment sized chunks 
carefully ordering blocks segment lfs guarantees ordering properties ensured update meta data reliably 
unfortunately may possible write related meta data single disk transfer 
case necessary lfs sure recover file system consistent state 
original lfs implementation solved problem adding small log entries segments applying logging approach problem :10.1.1.117.5365
implementation lfs simple transaction interface segments temporary meta data necessary ensure recoverability file system disk 
lfs utilizes combination soft updates journaling approaches 
soft updates ensures blocks written disk particular order journaling takes advantage sequential log writes log recovery 
soft updates section provides brief description soft updates detail publications :10.1.1.11.5338
conventional ffs uses synchronous writes ensure proper ordering meta data writes soft updates uses delayed writes write back caching meta data maintains dependency information specifies order data written disk 
meta data blocks contain pointers cyclic dependencies occur frequently dependencies recorded block level 
example consider file creation file deletion file names directory block inodes inode block 
proper ordering dictates newly created inode written directory block directory block written deleted inode single ordering blocks correct cases 
order eliminate cyclic dependencies soft updates tracks dependencies pointer basis basis 
block system list meta data dependencies associated block 
system may algorithm wants select order blocks written 
system selects block written allows soft updates code review list dependencies associated block 
dependencies require blocks written metadata current block written disk parts meta data current block rolled back earlier safe state 
needed rollbacks completed initially selected block written disk 
write completed system deletes dependencies fulfilled write 
restores rolled back values current value subsequent accesses block see date value 
dependency required rollbacks allow system break dependency cycles 
soft updates applications see copies meta data blocks disk sees copies consistent contents 
soft updates rollback operations may cause writes minimally required integrity ignored 
specifically update dependency causes rollback contents inode directory block write operation roll value forward write completes 
effect doing roll forward immediately block dirty 
changes block written disk roll forward generated extra write operation occurred 
minimize frequency extra writes task cache reclamation algorithms attempt write dirty blocks cache order minimizes number rollbacks 
soft updates meta data write operations asynchronous able defer cases 
particular delete issued soft updates removes file name directory hierarchy creates remove dependency associated buffer holding corresponding directory data 
buffer written delete dependencies associated buffer passed separate background task walking inode indirect blocks freeing associated file data blocks 
background deletion typically occurs seconds system call triggered file deletion 
soft updates system crashes inconsistencies appear disk blocks inodes marked allocated free
