observation designers create site visualizations different levels detail inspired offer similar range options denim 
introduced zooming allow multiple visualizations site preserving unified context iteratively refine site design 
sketching designers interviewed sketch pen regular part design process eventually computerized tools 
designers relatively long periods transferring electronic media merely quick sketches scrap computer tools realize ideas 
worth noting hand sketched versions observed basically document types described including site maps storyboards individual pages 
papers chi april designers said sketch order ideas tools photoshop create formal precise versions 
said sketching try different things explore space possibilities effectively sketching computer tools early parts process 
reasons designers switch sketching computer tools 
quote designer highlights common reason step ll soon feel going doing design revisions ll move electronic tool easier changes things 
ability incrementally modify documents advantages electronic media pen include ease replication distribution 
electronic tools offer ability designers express precisely greater level detail sketching precision desirable process basic ideas worked 
reason switching formal representations need share design ideas outside immediate design team especially clients 
cases designers expressed concern tendency formal representations early unfinished ideas cause viewers focus inappropriate details 
example designer may wish obtain feedback navigational flow particular user interaction 
designers reported clients designers tend focus details color typography set high fidelity mock ups trouble focusing larger concepts 
strike balance need professional representations desire constrain feedback relevant aspects current state design designers medium fidelity representations schematics represent web pages 
representations attractive graphical details confuse mislead viewers 
fact designers sketch part design process supports hypothesis find sketch tool familiar 
indicated find switching electronic media earlier 
indicates sketch tool meet need currently exists
