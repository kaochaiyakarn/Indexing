general multiple biological mechanisms may map set statistical dependencies hard distinguish basis statistical tests

fusing expression data location data constrained search able consider statistical dependencies expression data consistent physical relationships identified location data 
way location data proves quite complementary expression data help identify network edges directly location data dramatically decreases amount expression data needed discover regulatory networks statistical methods 
genomic location data suggests particular edges algorithms currently modify model prior graphs lacking suggested edges zero weight 
know location data noisy 
relax assumption zero weight modify model prior graphs lacking suggested edges small positive weight 
permissible framework adds extra complication relative weight models lacking suggested edges needs specified presumably degree confidence location data 
values weight high low lead inclusion suggested edges respectively 
additionally possible protein may bind dna impact downstream gene regulation 
location data provides information physical relationships expression data provides information statistical relationships guaranteed agree
