theorem gray encoding shifting result change exactly neighbors point search space 
proof consider arbitrary gray coding 
divide positions continuous blocks equal size starting position 
block contains exactly positions see 
consider arbitrary block arbitrary position exactly neighbors contained periodicity binary gray bit encodings ensures neighbors change shifting remaining neighbors contained blocks preceding respectively 
adjacency blocks change shifting neighbors adjacent blocks stay 
remaining neighbors contained blocks adjacent prove rest neighbors change 
consider block contains neighbor fundamental property reflected gray code reflection point exactly halfway pair neighbors 
neighbors outside block contained adjacent blocks reflection points separated positions 
shifting move closer reflection point moved exactly positions farther away reflection point see 
point new neighbor closer reflection point block reflection point location previous neighbor neighbor reflection point exactly impossible neighbors outside block contained adjacent blocks reflection points separated positions
