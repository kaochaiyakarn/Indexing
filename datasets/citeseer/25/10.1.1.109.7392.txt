describes design implementation augmented table interface small group meetings 
system designed multiple users ubiquitous environment people need bring laptop pcs 
effective advantage computer vision implemented concept ubiquitous desktop personal workspace virtual chinese table shared workspace 
user share personalize files drag dropping icons shared workspace 
system provides capabilities interactive image capturing finger position sharing useful group meetings 
personal computers popular changes occurred style small group meetings 
traditionally documents white boards main elements small meetings 
hand people bring laptop pcs meeting order take notes show presentation slides participants 
addition people download electronic files pdf documents internet meeting 
participants may copy files pc file transfer tools ftp 
digitally enhanced meetings succeeded introducing efficiency feel little 
example laptop pcs brought participants require relatively large area space assigned participant meeting table 
little space remains place objects documents hard participants write memos notebooks 
exchanging electronic files people need know ip address computer files downloaded connection computer copy files pcs

hand research conducted realize ubiquitous computing environment proposed mark weiser 
ubiquitous environment large number computers embedded environment support users activity implicitly explicitly enabling communication 
environments established users need carry laptop pcs heavy contain important data 
users data stored network file servers safe place retrieved necessary 
expected environment recognize user position show appropriate information appropriate position 
traditional interaction framework gui uses keyboard mouse standard input devices appropriate ubiquitous environment 
perceptual user interface pui utilizes recognition technologies image recognition speech recognition focused generation interaction framework 
describes design augmented table system ubiquitous augmented environment implementation 
system aims support effective face face meeting allowing users natural intuitive operation digital files 
meeting ubiquitous augmented environment date augmented systems developed :10.1.1.75.9026
designed single user sharing screen multiple users 
hand interest integrating user personal workspace shared workspace screen 
key features system follows 
integrating ubiquitous personal workspaces shared workspace ubiquitous environment imagine user need carry heavy laptop pcs contain important files 
user puts object mobile phone identifies table system identifies user displays desktop personal files stored networked file server user position 
user directly manipulates displayed objects hand fingers mouse 
center table special shared workspace projected 
user drags personal file workspace shared workspace file shared file 
users copy shared file just drag dropping file shared workspace personal workspaces 
shared workspace serves presentation screen user previews particular file describe 
enhancing documents vision augmented reality described documents digital documents exist time 
documents easier carry easier read easier add notes 
difficult copies send people quickly 
effective advantages vision augmented reality implemented features enhance documents 
interactive image capturing 
user digitized image part document just showing rectangle gesture 
finger position sharing 
users enable finger position sharing mode user finger position projected document 
order explore interaction framework described developed augmented table system named allows parallel interactions multiple users fig 
system uses normal white table screen interaction space 
important features system feature essential support meeting ability allow parallel interaction multiple users 
traditional touch panel systems allow multiple interaction 
touch panel systems detect multiple pointing allow users put objects mug cups panel 
difficult expensive larger table 
contrary system naturally allows multiple interaction extended accommodate larger displays 
personal workspace ubiquitous desktop user sits table put mobile phone table system recognizes mobile phone identifies user 
automatically projects user personal workspace mobile phone topleft top right corner workspace 
meeting systems embedded displays users sit want projection coordinate decided position mobile phone

shared workspace plays role presentation screen 
user drags drops image file preview icon file magnified shared workspace users see rotate image fig 

traditional presentation screen user wants point presentation slide needs stand go presentation screen 
hand users system point slide leaving seats 
users see slide right angle simultaneously 
interactive image capturing current meetings want digitize part document send participants meeting 
order current meetings need go pc connected image scanner scan file send attachment file 
time consuming task 
hand system provides interactive image capturing 
user rectangle thumb pointing index finger hands waits seconds ccd camera ceiling zooms rectangle area saves image jpeg format fig

finger position sharing user enables finger position sharing mode grid shown personal workspace 
user aligns document grid users finger positions projected document fig

system finds model histogram close object histogram object regarded matched model 
finger recognition detect hand regions system calculates difference initial image current image tabletop 
binarization operation objects larger threshold recognized hand regions 
hand regions cross edge image system investigates pixel edges determines direction finger tips 
hand regions detected certain area fingertips recognized palm 
repeating shrink operation palm region final pixel determined center palm 
template matching circle template system finds fingertips 
currently system detect track hands frame sec 
cpu faster system track hands faster 
detecting hands table necessary decide hand belongs 
system currently uses distance identified object center gravity hand region center palm 

center gravity hand region personal workspace hand recognized owner personal workspace 

center palm personal workspace hand recognized owner personal workspace 
reason need rule center palm goes outside personal workspace user moves hand shared workspace 
discussion experimental laboratory demonstrations visitors people want system real meetings 
reason natural intuitive interface exchanging digital files 
particular users preferred virtual chinese table 
people claimed unnatural fingers meeting usually hold pen 
better pen finger manipulate digital objects seen tablet pcs 
second reason people felt closer meeting physical fence barrier lcd displays laptop pcs users 
current meetings know users doing barriers 
nice keep privacy interferes mutual understanding 
color information mobile phones identify users 
object recognition system gave correct answers different images experiment 
number users small phones different appearances identification works 
number users larger phones similar appearance identification system fail 
better identification alternative methods rfid tag
