mathematical models infer genes network nowadays struggle overcome main problems determining direction edges deciding relation genes direct 
problems mainly arise due difficulty obtaining reliable data large quantities 
addition prior knowledge models promising way trying overcome microarray data flaws 
analysis behavior bayesian network model non parametric regression bayesian information criterion presence prior knowledge 
despite small number available samples train model results encouraging 
experiments showed relations regulation effective information causal relations 
furthermore correctness informed edges major impact results informing incorrect edges produced worse results obtained prior knowledge
