wordnet wordnet lexical database unique meaning word represented synonym set synset 
synset gloss defines concept represents 
example words car auto automobile constitute single synset gloss wheel motor vehicle usually propelled internal combustion engine 
glosses examples usages associated needs car get synsets connected explicit semantic relations defined wordnet 
relations connect word senses part speech 
noun synsets connected hypernym hyponym meronym holonym relations 
noun synset connected noun synset kind relation said hypernym synset hyponym example synset containing car hypernym synset containing hyponym car 
noun synset connected noun synset part relation said meronym holonym example synset containing accelerator meronym car car holonym accelerator 
noun synset related adjective synset attribute relation value example adjective synset standard value noun synset measure 
taxonomic relations exist verb synsets 
verb synset hypernym verb synset way synset called example verb synset containing word operate hypernym drive drive way operate 
conversely drive operate 
relation verbs analogous hyponym relation nouns henceforth shall term hyponym term 
adjective synsets related similar relation 
example synset containing adjective said similar synset containing adjective dying 
verb adjective synsets related cross see links

measures employed extended gloss overlap measure 
extended gloss overlap measure gloss overlaps introduced lesk perform word sense disambiguation 
lesk algorithm assigns sense target word context comparing glosses various senses words context 
sense target word gloss words common glosses neighboring words chosen appropriate sense 
example consider glosses car tire wheel motor vehicle usually propelled internal combustion engine hoop covers wheel usually rubber filled compressed air 
relationship concepts shown glosses share content word wheel 
share content words gloss tree tall perennial woody plant having main trunk branches forming distinct elevated crown 
original lesk algorithm considers overlaps glosses target word surround context 
significant limitation dictionary glosses tend fairly short provide sufficient vocabulary fine grained distinctions relatedness 
example average length gloss wordnet just words 
extended gloss overlap measure expands glosses words compared include glosses concepts known related concepts compared 
measure takes input concepts represented wordnet synsets outputs numeric value quantifies degree semantic relatedness 
sections follow describe foundations measure computed 
glosses related senses fundamental premises original lesk algorithm 
words appear sentence related senses 
second relevant measure degree senses related identified number overlaps glosses 
words related senses words glosses share 
wordnet provides explicit semantic relations synsets part links 
links cover possible relations synsets 
example wordnet encodes direct link synsets car tire clearly related 
observe glosses synsets words common 
similar lesk premise assert overlaps provide evidence implicit relation synsets 
relation conclude synsets explicitly related car related synsets explicitly related tire 
example conclude synset vehicle hypernym synset car related synset hoop hypernym synset tire 
measure combines advantages gloss overlaps structure concept hierarchy create extended view relatedness synsets 
base measure idea extended set comparisons 
measuring relatedness input synsets look overlaps glosses synsets glosses hypernym hyponym meronym holonym synsets input synsets synsets related input synsets relations attribute similar see 
relations equally helpful optimum choice relations comparisons possibly dependent application overlaps measure employed 
section compares relative efficacy relations measure relatedness applied task word sense disambiguation 
scoring mechanism introduce novel way finding scoring overlaps glosses 
original lesk algorithm compares glosses pair concepts computes score counting number words shared 
scoring mechanism differentiate single word phrasal overlaps effectively treats gloss bag words 
example assigns score concepts drawing glosses specially prepared drafting art transferring designs specially prepared wood glass metal surface 
words overlap word phrase specially prepared 
zipfian relationship zipf lengths phrases frequencies large corpus text 
longer phrase occur multiple times corpus 
phrasal word overlap rarer occurrence single word overlap 
assign word overlap score gives word overlap score greater sum scores assigned words occurred phrases words long 
gloss pair assign overlap score specially prepared score leading total score 
note overlap word phrase specially prepared score 
overlap detection scoring mechanism formally defined follows comparing glosses define overlap longest sequence consecutive words occurs glosses word function word pronoun preposition article conjunction 
overlaps longest length overlap occurs earliest string compared reported 
strings longest overlap detected removed place unique marker placed input strings 
strings obtained checked overlaps process continues longer overlaps 
sizes overlaps squared added arrive score pair glosses 
computing relatedness extended gloss overlap measure computes relatedness input synsets comparing glosses synsets related explicit rela tions provided wordnet
