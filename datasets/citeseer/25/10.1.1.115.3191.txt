important performance metric routing protocol convergence time time required reroute packets failure 
significant studies convergence bgp carried measurements internet 
studies showed convergence bgp slow measured tens seconds 
slow convergence caused factors inherent utilization path vectors bgp due implementation choices 
short slow convergence mainly rooted fact global internet single link failure force bgp routers exchange large amounts bgp advertisements exploring alternative paths affected destinations 
process referred path exploration 
bgp convergence routers may need exchange advertisements concerning prefix 
avoid storms bgp advertisements bgp routers timer called minimum route advertisement interval recommended default value timer prevents bgp routers sending new advertisement prefix previous advertisement prefix sent earlier 
reduces number bgp advertisements exchanged may cause important bgp advertisements unnecessarily delayed 
griffin showed arbitrary value huge impact bgp convergence time

optimal value significantly reduce convergence time bgp 
unfortunately extremely hard find practice varies network network 
cope flapping routers regularly advertise shortly withdraw routes routers implement bgp route flap damping 
technique works ignoring routes change 
necessary avoid storms advertisements due flapping routers unfortunately increases bgp convergence time 
authors proposed modifications reduce bgp convergence time case failures 
ghost flushing approach proposed improves bgp convergence ensuring messages indicating bad news distributed quickly bgp routers news propagates slowly

discussion issues 
robustness bgp sessions exchange messages bgp routers supported tcp connection supplies reliable transport layer communication routers 
despite reliability previous studies showed resilience bgp sessions affected congestion 
labovitz observed keepalive messages delayed periods peak network usage

main need differentiate routing protocol messages normal data traffic 
reason operational operators prioritize bgp messages setting ip precedence

unfortunately community remains cautious upgrading tcp 
furthermore robustness bgp sessions important issue security reasons 
bgp session fail tcp connection fails due attack 
addressed section 
security issues issues article probably capturing attention security 
reason concern operators vulnerabilities bgp may cause large disruptions service possible attacks 
main types security issues exist current interdomain routing architecture bgp protocol 
type security issues possible attacks transmission bgp messages legitimate routers 
bgp peers maintain bgp session tcp connection endpoints tcp connection ip addresses port numbers easily determined distant attacker 
furthermore bgp router bgp session corresponding interdomain link remains long bgp messages exchanged tcp connection 
implies tcp connection fails rea ieee network november december son bgp session fails 
attacker exploit weakness sending spoofed tcp rst segments cause tcp connection supporting bgp session fail 
address problem operational solutions possible 
solution authenticate tcp segments carrying bgp messages relying md 
forces bgp peers maintain shared password 
second solution mainly applicable protect ibgp sessions filters border routers ensure spoofed packets local addresses sources reach network 
solutions applicable ensure distant attacker able send spoofed bgp messages inside existing bgp session 
clearly operational tackle root problem devise robust bgp sessions bgp routers 
second type security issues related lack authentication bgp

alternate solutions proposed lower cost securing bgp 
writing solutions cited previous paragraph implemented operational networks 
perspective mainly reasons 
heavyweight deployed unappealing isps 
second standardization advanced 
solutions efficiently balance trade effectiveness cost implement chance deployment 
lack multipath routing bgp router receive multiple advertisements route multiple sources 
instance fig 
router receives advertisements prefix need run bgp decision process fig 
select best path reach destination 
current release bgp selects path best path path places forwarding table 
addition bgp router advertises peers best route knows destination 
typically install forwarding table path prefix choosing shortest path path advertise peers 
behavior introduces important limitations 
routing protocol uses best route load balancing feasible paths presenting path length 
reason vendors implemented support multipath extensions bgp implementations 
despite fact best route advertised peers implementations 
second important limitation 
bgp router advertises best route knows alternative paths filters precisely support construction intricate autonomic routing policies described earlier 
potentially source traffic unknown 
example peer receive advertisement network reachable know prefix reachable 
causes bgp messages received contain subset available paths destination 
pruning behavior inherent bgp introduces limitations current interdomain routing paradigm especially quality service qos traffic engineering te viewpoints 
efforts carried bgp router able advertise multiple routes destination peers 
proposals

routes selected advertised bgp routers entries exist bgp routing tables increasing problem exposed earlier 
transit ibgp issues bgp interdomain routing protocol mainly concerned transmission routes packets ases

border router transit receives packet destination local consult bgp routing table determine bgp hop egress border router inside 
intermediate routers ingress router egress router 
ensure interdomain packet reach bgp hop selected ingress border router transit ensure intermediate routers select hop 
problem discussed early development bgp techniques emerged 
solution proposed encapsulation ingress border router encapsulates interdomain packets inside tunnel egress border router chosen bgp decision process 
time encapsulation suffered major performance drawback difficulty performing encapsulation available routers 
today high routers capable performing encapsulation line rate label switching mpls tunnels 
main advantage encapsulation bgp forwarding table consulted ingress border router interdomain packet inside 
unfortunately common practice pure transit networks

intermediate routers consult bgp forwarding table interdomain packet risk deflection worse routing loops forwarding tables perfectly synchronized bgp convergence route reflectors 
main issue route reflectors con important highlight shortest path necessarily supply best traffic performance 
ieee network november december federations absolutely necessary tremendous scalability supplied large transit ases 
anomalies described occur especially event link router failure pervasive bgp 
question arises guaranteed ibgp configurations remain highly scalable anomaly free time 
limited traffic engineering capabilities current interdomain routing model offers scarce te capabilities number reasons 
bgp designed protocol distribute reachability information 
second exposed earlier inability bgp advertise multiple routes destination limits number quality alternative paths reroute packets failure 
addition limitation bgp terms multipath routing restricts possibilities balancing traffic domains certain setups vendor specific implementations 
second shown previously autonomic management policies limitations expressiveness policies impose strong restrictions ases able control manage flow interdomain traffic 
instance bgp allows flexibly manage outbound traffic exhibits scarce degree control managing balancing traffic enters multiple paths 
words accurately controlling inbound traffic bgp complex task unclear optimally accomplished 
reason lies lack global coordination policies different domains 
path may apply local policies route outbound traffic desired overriding routing advertisement requirement downstream ases

important topic objectives interdomain te drastically vary depending type
