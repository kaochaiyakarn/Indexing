healthcare pervasive computing technology carried center pervasive computing denmark specifically research area pervasive healthcare 
studies medical large danish hospitals close cooperation clinicians participatory design process 
cornerstone development design validation effort workshops clinicians perform role playing games situations prototypes 
hospital studying project patient medical records 
situation going change near hospital contracted major danish software developing deploying system electronic patient record epr integration portal number older computer systems 
contracted epr traditional desktop laptop computers standard keyboard authentication procedures 
organized number applications handle specific domains prescription medicine schemas rays blood samples provides standard window menu navigation graphical user interface environment 
section describe key properties healthcare proposals visions support pervasive computing infrastructure 
shared material clinicians share lot information stored various artifacts 
prominent example medicine schema prescriptions patient medicine schema resource extensively shared physicians responsible prescription nurses responsible giving prescribed medicine patient 
medicine schemas ward patients collected red binder 
red binder extremely central concerning medicine ward experienced clinicians spend considerable amount time looking red binder 
course key motivation contracted epr supposed solve problems finding accessing shared material 
introduces lot new problems 
accessing medical data means accessing computer 
valuable time spent frequent identification authentication keying name password computers locations clinician visits working hours 
secondly valuable time spent computational context task hand finding right patient open proper applications fetching data organizing activities outsider healthcare may chaotic nurses doctors rush seldom sit interrupt frequently pagers phones constantly distract attention 
patient treatment organized managed set defined tasks activities carried known agreed clinicians 
activities may range simple ones fetching glass water patient complex ones determining treatment patient lab results experience talking patient 
activities organized time medicine proper time dealt time permits 
activities high priority immediate treatment patient suffering heart attack 
activities planned advance sending patient rays taken happen randomly fulfilling request patient 
main proposal outlined detail section model activities class objects computing infrastructure lessening gap healthcare tasks done computer 
computational activities help clinicians job maintaining computational state applications specific activity 
allows clinicians swiftly suspend resume pending activities associated computational state patient record data set applications windows user interface communication links mobility striking features medical nomadic nature clinicians desk personal computer seldom sit 
physicians distributed hospital involving walking different departments wards clinics radiology departments activities linked certain rooms presence certain artifacts 
example giving medicine patient done regular hours day requires medicine patient nurse located typically bed patient 
example pouring medicine patient personal medicine tray done medicine room 
clinicians extremely mobile hindered carrying heavy equipment 
rules desktop laptop computers 
activities involve viewing bulky data rays medical records graphs lab results rules small devices pda classes activities simplest ones 
need computers medium sized large screens available clinicians 
denote computers public computers stress personal available patients relatives 
range wall sized displays laptop sized screens mounted near beds pda sized computers clinicians grab put pocket 
utilizing public computers personal computers means person computational activities stored device 
require infrastructure manages stores distributes computational activities 
person activity associated computational activity infrastructure required able provide access person activities swiftly public computer vicinity 
requirement rules authentication procedures fast specifically traditional cumbersome keyboard login username password 
find system proximity authentication interesting light 
user authenticated infrastructure proximity public computer 
achieved person wearing location sensing device active badges similar presenting artifact system finger print reading personal smart card :10.1.1.17.339
challenge devise proximity authentication mechanism easy time meets requirements secure identification authentication users healthcare setting 
mentioned healthcare activities recurring linked certain artifacts places persons 
enables proactive inference activities infrastructure heuristics recurring activities location people artifacts 
course requires infrastructure access real time location information 
tapping source location information advantages enabling inference activities 
instance allows people locate specific persons clinical roles nearest radiologist artifacts lost medicine tray 
interruptions collaboration means interruptions clinical 
coiera points clinicians preferentially turn information decision support computer decision support systems available 
point ad hoc conversations interruptions evil interactive process sharing interpreting information 
poses requirement computing infrastructure allow user able switch computational activities swiftly seamlessly 
allow clinician interrupted activity handle interruption may involve finding patient data applications views simply resume previous activity automatically computational context 
concern clinician accesses list pending activities clearly need user interface element provides access 
denote component activity bar 
activity bar partly inspired windows task bar runs public computer access activities may select activated 
poses requirement high availability switching swiftly seamlessly computational activities requires data embodied activity available minimal delay 
making critical decisions shared material patient records vital material date different users access information 
find rules unreliable networks public computers centralized components infrastructure 
healthcare need access large pieces information rays require high bandwidth 
ad hoc collaboration characteristic aspect medical collaborative nature 
studies show large fraction clinicians time spent discussions 
treating caring patients involves lot different types clinicians physicians nurses secretaries formal division different types clinicians collaboration highly ad hoc demand 
computing infrastructure support collaborative computational activities fundamental building block 
means users able share activities turns working activity allowing hand activities enabling collaborate activity simultaneously 
furthermore infrastructure support communication support collaboration time space 
activity centered computing vision healthcare long tradition computer systems clinician today faced different systems faced wide range functionality
