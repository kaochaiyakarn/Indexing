semistructured data information normally sociated schema contained data called self describing 
forms semi structured data separate schema exists places loose constraints data 
semi structured data emerged important topic study variety reasons 
data sources web treat databases constrained schema

third dealing structured data may helpful view 
semistructured purposes browsing
