design goals nfs designed simplify sharing filesystem resources network non homogeneous machines 
goal provide way making remote files available local programs having modify relink programs 
addition wanted remote file access comparable speed local file access 
design goals nfs machine operating system independence protocols independent unix nfs server supply files different types clients 
protocols simple implemented low machines pc 
crash recovery clients mount remote filesystems different servers important clients servers able recover easily machine crashes network problems 
transparent access want provide system allows programs access remote files exactly way local files special pathname parsing libraries recompiling

unix registered trademark nfs trademark sun microsystems 
unix semantics maintained unix client order transparent access unix machines unix filesystem semantics maintained remote files 
reasonable performance people remote filesystem faster existing networking utilities rcp easier 
design goal nfs fast small local disk scsi interface 
basic design nfs design consists major pieces protocol server side client side 
nfs protocol nfs protocol uses sun remote procedure call rpc mechanism reasons procedure calls simplify programs rpc helps simplify definition organization implementation remote services 
nfs protocol defined terms set procedures arguments results effects 
remote procedure calls synchronous client application blocks server completed call returned results 
rpc easy understand behaves local procedure call 
nfs uses stateless protocol 
parameters procedure call contain information necessary complete call server keep track past requests 
crash recovery easy server crashes client resends nfs requests response received server crash recovery 
client crashes recovery necessary client server 
state maintained server hand recovery harder 
client server need reliably detect crashes 
server needs detect client crashes discard state holding client client detect server crashes rebuild server state 
stateless protocol avoids complex crash recovery 
client just resends requests response received data lost due server crash 
fact client tell difference server crashed recovered server slow 
sun rpc package designed transport independent 
new transport protocols iso plugged rpc implementation affecting higher level protocol code see appendix 
nfs currently uses darpa user datagram protocol udp internet protocol ip transport level 
udp unreliable datagram protocol packets get lost nfs protocol stateless nfs requests idempotent client recover retrying call packet gets 
common nfs procedure parameter structure called file handle fhandle fh provided server client file 
fhandle opaque client looks contents fhandle uses operations done file 
outline nfs protocol procedures 
complete specification see sun network filesystem protocol specification null returns procedure ping server measure round trip time 
lookup name returns fh attr returns new fhandle attributes named file directory 
create name attr returns attr creates new file returns fhandle attributes 
remove name returns status removes file directory 
getattr fh returns attr returns file attributes 
procedure stat call 
setattr fh attr returns attr sets mode uid gid size access time modify time file 
setting size zero truncates file 
read fh offset count returns attr data returns count bytes data file starting offset bytes file 
read returns attributes file 
write fh offset count data returns attr writes count bytes data file offset bytes file 
returns attributes file write takes place 
rename name returns status renames file name directory directory 
link name returns status creates file directory link file name directory 
symlink name string returns status creates symbolic link name directory value string 
server interpret string argument way just saves association new symbolic link file 
readlink fh returns string returns string associated symbolic link file 
mkdir name attr returns fh creates new directory name directory returns new fhandle attributes 
rmdir name returns status removes empty directory name parent directory 
readdir cookie count returns entries returns count bytes directory entries directory 
entry contains file name file id opaque pointer directory entry called cookie 
cookie subsequent readdir calls start reading specific entry directory 
readdir call cookie zero returns entries starting entry directory 
fh returns returns filesystem information block size number free blocks new returned lookup create mkdir procedures take fhandle argument 
remote fhandle root filesystem obtained client rpc mount protocol 
mount protocol takes directory pathname returns fhandle client access permission filesystem contains directory 
reason making separate protocol easier plug new filesystem access checking methods separates operating system dependent aspects protocol 
note mount protocol place unix pathnames passed server 
operating system implementations mount protocol replaced having change nfs protocol 
nfs protocol rpc built top sun external data representation xdr specification xdr defines size byte order alignment basic data types string integer union boolean array 
complex structures built basic xdr data types 
xdr protocols machine language independent easy define 
arguments results rpc procedures defined xdr data definition language looks lot declarations 
data definition language input xdr protocol compiler produces structures xdr translation procedures interpret rpc protocols server side nfs server stateless servicing nfs request commit modified data stable storage returning results 
implication unix servers requests modify filesystem flush modified data disk returning call 
example write request data block modified indirect blocks block containing inode flushed modified 
modification unix necessary server addition generation number inode filesystem id superblock 
extra numbers possible server inode number inode generation number filesystem id fhandle file 
inode generation number necessary server may hand fhandle inode number file removed inode reused 
original fhandle comes back server able tell inode number refers different file 
generation number incremented time inode freed 
client side sun implementation client side provides interface nfs transparent applications 
transparent access remote files method locating remote files change structure path names 
unix remote file access methods pathnames host path host path name remote files 
allow real transparent access existing programs parse pathnames modified 
doing late binding file address decided hostname lookup file address binding filesystem allowing client attach remote filesystem directory mount command 
method advantage client deal hostnames mount time 
allows server limit access filesystems checking client credentials 
disadvantage remote files available client mount done 
transparent access different types filesystems mounted single machine provided new filesystem interface kernel filesystem type supports sets operations virtual filesystem vfs interface defines procedures operate filesystem virtual node vnode interface defines procedures operate individual file filesystem type 
schematic diagram filesystem interface nfs uses 
pc filesystem floppy client server system calls vnode vfs filesystem disk nfs filesystem rpc xdr filesystem interface vfs interface implemented structure contains operations done filesystem 
likewise vnode interface structure contains operations done node file directory filesystem 
vfs structure mounted filesystem kernel vnode structure active node 
data type implementation allows kernel treat filesystems nodes way knowing underlying filesystem implementation 
vnode contains pointer parent vfs pointer mounted vfs 
means node filesystem tree mount point filesystem 
root operation provided vfs return root vnode mounted filesystem 
pathname traversal routines kernel bridge mount points 
root operation keeping pointer root vnode mounted filesystem released 
vfs mounted filesystem contains pointer back vnode mounted pathnames include traversed mount points 
addition vfs vnode operations filesystem type provide mount mount root operations mount normal root filesystems 
operations defined filesystem interface 
arguments results vp pointer vnode pointer directory vnode pointer device vnode 
filesystem operations mount varies system call mount filesystem network server routines rpc xdr system calls vnode vfs mount root mount filesystem root vfs operations vfs filesystem root vfs returns vnode return vnode filesystem root vfs returns return filesystem statistics sync vfs flush delayed write blocks vnode operations open vp flags mark file open close vp flags mark file closed vp uio flags read write file ioctl vp cmd data control operation select vp select getattr vp returns attr return file attributes setattr vp attr set file attributes access vp mode check access permission lookup name returns vp look file name directory create name attr excl mode returns vp create file remove name remove file name directory link vp link file rename name rename file mkdir name attr returns create directory rmdir name remove directory readdir returns entries read directory entries symlink name attr create symbolic link readlink vp returns data read value symbolic link fsync vp flush dirty blocks file inactive vp mark vnode inactive clean vp blk returns map block number strategy bp read write filesystem blocks bread vp returns buf read block vp bp release block buffer notice vnode procedures map nfs protocol procedures unix dependent procedures open close ioctl 
strategy bread procedures reading writing buffer cache 
pathname traversal done kernel breaking path directory components doing lookup call vnode component 
glance waste time pass component call passing path receiving back target vnode 
main reason component path mount point filesystem mount information kept vnode implementation level 
nfs filesystem passing pathnames force server keep track mount points clients order determine break pathname violate server 
inefficiency looking component time alleviated cache directory vnodes 
implementation implementation nfs started march 
step implementation modification kernel include filesystem interface 
june vnode kernel running 
benchmarks test amount overhead added extra interface 
turned cases difference measurable worst case kernel slowed 
adding new interface finding fixing places kernel inodes directly code contained implicit knowledge inodes disk layout 
filesystem routines kernel completely rewritten vnodes 
namei routine pathname lookup changed vnode lookup operation cleaned doesn global state 
routine adds new directory entries create rename fixed depended global state namei 
modified directory locking directory rename operations inode locking longer available level vnodes locked 
avoid having fixed upper limit number active vnode vfs structures added memory allocator kernel structures allocated freed dynamically 
memory allocator kernel rpc implementation 
new system call added read directory entries different types filesystems 
readdir library routine modified programs rewritten

march user level rpc xdr libraries ported user level library kernel able kernel user kernel kernel rpc calls june 
worked rpc performance month round trip time kernel kernel null rpc call milliseconds sun 
performance tuning included speed ups udp ip code kernel 
rpc vnode kernel place implementation nfs simply matter writing xdr routines nfs protocol implementing rpc server nfs procedures kernel implementing filesystem interface translates vnode operations nfs remote procedure calls 
nfs kernel running mid august 
point modifications vnode interface allow nfs server synchronous write operations 
necessary unwritten blocks server buffer cache part client state 
implementation mount protocol built nfs protocol 
wasn broke mount protocol separate user level rpc service 
mount server user level daemon started automatically mount request 
checks file exports contains list exported filesystems clients import see appendix 
client import permission mount daemon system call convert pathname imported fhandle returned client 
client side mount command modified take additional arguments including filesystem type options string 
filesystem type allows mount command mount type filesystem 
options string pass optional flags different filesystem types mount time 
example nfs allows flavors mount soft hard 
hard mounted filesystem retry nfs requests forever server goes soft mount gives returns error 
problem soft mounts unix programs checking return status system calls get strange behavior servers go 
hard mounted filesystem hand fail due server crash may cause processes hang data lost 
allow automatic mounting boot time keep track currently mounted filesystems file formats changed common ascii format similar format berkeley addition type options field 
type field specify filesystem type nfs pc options field comma separated list option strings rw hard see appendix 
addition mount server added nfs server daemons 
user level processes system call kernel return 
provide user context kernel nfs server allows server sleep 
similarly block daemon client side user level process lives kernel services asynchronous block requests 
rpc requests block user context necessary wait read ahead write requests complete 
daemons provide temporary solution problem handling parallel synchronous requests kernel 
hope light weight process mechanism kernel handle requests started nfs sun september spent months working performance enhancements administrative tools nfs easier install 
advantages nfs immediately obvious df output diskless machine access gigabyte disk 
filesystem kbytes avail capacity mounted dev nd dev ndp pub panic usr usr fiat usr src usr src panic usr panic usr panic galaxy usr galaxy usr galaxy mercury usr mercury usr mercury usr usr hard issues hard design issues resolved development nfs 
deciding wanted nfs 
lots flexibility lead lots confusion 
filesystem naming servers export filesystems clients mount sub directory remote filesystem top local filesystem top remote filesystem 
fact remote filesystem mounted mounted copy 
means clients different names filesystems mounting different places 
alleviate confusion set basic mounted filesystems machine users add filesystems top 
remember policy mechanism nfs enforce 
user home directories mounted usr 
may violation goals hostnames part pathnames fact directories called usr usr server names just convenience 
scheme nfs clients look timesharing terminals user log machine home directory 
tilde expansion username expanded user home directory shell network machines 
avoid problems loop detection dynamic filesystem access checking servers cross mount points remote lookup requests 
means order see filesystem layout server client remote mount server exported filesystems 
credentials authentication security nfs uses unix style permission checking server client unix users see little difference remote local files 
rpc allows different authentication parameters plugged message header able nfs unix flavor authenticator pass uid gid groups call 
server uses authentication parameters permission checking user making call doing operation locally 
problem authentication method mapping uid gid user server client 
implies flat uid gid space local network 
acceptable long run working network authentication method allows users login network provide network wide identity user regardless user identity particular machine 
mean time developed rpc service called yellow pages yp provide simple replicated database lookup service letting yp handle hosts passwd group flat uid space easier administer 
issue related client authentication super user access remote files 
clear super user machine root access files server machine nfs 
solve problem server map user root uid user uid checking access permission 
solves problem unfortunately causes strange behavior users logged root root may fewer access rights remote file normal user 
concurrent access file locking nfs support remote file locking 
purposely include part protocol find set file locking facilities agrees correct 
separate rpc file locking facility 
file locking inherently stateful service lock service depends rpc service called status monitor status monitor keeps track state machines network lock server free locked resources crashed machine 
status monitor important stateful services provides common view state network 
related problem file locking concurrent access remote files multiple clients 
local filesystem file modifications locked inode level 
prevents processes writing file data single write 
nfs server maintains locks requests write may span rpc requests clients writing remote file may get intermixed data long writes 
unix open file semantics tried hard nfs client obey unix filesystem semantics modifying server protocol 
cases hard 
example unix allows removal open files 
process open file remove directory entry file name filesystem read write file 
bit unix just going support turns programs didn want fix csh sendmail temporary files 
open file removal remote files check client vfs remove operation file open rename removing 
sort invisible client allows reading writing 
client kernel removes new name vnode inactive 
call solution client crashes rename remove garbage file left server 
entry cron added clean server practice necessary 
problem associated remote open files access permission file change file open 
local case access permission checked file opened remote case permission checked nfs call 
means client program opens file changes permission bits longer read permission subsequent read request fail 
get problem save client credentials file table open time file access requests 
unix open file semantics preserved interactions clients remote file controlled single client 
example client opens file client removes file client read request fail file open 
time skew time skew clients client server cause times associated file inconsistent 
example saves current time library entry ld checks modify time library time saved library 
run remote file modify time comes server current time gets saved library comes client 
server time far ahead client looks ld library date 
programs affected ls emacs fixed 
time skew potential problem program compares system time file modification time 
plan fix limiting time skew machines time synchronization protocol 
performance final hard issue interested performance 
development time nfs spent improving performance 
goal nfs comparable speed small local disk speed interested raw throughput long takes normal 
track improvements set benchmarks include small compile tbl large compile compile bubble sort matrix inversion pipeline 
improve performance nfs implemented usual read ahead write buffer caches client server sides

remote filesystems may ask need nfs locus newcastle connection rfs ibis efs cases answer simple nfs designed handle non homogeneous machines operating systems fast get today 
locus system provides file replication crash recovery remote filesystems similar 
rfs vs nfs remote filesystem rfs demonstrated usenix conferences released provide functionality nfs 
allows clients mount filesystems remote server access files transparent way 
differences stem basic design philosophies 
nfs provides general network service rfs provides distributed unix filesystem difference philosophy shows different areas designs 
networking rfs standard network transport protocols udp ip 
uses special purpose transport protocol published implementations generally available 
protocol easily replaced rfs depends properties transport virtual circuit determine machine crashed 
nfs uses rpc layer hide underlying protocols easy support different transport protocols having change nfs protocols 
rfs remote procedure call mechanism extends semantics unix system calls system call accesses remote file goes network continues execution server 
system call finished results returned client 
protocol complicated fact client server interrupt remote system call 
addition system calls deal filenames modified handle partial lookup server client mount point encountered pathname 
case server looks part name returns control client look rest 
non homogeneous machines operating systems nfs currently runs different vendors hardware berkeley sun os dec ultrix system vms ms dos rfs run system unix systems 
nfs design assumption installations different types machines network machines run widely varying systems 
rfs protocol includes canonical format data help support different machine architectures attempt support operating systems system 
nfs design try predict 
includes flexibility support evolving software hardware protocols 
flexibility rfs built proprietary protocols unix semantics built hard imagine protocols different operating systems 
nfs hand provides flexibility rpc layer 
rpc allows different transport protocols authentication methods server versions supported single implementation 
allows example encrypted authentication method maximum security workstations allowing access pc simpler authentication method 
protocol evolution easier clients servers support different versions rpc protocols simultaneously 
rfs uses streams hide details underlying protocols 
easy plug new transport protocols 
unfortunately rfs uses virtual circuit connection transport protocol detect server client crashes 
means reliable byte stream protocol tcp ip plugged tcp connections go away crashes data flowing time crash 
crash recovery rfs uses stateful protocol 
server maintain information current mount points clients open files directories devices held clients state client requests progress 
difficult costly client rebuild server state server crash rfs server crash recovery 
server client crash detected protocol connection fails point operations progress machine aborted 
rfs server crashes roughly equivalent client point view losing local disk 
server crashes rare events doing recovery acceptable keep mind network delays breaks overloading usually distinguished machine crash 
networks grow possibility network failures increases connectivity network increases chance client server crash 
decided early design process nfs recover gracefully machine network problems 
nfs need crash recovery server server maintains state clients 
similarly client recovers server crash simply resending request 
administration major differences administration nfs rfs 
uid mapping table rfs servers removes need uniform uid user mapping network 
nfs assumes uniform uid space provide yellow pages service distribution central administration system databases passwd group easier 
nfs mount rpc service machine acting server 
exported filesystem information maintained machine available service 
rfs uses centralized name service running machine network keep track advertised filesystems servers 
centralized name service acceptable nfs forces clients servers protocol exchanging mount information 
having separate protocol mount service support different filesystem access checking different operating system dependent features mount operation 
unix semantics nfs support semantics unix filesystems client 
removing open file append mode writes file locking fully implemented nfs 
rfs implement unix filesystem semantics 
server crashes filesystem taken service client applications see error conditions normally happen due disk failure 
error condition severe usually means system failed applications try recover 
availability nfs product year 
source support nfs berkeley bsd available sun mt system associates instruction set 
rfs released
