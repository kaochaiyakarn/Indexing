active xml illustrate power combining xml web services briefly describe active xml consists embedding web service calls xml documents 
section works context active xml project 
active xml short parts data explicitly parts consist calls web services generate data 
architecture 
peer acts client activating web service calls embedded documents 
acts server supporting web services corresponding queries updates repository documents 
xml dialect 
instance document document 
sc elements denote embedded service calls 
document reviews obtained com web site 
information hitchcock movies may obtained com site 
data obtained call web service may viewed intensional originally 
may viewed dynamic sense dynamic web pages 
call possibly returns different date documents called different times 
service call activated data returns inserted document 
documents evolve time consequence service call activations 
particular importance decision activate particular service call 
cases activation decided peer hosting document 
instance peer may decide call service data provides requested user peer may choose refresh data returned call periodic basis say weekly 
cases web service provider may decide send updates client instance registered subscription continuous service 
key aspect approach peers exchange documents document embedded service calls 
highlight essential difference exchange regular xml data data 
frameworks sun jsp php dynamic data supported programming constructs embedded inside documents 
request code evaluated replaced result obtain regular fully materialized html xml document 
active xml documents embed calls distributed information management xml web services web services need materialize service calls sending data 
flexible data exchange paradigm possible sender sends xml document embedded service calls document gives receiver freedom materialize data needed 
conclude section briefly mention issues illustrate novel problems raised approach call call suppose asks information movie 
may choose call com obtain reviews sending data 
decision may guided considerations performance cost access rights security choose activate service call may return document embedded service calls decide activate recursively 
solution implemented negotiation peers determine type data exchange 
leads complex automata manipulation 
general problem deep connections alternating tree automata tree automata alternating universal existential states 
lazy service calls mentioned possible specify call activated data returns may needed answer query 
difficulty decide particular call needed

content section works xyleme project content warehousing spin mdp aspect 
content warehouse 
distributed enterprises generally communities centered common interest produce need share large volumes data reports emails contact addresses documentation contracts web sites 
difficult manage information critical able find desired data timely manner 
suggests organizing information content warehouses 
goal warehouse provide integrated access heterogeneous autonomous distributed sources information 
queries typically serge abiteboul evaluated access original sources 
focus warehouse content qualitative information documents various formats olap line analytical processing warehouses concerned quantitative information typically organized relations 
content warehouse supports construction enrichment monitoring maintenance large repositories information methods access analyze annotate information 
clearly xml obvious candidate represent warehouse information particular meta data warehouse documents formats pdf html doc handled 
furthermore systems soon support web service interfaces web services provide natural infrastructure communications warehouse 
peer peer systems 
possible definitions systems 
mean large varying number computers cooperate solve particular tasks warehousing tasks centralized authority 
words challenge build efficient robust scalable system typically inexpensive unreliable computers distributed wide area network 
context distributed data management popular 
see instance :10.1.1.15.3347:10.1.1.105.8601:10.1.1.19.6221
implementation content warehouse setting may motivated number factors 
instance economic viewpoint system allows share costs reduce advantage existing infrastructures 
setting content warehouse large volume data users take advantage distribution improve performance 
combination concept warehouse centralized access information architecture definition stressing distribution may bit confusing try articulate precisely 
data sources heterogeneous autonomous distributed 
warehouse presents unique entry point information warehouse logically homogeneous centralized 
warehouse implementation concept warehouse distributed peers 
warehouse physically distributed heterogeneous autonomous machines 
note higher level trust may possibly achieved warehouse peers original data sources 
technical viewpoint main issue distributed data management means novel issue 
environment context particular absence central authority number peers hundreds possibly millions change rules game 
typically problems long studied take different flavor 
particular issues need addressed information service discovery ii web crawling iii document ranking queries iv mediation integrating independent ontologies change monitoring
