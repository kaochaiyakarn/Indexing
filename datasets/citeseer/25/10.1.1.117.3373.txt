latent semantic indexing 
order implement latent semantic indexing matrix terms documents constructed :10.1.1.108.8490

practice local global weightings applied increase decrease importance terms documents 
speci cally write aij berry dumais local weighting term document andg global weighting term matrix factored product matrices equation singular value decomposition svd 
svd derives latent semantic structure model orthogonal matrices containing left right singular vectors respectively diagonal matrix singular values matrices re ect breakdown original relationships linearly independent vectors factor values

shaded regions diagonal line represent ak equation 
important lsi method derived ak matrix reconstruct original term document matrix exactly 
truncated svd sense captures important underlying structure association terms documents time removes noise variability inword usage plagues word retrieval methods 
intuitively number dimensions smaller number unique terms minor di erences terminology ignored 
terms occur similar documents example near dimensional factor space occur document 
means documents share words users query may space 
derived representation captures term term associations retrieval 
consider words car automobile driver 
terms car automobile synonyms driver related concept elephant unrelated 
retrieval systems query automobiles retrieve documents cars documents elephants precisely term automobile documents 
preferable query automobiles retrieved articles cars articles drivers lesser extent 
derived dimensional feature space represent useful term inter relationships 
roughly speaking words car automobile occur motor model vehicle chassis sedan engine similar representations space 
contexts driver overlap lesser extent elephant quite dissimilar 
main idea lsi explicitly model interrelationships terms truncated svd exploit improve retrieval
