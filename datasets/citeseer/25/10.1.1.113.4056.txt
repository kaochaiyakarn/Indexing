session rekeying policy defines reaction group changes membership terms rekeying sessions 
application message policy defines security guarantees application messages transmitted 
membership policy dictates availability membership information members 
failure policy defines type failures handled system 
remainder section describes nature implications policy decisions 
antigone assumes group members trusted members actively attempt circumvent security system 
non members may attempt intercept messages modify messages prevent messages delivered 
session rekeying policy common strategy support secure group communication trusted members common symmetric session key 
important policy issue group communication application deciding session old session key discarded new session key sent members 
close relationship session rekeying group membership 
applications need pro tection members current view 
changes group membership require session 
rekeying performed change membership view reflect secure group indicates members actively participating session 
past members may retain session key continue receive content 
members may record decode current past content 
applications need protection past members rekeying membership events unnecessary 
define view group set members current group membership view 
key group set members access current session key 
key group may subset superset overlap view group 
say group security policy said sensitive event changes security context response reception event 
typically security context changed distributing new session key rekeying 
group security policy sensitive group membership events 
group membership events include join event triggered member allowed join group leave events triggered member leaves group process failure events member assumed failed manner member eject events previously admitted member purged group group policy 
addition sessions may specified time interval passed session rekey 
sensitivity policy directly defines threat model 
example consider group model sensitive eject events 
session member ejection key group contain ejected member 
application assured ejected member access content 
session content protected processes left voluntarily assumed failed join 
sensitivity mechanisms antigone build large number session rekeying policies 
text define illustrate general purpose policies representative policies implemented existing systems 
group view set identities associated members group period changes membership occur 
membership changes member joins leaves group new view created 
similar concept group view bir 
time sensitive rekeying policy groups implementing time sensitive policy periodically rekey independent group membership events 
periodic rekeying prevents session key wearing 
group attempts guard cryptanalysis session key limited period 
periodically rekeying group may protected adversary wishes block delivery new session keys 
adversary blocking rekeying messages may intend group continue current session key 
time sensitive rekeying policy new key successfully established current session key expires group members choose longer communicate expired session key 
time sensitive rekeying useful secure online subscription service 
paying members periodically sent new key valid subscription interval 
gkmp hm protocol implements time sensitive rekeying policy 
typically systems implementing time sensitive groups key encrypting keys kek hm reduce costs rekeying 
systems keks key group contains previous current members group 
approach limited member may continue access group content leaving 
systems keks forcibly eject members additional infrastructure 
rekeying antigone session key independent 
session key independence states knowledge session key provides information 
independence antigone provides stronger guarantee time sensitive groups keks member left group may continue access group content rekey 
past member access current group content joining member 
leave sensitive rekeying policy groups implementing leave sensitive policy rekey leave process failure eject events 
key group may arbitrarily larger view group 
threat model implied leave sensitive groups states member left group access current content 
example business conferencing system supports negotiations representatives supplier may benefit leave sensitive rekeying 
supplier leaves leave sensitive rekey policy prevent subsequent discussions available supplier supplier able intercept messages 
io lus mit implements leave sensitive rekeying policy 
join sensitive rekeying policy groups implementing join sensitive policy rekey membership join events 
threat model implied join sensitive groups states member joining group access past content 
join sensitive rekeying policy ensure members left group ejected group able access current session content 
assumption past members trusted interested current content 
practice join sensitive rekeying policy conjunction time sensitive rekeying policy limit duration past members access current session content 
membership sensitive rekeying policy groups implementing membership sensitive policy rekey membership event 
threat model implied membership sensitive groups states group member joining group access past content members left group access current content 
policy combination leave sensitive rekeying 
applications comprehensive security requirements need membership sensitive rekeying policy 
providing strong guarantees message delivery atomicity reliability requires tight controls message content 
tight controls guarantees may circumvented 
rampart rei system provides type membership sensitive service 
rekeying policies applications may require combination policies may different policies depending application state specific attributes event 
business conferencing application example policy may rekey member role supplier leaves member role representative leaves 
allowing policies distinction members may allow application optimize rekeying 
certain circumstances may important group sensitive certain times 
groups may wish sensitivity function group size resource availability 
way group provide strongest security model supported network host infrastructure 
time sensitive rekeying useful combination schemes 
time sensitive rekey ing combination membership sensitive rekeying example helps ensure adversary prevent session rekeying indefinitely detection membership change event 
application message policy application message policy states types security guarantees required application messages 
example application wishing ensure party external group able access content define confidentiality part policy 
common types message security guarantees integrity confidentiality group authenticity sender authenticity 
confidentiality guarantees member outside group may gain access session traffic 
integrity guarantees modification application message detectable receivers 
session key typically obtain guarantees 
guarantees sender authenticity difficult obtain additional security infrastructure 
antigone supports message guarantees 
note single policy need apply message 
applications different messages require different guarantees depending nature message assumed threat model 
membership policy identification membership group session important requirement large class applications 
evidenced number group communication systems achieving strong guarantees availability correctness group membership costly 
providing availability change membership requires distribution new group membership view member 
conversely members class systems need aware group membership 
model typical multicast applications 
environment providing services reliability fault tolerance commonly left application 
membership policy indicates availability group membership information 
policy states group membership supported group view membership information distributed member needed 
antigone provides mechanisms distribute keys membership information primarily allow higher performance applications members need membership information 
currently antigone attempt guarantee confidentiality group membership 
general hiding group membership members non members difficult current networks introducing noise network traffic 
primarily ability intercept messages network allows access source destination packets case unicasts multicast tree case ip multicasts 
mounting traffic analysis attack may deduce close approximation group membership 
process failure policy process failure policy states set failures detected security applied failure detection mechanism 
defining characteristic failure detection mechanism definition fault model 
fault model defines types behavior exhibited faulty process mechanism detect 
typical crash models include fail message omissions timing errors mul 
strongest byzantine failure model faulty process may exhibit behavior whatsoever 
process failure policy may state need secure failure detection 
securing failure detection group may protected masking process failures adversary 
protecting group adversary attempts generate false failures may difficult 
failures may forced blocking communication group participants 
denial service attack difficult address software 
antigone supports detection fail faults group members 
prevent problems due timing errors synchronized clocks timestamps antigone protocols 
mechanisms failure detection time sensitive rekeying antigone rely timeouts individual processes 
process clock progresses incorrect rate may take longer detect failures processes clock progresses slow may mistakenly assume failure clock progresses fast times
