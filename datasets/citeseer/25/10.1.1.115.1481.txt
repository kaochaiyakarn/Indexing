decade seen significant change nature electronic commerce emergence economic software agents rational players capable autonomous flexible actions achieve objectives endowed sophisticated strategies maximising utility profit behalf human owners 
today electronic trading markets allow access information enables software agents informed respond efficiently humans hope 
trading markets governed protocols define rules interaction economic agents
