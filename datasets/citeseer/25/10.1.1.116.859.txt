fuzzy competitive agglomeration ca algorithm automatically cluster data optimal number components 
ca deals object feature data session similarity data relational 
session dissimilarity measure define euclidean 
extend ca non euclidean relational data 
resulting competitive agglomeration relational data card algorithm deal complex subjective distance similarity measures restricted euclidean 
defining similarity user sessions preprocessing segmentation access log data sessions access log entry consists user ip address ii access time iii request method get post iv url page accessed data sion protocol typically vi return code vii number bytes transmitted

analogous individual log entries grouped user sessions :10.1.1.146.4557
user session defined sequence temporally compact accesses user 
web servers typically log usernames define user session accesses ip address duration elapsed time consecutive accesses session prespecified threshold 
url site assigned unique number total number valid urls 
user session encoded dimensional binary attribute vector property user accessed url session ensemble sessions extracted server log file denoted note scheme map user multiple sessions multiple user sessions 
concern attempt extract typical user session profiles 
notion multiple user sessions enable better capture situation user displays different access patterns site 
adaptation session data clustering clustering algorithms object data suitable clustering user sessions high dimensionality space usually urls typical web site 
web sessions complex convert simple numerical features partly organization web site taken account 
fact urls site hierarchical tree structural composition 
define similarity measure sessions incorporates structure site urls involved adopt relational approach clustering data sessions numeric nature 
start considering cosine angle measure similarity problem similarity measure completely ignores hierarchical organization web site adversely affect ability capture correct profiles 
example ses courses cecs sion courses cecs pair courses cecs research session pair receive similarity score similarly expect ses courses cecs projects proj sions similar courses cecs projects courses cecs overlap urls sessions directory hierarchy tree 
leads define similarity measure structural url level computation similarity session level 
provide syntactic model entire web site tree edge connects node url corresponding hierarchically located courses example courses cecs root tree node incoming edges corresponds highest level url web site 
account syntactic representation urls define syntactic similarity urls denotes path traversed root node node corresponding url indicates length path number edges included path 
similarity session level incorporates syntactic url similarities defined correlating url attributes similarities sessions follows similarity uses soft url level similarities 
special case urls accessed session zero similarity urls accessed session reduces sessions identical value simplifies pending number urls accessed 
means similarity measure unintuitive considerably small de ideally similarity maximal identical sessions 
identical sessions similarity generally underestimated session pairs share identical urls rest unshared urls low syntactic similarity 
general sessions syntactic url similarities low provides higher accurate session similarity 
hand syntactic url similarities high higher accurate 
define new similarity sessions takes advantage desirable properties follows purpose relational clustering similarity mapped dissimilarity measure metric distance possible distinct sessions zero dissimilarity 
occurs numerator denominator equal equivalently particularly true url level similarities urls accessed sessions 
typical example consists sessions courses cecs courses cecs html property desirable application consider sessions fit profile 
session dissimilarity measure violates triangular inequality metric distances cases 
instance dissimilarity sessions courses cecs zero 
courses cecs dissimilarity courses cecs courses cecs dissimilarity courses cecs zero courses cecs 
illustrates desirable property profiling sessions dissimilarity stringent accessed urls get farther root amount specificity user accesses increases correspondingly 
proposed dissimilarity measure fits subjective criteria session similarity
