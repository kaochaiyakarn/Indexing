tfrc controlled real time applications interactive video adapt rates available bandwidth employ congestion control 
dual role hosts routers ad hoc networks introduces critical vulnerability congestion control specifically number forwarding behaviors routers ad hoc relay nodes employ severely degrade throughput congestion controlled traffic 
refer behaviors variants jellyfish attack describe follows 
jf reorder attack 
tcp cumulative defines message ack indicate segments received 
consequently receipt duplicate acks infer loss 
duplicate acks indicate order packet receipt tcp number mechanisms increase robustness order packets including tcp sack reorder robust tcp 
tcp variants assume reordering events rare short lived due network events route changes 
contrast consider jf nodes maliciously re order packets 
attack jf deliver packets placing re ordering buffer fifo buffer 
consequently show persistent re ordering packets result near zero goodput despite having transmitted packets delivered 
jf periodic dropping attack 
losses due buffer overflow inevitable congested environments 
knightly show losses occur periodically near retransmission time rto timescale range rto intended address severe congestion throughput nearly zero 
endpoint attack described malicious node transmits periodic pulses network 
rto spaced pulses force flows sharing bottleneck link enter repeated timeout phases attack results flows obtaining near zero throughput attacker low average transmission rate

utilize principle jf periodic dropping attack attacking nodes drop packets short duration tens ms rto 
jf passive generate traffic non malicious nodes jf drop small fraction time dropping pattern maliciously chosen period behavior results 
encountering jf loss duration victim flow enter timeout jf chooses dropping duration sufficiently long result multiple losses 
flow attempts exit timeout rto seconds jf immediately soon periodically drop 
note jf knows flow enters timeout jf induced loss 
jf safely assume rto seconds flow attempting exit fragile slow start state 
jf delay variance attack

ensuring high performance presence random high delay variation due attacker clearly incorporated tcp design 
high delay variation cause tcp send traffic bursts due self clocking leading increased collisions loss ii cause mis estimations available bandwidth delay congestion control protocols tcp westwood vegas iii lead excessively high rto value 
enhancing tcp combat effects non malicious delay variation wireless links focus intense research see example development tools available bandwidth estimation 
consequently malicious manipulation packet delays jf delay variance attack potential significantly reduce tcp throughput

black hole node fails forward packet detected eavesdropping neighbors 
passive pack watchdog protocols designed precisely purpose 
key idea pack exploit broadcast nature wireless medium node sends packet fig 
overhear subsequent transmission neighboring unfortunately pack key limitations preclude general solution attacks 
pack deployed combination dynamic power management

consequently precluding dynamic power management order deploy pack results significant waste energy inhibits spatial reuse 
scenario illustrated

second pack watchdogs implicitly assume attackers omnidirectional antennas 
black hole node uses directional antenna electronically steerable fool upstream node beam forming illustrated 
particular black hole node beam form fake transmission incorrectly infers received packet 
issue increasingly critical technologies widely deployed

case jellyfish attacks protocol compliant quite problematic neighbor detect misbehavior 
example jf periodic dropping attack drop packets rate higher congested node

indicates rushing attack combined dos attacks impact quite devastating 
example attacking nodes able attract twice flows compared achieved uniform graph vs flow goodput drops attackers 
furthermore attacking nodes attract times flows goodput nearly collapses attackers
