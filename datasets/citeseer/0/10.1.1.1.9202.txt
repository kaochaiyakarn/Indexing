conversation typically begins user initiated user chose visit site 
site presents choice hyperlinks user expected selection 
step conversation site initiated clicking ny hyperlink user responding initiative taken website 
link user decide pursue links initiative residing site press back button initiative 
interaction user site exchange initiative called mixed initiative dialog 
mixed initiative interaction studied speech interfaces artificial intelligence planning discourse analysis communities begun investigated web interactions :10.1.1.41.5018

main contributions summarized alongside facets 
interaction interfaces support hyperlink speech modes input allow users employ uniformly multimodal session 
transformation engine uses staging transformations functional approach dialog management specify reason implement web dialogs side effects
