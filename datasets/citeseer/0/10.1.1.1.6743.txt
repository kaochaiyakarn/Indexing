implementation section propose implementation autonomous cinematographer 
developing system considered variety paradigms 
decided early implement reactive system planning 
felt planning system scripted camera motion attempted cover changing scenes probably brittle 
wanted emotion motivation central cinematography system 
difficult integrate planning approach 
wanted employ architecture characters possible leverage done group developing characters 
system takes shot important level understanding cinematography 
shots composed elements actor motion style 
elements turn modified variety settable parameters spring constant controls motion style height lead actor 
behavior system consists main elements sensors emotions motivations actions 
animal sensory information combined motivations modulated emotions fed action selection mechanisms 
sensors able extract information states creatures world 
chooses actions combining data internal state 
uses sensors connections creatures world find emotions feeling determine actions gather knowledge motivational state 
cinematography system somewhat privileged regard order characters effectively screen needs access information internal state actors 
order exchange information characters camera conventions imposed information 
plus minus 
abstraction relevant information allows camera see different creatures actors extract position orientation size motivational data emotional state 
forcing wide assortment characters structure opens problems 
example assessing height virtual snake real challenge 
actors request shots setting feature camera extracts sensors 
example actor set feature ready close 
value feature weighted input actor element character angle close order help win competing elements 
allowing direct communication actors camera tightened link characters actions moods expression screen 
emotions characters simple model emotion affects shots chosen sets parameters shots 
influencing elements motion style camera angle emotional state causes corresponding visual style 
emotion described function takes account default emotion rate change time internal external factors affect emotion level 
emotions characters scene factor prominently cinematography system emotion system shooting style reflects current feelings characters 
amount character influences mood weighted reflect character screen important character character feeling emotion 
emotions impact cinematography system 
example happy cut frequently spend time close shots move motion illuminate scene 
tried allow emotion percolate entire system 
emotion system flat arrangement happy sad angry surprised fearful elements 
structure useful people thinking emotions terms fairly easy create effects level 
considered emotional structure defines emotion space stance valence arousal frequently trying map back previous flat arrangement 
returned original system operates terms accessible designers participants 
motivations emotions broad scale effects choosing shots motivations stronger localized effect 
motivations similar formula emotions base levels inputs gains rates change 
tend expressed section action selection mechanism board emotion 
section higher level organization shots occurs 
action selection section broken functional elements actor angle motion style motivation section arranged conceptual effects 
motivation function determine value 
value input various shot elements action selection mechanism 
default motivational state fairly high constant value 
causes cinematography system relationships characters primary object interest 
starts higher shot interaction wide shot lets participants get bearings self inhibiting value soon drops sharply 
constant growth slowly rise allowed express 
takes inputs requests actors camera system high value primary emotion 
takes inputs requests actors 
requests occur character think deserves shot show 
lower level motivations affect action selection mechanism various ways 
example cinematography system look broken cut second cut 
motivation solve problem 
value high actor angle changed 
action selection mechanism behavior value twice value currently winning behavior order take adding large constant value actors angles actor angle take 
robust way preventing cuts happening rapidly hard coding actual minimum length 
action selection action selection mechanism means mutually exclusive behaviors organized groups mutual inhibition semantics forced compete basis output values 
behavior routine sends message earl lead actor code calculates world coordinates camera positioned oriented arranging hierarchical groups complex behavioral patterns occur recombining variety simple components 
clock tick behaviors mutual exclusion group calculate values determine active 
value process behavior value combination motivations emotions 
process weighted favor currently active behaviors behaviors closely matched values switch rapidly back forth behavioral aliasing 
structure sensors motivations emotions described functional means autonomous characters choose behaviors 
camera shot elements break cinematography main areas camera lighting 
section discuss elements combine shot

main parts camera decision process shot choice motion style selection 
shot choice involves choosing actor actors look angle look 
motion style section chooses characteristic feel camera moves world 
actor important decision camera actors watch 
camera watches character controlled participant 
people want see character tends skew actor picking section participant controlled character 
necessary camera able cut character character performing really interesting action eats chicken eggs swamped 
environment 
camera job reinforce relationships created actors screen 
kinds relationships relevant 
character character shot characters help establish 
shot camera calculates axis interesting actors chooses angle differential axis looking point line actors 
assures actors field view 
character world enabled camera select pieces set actors create shots actor set piece 
character participant show single character shot leading actor relevant element positioning shot 
rest section refer actor pair actors actor set piece target camera 
graphics system called tick camera position target position determines render scene 
angle addition deciding actors interested camera chooses angle respect target 
angle calculated coordinate system lead actor axis defined actors 
variety angle types developed serves different main purpose 
wide establishing angles useful orienting participant virtual world 
navigation angles positions camera track participant character participant see character going 
close ups expressive framed variety ways show specific emotion 
example low angle looking actor appear threatening higher angle appear fearful 
angles variety parameters adjust camera target positions amount rotate target distance move away actor proportion character height far ahead character look high camera emotionally determined percentage actor height camera stay fixed duration shot track character tracking target camera drift initial position 
motion camera angle selection focused enhancing interactivity motion characteristics camera main conduit emotional expressivity 
section motion decides parameters dynamical system springs affects camera moves virtual world 
changing settings spring dynamics system camera may move expressive range emotional effects 
example angry camera move abruptly sad camera move slow arcs happy camera slightly oscillating feel 
transition camera changes current choice actors angle transition new shot occurs 
transition variety different styles 
cut causes camera go immediately new position 
transition frequently movies 
pan causes camera space rapidly new position giving participants strong feeling motion 
helps keep participants oriented world 
occlusion detection shot elements determined system casts ray camera target see shot occluded 
possible characters set pieces way ruin shot 
cinematography system checks sure target thing ray encounters ensures camera line sight clear 
path occluded camera reposition 
example camera swamped goes straight forward line sight clear 
having camera calculate occlusion dimensional problem continues look straight ahead target moves helps avoid possibility lead actor happened walk camera go forever attempt get actor unoccluded shot 
lighting elements camera obvious element cinematography 
lighting design important subtle ways 
simply putting lights scene events visible camera carefully arranging lights myriad emotional effects provide subconscious cues participants 
split lighting design scene parts global lights personal lights 
global lights fixed position world personal lights travel characters provide specially tailored lighting 
interplay global lights personal lights camera 
camera moves close emotion shot character personal light increases intensity global lights dim bit 
causes character lighting design dominate illumination scene 
provides extreme emotional effects appropriate extreme effects normal illumination better navigation 
global global lights default lighting scheme lights providing key sources illumination 
global lighting scheme allows world maintain basic continuity helps orient user showing respect lights 
global lights affect coloration illumination world 
global light parameters controlled independently color intensity position 
color sets hue light baseline intensity 
intensity modulate light camera position 
varies full illumination coming camera far lead actor 
global lights positioned dominant light sources world sun camp fire personal personal lights allow character specially illuminated effect global lights 
character light changes color intensity position emotional state character 
positions lights determined characters coordinate systems appear travel characters 
global lights set behavior system camera personal lights distributed characters 
main benefits eases communication character emotions lighting character lighting design transportable part character 
transportable personal lighting design quite valuable allows characters keep personal light moved different scenario 
control color sky 
sky color special kind personal light personal light 
light lives behavior system causes sky color change reflect emotional state blending actors emotional states 
changing sky color sounds quite drastic occurs cartoons time 
substantial changes sky color virtual world laws physics apply 
camera sound taken steps enable cinematography system cooperate sound design composition 
currently score sound effects change camera position 
addition giving camera ability sounds active participant scene 
simple camera alive invisible observer 
soon hope camera able cut beat music
