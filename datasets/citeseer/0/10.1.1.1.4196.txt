noted nodes multicast tree aware parent nodeid received event parent 
node wish unsubscribe receiving event implementation transparently delays unsubscription event received 
subscriber management mechanism efficient topics different numbers subscribers varying scribe nodes 
list subscribers topic distributed nodes multicast tree 
pastry randomization properties ensure tree balanced forwarding load evenly balanced nodes 
balance enables scribe support large numbers topics subscribers topics 
subscription requests handled locally decentralized fashion 
particular rendez vous point handle subscription requests 
locality properties pastry discussed section ensure network routes root subscriber short respect proximity metric 
addition subscribers close respect proximity metric tend children parent multicast tree close 
reduces stress network links parent receives single copy event message forwards copies children short routes 
event dissemination publishers pastry locate rendez vous point topic 
publisher aware rendez vous point ip address publish message sent straight node 
publisher know ip address rendez vous point uses pastry route node route publish topicid asks rendez vous point return ip address publisher 
events disseminated rendez vous point multicast tree obvious way lines 
caching rendez vous point ip address optimization avoid repeated routing pastry 
rendez vous point fails publisher route event pastry discover new rendez vous point 
rendez vous point changed new node arrived old rendez vous point forward publish message new rendez vous point ask new rendez vous point forward ip address publisher 
single multicast tree topic publishers procedure publish events 
allows rendez vous node perform access control 
reliability publish subscribe applications may diverse reliability requirements 
topics may require reliable ordered delivery events whilst require delivery 
scribe provides best effort delivery events offers framework applications implement stronger reliability guarantees 
scribe uses tcp disseminate events reliably parents children multicast tree uses pastry repair multicast tree forwarder fails 
repairing multicast tree 
periodically non leaf node tree sends heartbeat message children 
events frequently published topic messages avoided events serve implicit heartbeat signal 
child suspects parent faulty fails receive heartbeat messages 
detection failure parent node calls pastry route subscribe message topic identifier 
pastry route message new parent repairing multicast tree 
example consider failure node 
node detects failure uses pastry route subscribe message root alternative route 
message reaches node adds children table forwarder sends subscribe message root 
causes node add children table 
scribe tolerate failure multicast tree roots rendez vous points 
state associated rendez vous point identifies topic creator access control list replicated closest nodes root node nodeid space typical value 
noted nodes leaf set root node 
root fails immediate children detect failure subscribe pastry 
pastry routes subscriptions new root live node numerically closest nodeid topicid takes role rendez vous point 
publishers likewise discover new rendez vous point routing pastry 
children table entries discarded periodically refreshed explicit message child stating continued interest topic 
tree repair mechanism scales fault detection done sending messages small number nodes recovery faults local small number nodes log bn involved 
providing additional guarantees 
default scribe provides reliable ordered delivery events tcp connections nodes multicast tree break 
example nodes multicast tree fail scribe may fail deliver events may deliver order 
scribe provides simple mechanism allow applications implement stronger reliability guarantees 
applications define upcall methods invoked scribe 
msg invoked scribe node forwards event msg children multicast tree 
method modify msg forwarded 
msg invoked scribe new child added node children tables 
argument subscribe message 
msg invoked scribe node suspects parent faulty 
argument subscribe message sent repair tree 
method modify msg add additional information sent 
example application implement ordered reliable delivery events defining upcalls follows 
defined root assigns sequence number event published events buffered root node multicast tree 
events retransmitted multicast tree repaired 
adds sequence number delivered node subscribe message retransmits buffered events sequence numbers new child 
ensure reliable delivery events buffered amount time exceeds maximal time repair multicast tree tcp connection breaks 
tolerate root failures root needs replicated 
example choose set replicas leaf set root algorithm paxos ensure strong consistency 
related scribe overcast narada implement multicast self organizing overlay network assume unicast support underlying network layer :10.1.1.12.7544
overcast builds source rooted multicast tree bandwidth measurements optimize bandwidth source various group members 
narada uses step process build multicast tree 
builds mesh group containing group members 
constructs spanning tree mesh source multicast data 
mesh dynamically optimized performing latency measurements adding removing links reduce multicast latency 
mesh creation maintenance algorithms assume group members know scale large groups 
scribe builds multicast tree top pastry network relies pastry optimize route locality proximity metric ip hops latency 
main difference pastry network scale extremely large number nodes algorithms build maintain network space time costs log bn 
enables support extremely large groups sharing pastry network large number groups 
bayeux similar scribe 
bayeux built top scalable peer peer object location system called tapestry similar pastry 
scribe supports multiple groups builds multicast tree group top tapestry tree built quite differently 
request join group routed tapestry way node acting root 
root records identity new member uses tapestry route message back new member 
tapestry node router route records identity new member 
requests leave group handled similar way 
bayeux scalability problems compared scribe 
firstly requires nodes maintain group membership information 
root keeps list group members routers hop away route keep list containing average members base tapestry routing 
secondly bayeux generates traffic handling group membership changes 
particular group management traffic go root 
bayeux proposes multicast tree partitioning mechanism ameliorate problems splitting root replicas partitioning members 
improves scalability small constant factor 
scribe expected amount group membership information kept node small subscribers distributed nodes 
additionally group join leave requests handled locally 
allows scribe scale extremely large groups deal rapid changes group membership efficiently 
mechanisms fault resilience bayeux scribe different 
mechanisms fault resilience proposed bayeux sender scribe uses receiver mechanism 
bayeux routers proactively duplicate outgoing packets paths perform active probes select alternative paths 
schemes disadvantages 
mechanisms perform packet duplication consume additional bandwidth mechanisms select alternative paths require replication transfer group membership information different paths 
scribe relies heartbeats sent parents children multicast tree detect faults children pastry reroute different parent fault detected 
additionally bayeux provide mechanism handle root failures scribe
