structures semantics statistics fundamental level key challenge data integration reconcile semantics disparate data sets expressed different database structure 
argue computing statistics large number structures offers powerful methodology producing semantic mappings expressions specify reconciliation 
essence statistics offer hints semantics symbols structures enabling detection semantically similar concepts 
methodology applied data management tasks involve search space complex structures enabling generation fly data integration systems 
data integration data integration pervasive challenge faced data management applications need query multiple data sources 
data integration crucial large enterprises multitude data sources progress large scale scientific projects data sets produced independently multiple researchers better cooperation government agencies data sources searching deep web part web hidden web forms

include query processing multiple autonomous systems processing xml documents semi structured data streaming network managing data ownership privacy organizational boundaries cases capturing locating data needed particular applications transforming machine processable form 
notable unique challenge data integration reconciling semantic heterogeneity sources integrated 
fundamental reason semantic heterogeneity hard data sets developed independently varying structures represent overlapping concepts 
structures mean choice data model relational xml object oriented ontology formalism particular choices designing schema naming relations attributes tags choices data types decomposition nesting structure 
presence variety structures unavoidable humans think differently applications data sets designed different needs 
efforts circumvent problem imposing standardized schemas met limited success best 
step reconciling semantic heterogeneity researchers developed languages describing semantic mappings expressions relate semantics data expressed different structures 
languages typically relate different structures variety query constraint expressions 
languages researchers developed algorithms query reformulation translate query posed schema set queries schemas 
generally research model management investigates general algebra manipulating structures called models mappings 
algebra includes operations merging applying transformations models composing inverting mappings 
structures statistics languages expressing semantic mappings disparate structures bottleneck create maintain mappings 
writing mappings tedious error prone repetitive 
fact integration projects half resources spent tasks 
clearly completely automating creation semantic mappings 
focus research reducing human effort needed process see survey 
statistics come play 
powerful approach discovering semantic mappings analyzing large number structures mappings particular domain 
intuition approach statistics computed large number structures provide hints semantics symbols structures 
statistics leveraged predict symbols disparate structures meant represent domain concept 
sense goal approach mirror success statistical analysis large corpora texts field information retrieval ir significant advances field natural language processing analyzing large corpora annotated sentences 
analogy fields highlights unique challenges face 
ir context text documents typically contain significant amount information high level redundancy 
ir techniques effective abstracting document bag words 
contrast context schema descriptions terse underlying semantics rich 
bag words abstraction suffice 
consequence exploit corpus schemas mappings need statistics provide hints deeper domain concepts finer granularity 
examples domain concepts representational variations step analyze corpus identify main concepts domain 
example corpus book inventory schemas may identify concept book warehouse cluster price related elements 
importantly discover variations concepts represented 
variations may differ naming schema elements grouping attributes tables granularity modeling particular concept 
knowledge variations leveraged match schemas domain 
relationships concepts set concepts discover relationships ways relationships manifested representation 
example find books table typically includes isbn column foreign key availability table isbn appears warehouse table 
relationships useful order prune candidate schema matches appear 
build system provides advice designing new schemas 
domain constraints leverage corpus find integrity constraints domain representations 
example observe isbn foreign key multiple tables involving books possibly identifier books discover data types certain fields address price 
constraints may ordering attributes 
example corpus web forms cars sale may discover attribute placed model price attribute occurs new attribute 
typically constraints discover way soft constraints sense violated taken rules thumb domain 
extremely useful resolving ambiguous situations selecting candidate schema matches 
important note examples close interplay properties underlying domain books warehouses properties representations domain particular relational structures schemas 
fact interplay reason technique powerful 
works applied approach various contexts 
doan address problem matching schemas data sources single mediated schema 
uses machine learning techniques compute models elements mediated schema set manually provided mappings 
models recognize mediated schema elements schemas unmapped data sources 
chang generate mediated schema domain analyzing corpus web forms domain 
madhavan leverage corpus schemas mappings match unseen schemas 
doing learns corpus models elements domain constraints domain 
application paradigm search web services locating web services operations relevant particular need 
simple keyword search suffice context keywords parameter names capture underlying semantics web service 
dong show analyze corpus web services cluster parameter names semantically meaningful concepts 
concepts predict web service operations similar functionality 
searching web services instance general class search problems objects searched rich semantics descriptions objects schema definitions wsdl descriptions terse fully capture semantics 
examples search problems trying locate web forms relevant particular information need locating relevant data sources enterprise 
examples simple keyword search suffice 
analyzing corpus objects statistics glean hints semantics objects offers powerful supplement keyword search 
outline major challenge field data integration benefit significantly general approach 
data integration challenge despite immense progress building data integration application major undertaking requires significant resources upfront effort technical expertise 
result data integration systems major drawbacks 
evolving system requirements organization change hard 
second smaller scale transient information integration tasks face daily basis supported 
challenge community fundamentally change cost benefit equation associated integrating data sources 
goal enable fly data integration facilitating evolution data integration applications enabling individuals easily integrate information personal possibly transient needs 
achieve goal believe data integration environment incorporate principles 
data integration tasks performed system accumulate analyze leverage prior tasks facing new task 
second data integration environment natural extension user personal information space information stores desktop 
way user extend personal data space public data sources seamlessly integrate personal information spreadsheets contacts lists personal databases organizational resources 
achieving goals substantially increase perception data management systems impact daily lives
