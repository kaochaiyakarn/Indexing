gather images image collection subsystem utilizes distributed fleet www robots running different computers 
image robots gather information images find computing appropriate image decompositions indices store extracted information vector form searches image content 
search time users iteratively guide search selection relevant examples 
search performance efficient approximate optimized tree algorithm 
system employs novel relevance feedback algorithm selects distance metrics appropriate particular query 
keywords image databases query image content content retrieval world wide web search engines 
software robots roving world wide web www collecting index information text documents find 
robots extract indexing information guide interactive searches 
scale databases impressive 
instance writing hot wired hotbot provides searchable index documents 
needed equivalent web image search engines crawl web collecting information images find computing appropriate image decompositions indices storing extracted information searches image content 
web image search engines applied profitably areas searching line catalogs consumer goods services museums libraries medical scientific data collections 
engines useful areas demand image copyright enforcement forensics intelligence gathering 
lastly web image robot useful machine vision researchers studying image databases provide large testbed image database indexing methods 
number unsolved problems image understanding building web image robot overly ambitious 
fortunately just providing moderately useful text search tools need require understanding text meaning searching images need require solving image understanding problem 
due scale unstructured nature www basic indexing tools welcome 
lycos generation text engines extracted keywords standard algorithms consider statistics word placement word frequencies indices provide advanced tools detecting word sense word meaning offer www documents matching search criteria 
despite drawbacks users eagerly indices navigate sift burgeoning growth web documents 
text engines provided important service www roughly akin unix grep provides searching ascii text files 
subsequent generations text engines built humble foundation 
similarly generation image engines need require solving image understanding problem 
general approach provide arsenal decompositions discriminants precomputed images color histograms edge orientation histograms texture measures shape invariants resulting information stored vector form 
search time users select weighted subset decompositions computing image similarity measurements 
approach taken imagerover system described 
resulting search tool provides powerful method data exploration browsing 
user typically queries find things 
exploration mode interactivity essential user looses interest 
large databases greater interactivity achieved approximation algorithms indexing 
approximate matches acceptable yield improved interactivity predictable graceful accuracy 
approach current estimates number images www complete index web images provide access images 
total number documents www estimated currently documents images :10.1.1.44.4418
size complete web image index presents challenges number fronts 
image collection 
experiments observed single threaded robot traverse web gathering images average rate image seconds 
gathering images potential take order years single threaded robot single computer 
address problem employing fleet robots distributed machines 
experiments indicate framework allow modest fleet robots collect images monthly

images gathered robot needs digest image extract needed image statistics decompositions create reduced resolution image thumbnail 
computation time needed accomplish processor algorithms employed clear single computer digest images reasonable amount time 
hurdle cleared multi processor approach 

image index search 
data navigation consider requirement user queries answered second 
places severe constraints methods metrics employed searching matches high dimensional vector space extracted image statistics millions images 
pointed white jain search time dependent intrinsic dimensionality space 
intrinsic dimensionality approximated principal components analysis dimensionality reduction 
speed enhanced approximate nearest neighbors indexing scheme 

user interface 
standard approach query example query keyword 
keywords limited usefulness difficult assign keywords consistently exhaustively 
query example difficult determine appropriate combination similarity measures particular search 
directly prompting users weightings problematic may require users grasp technical details underlying representation 
way allow users provide example images keeps image content parameters hidden user 
imagerover employs novel approach relevance feedback problem 
related date number query image content qbic demos available web virage ibm qbic photobook visualseek jacob nearly systems include form color texture image similarity measures 
addition systems provide search image composition shape faces groupings colored blobs 
systems provides web search engine operates local demo database images stored host web site 
algorithms developed qbic systems serve excellent starting point building www image search engines 
imagerover joined wave image search engines yahoo image surfer lycos media search tool webseer webseek :10.1.1.44.4418
yahoo image surfer software webseek provide primarily keyword browsing tool www images grouped category subcategory 
example categories actors animals architecture arts dance rock sports toys search time user page images deploy simple color histogram search similar images subcategory 
build index images semiautomatically classified hierarchy categories associated text labels 
unfortunately semi automatic algorithms entry metadata infeasible millions images populate index evolves daily 
systems lycos webseer extract keywords automatically image url possibly captions imbedded document contains image 
webseer system supplements keyword extraction cues image content grayscale vs color image dimensions file type size file date :10.1.1.44.4418
addition system includes face detector stores number faces largest face size 
search user type keywords describing sought choose preset toggle menu desired image dimensions file size range color 
pictures people desired user additionally preset toggle menu specify th number faces desired image desired camera shot close wide angle 
carefully extracted keywords may help guide search basic categories 
unfortunately keywords may accurately completely describe image content 
cues image content need come directly image especially search basic category cats cars 
imagerover approach similar spirit webseer differs allows searches web images image content
