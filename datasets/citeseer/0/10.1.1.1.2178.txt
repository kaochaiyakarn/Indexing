perform step subsequent steps correctly essential contact original thesaurus authors documentation unclear ambiguous 
step syntactic conversion step emphasis lies syntactic aspects conversion process source representation rdf 
typical source representations proprietary text format relational database xml representation 
step divided substeps 
step structure preserving translation 
step translation source format rdf format performed meaning translation reflect source structure closely possible 
translation complete meaning semantically relevant elements source translated rdf 
guideline basic set rdf constructs translation 
constructs defining classes subclasses properties domains ranges human readable rdfs labels class property names xml datatypes 
basic building blocks defining rdf representation conceptual model 
remaining rdf owl constructs step semantically oriented conversion 
argue application constructs domains ranges belong semantic conversion 
van schreiber wielemaker wielinga guideline preserve original naming possible 
preserving original naming results clear traceable conversions 
case duplicate property names prefix name source entity unique 
meaning class property explicated adding rdfs comment preferably containing definition original documentation 
documentation available online rdfs seealso rdfs statements link original documentation definition 
guideline translate relations arity structures blank nodes 
relations arity translated directly rdf properties 
relation arguments independent structure consisting node representing relation blank node linked relation node arguments linked blank node see examples section 
guideline translate semantically irrelevant ordering information 
source representations contain sequential information ordering list terms 
orderings may irrelevant semantic point view case left conversion process 
guideline xml support multilinguality 
simple built xml schema datatypes xsd date xsd integer useful supply schemas information property ranges 
userdefined xml schema datatypes problematic hopefully problem solved near 
literal values meant human consumption defined untyped plain literals allows xml lang specify language 
alternative define language entire rdf owl document adding xml lang label xml header 
concerning multilingual thesauri generally cases 
case thesaurus version exists language version having exactly hierarchical structure 
translated rdf hierarchy concept labeled equivalent term language multilingual labelling approach 
second case hierarchical structure language versions differ mapping needs defined version interlingual mapping approach 
deals case authors recognize complete methodology cover 
guideline avoid redundant information 
redundant information creates representations clear harder maintain 
example unique identifier ui resource recorded rdf id include properties record ui 
www org sw issues html structured datatypes method converting thesauri rdf owl guideline avoid interpretation 
interpretations meaning information original source meaning traced back original source documentation approached caution wrong interpretations result inconsistent inaccurate conversions 
approach method postpone interpretation see step 
step explication syntax 
step concerns explication information implicit source format intended conceptual model
