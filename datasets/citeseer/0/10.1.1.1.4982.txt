head word words disambiguated 
example contiguous sentences illustrating usage head word

feature property head word context 
instance hp nnp property having having proper noun nnp part speech tag proper noun immediately head word hp represents location head plus 
feature value features values depend specific example 
instance tag hp nnp binary feature value true word proper noun false word proper noun 
feature vector example represented vector 
features dimensions vector space vector feature values specifies point feature space

remaining words example ignored usually example ignored 
window allowed cross sentence boundaries 
head word appears near sentence window may overlap adjacent sentences special null characters fill positions missing words window
