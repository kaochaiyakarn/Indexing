web server log les current common web servers contain insu cient data thorough analysis performed 
contain useful data data mining system discover bene cial information 
web server log les customarily contain domain name ip address request user name user generated request applicable date time request method request get post name le requested result request success failure error size data sent back url referring page identi cation client agent
