automatic parameter estimation training data fellegi sunter introduced methods estimating optimal parameters probabilities likelihood ratio 
observed arbitrary agreement pattern classes matches nonmatches 
agreement pattern fields satisfy conditional independence assumption system equations unknowns estimate probabilities probabilities proportion 
conditional independence assumption corresponds exactly na bayes assumption machine learning 
winkler showed estimate probabilities em algorithm 
winkler demonstrated em algorithm estimates optimal parameters situations 
estimated probabilities particularly useful optimal vary significantly region 
particular conditional probability agreement name differ significantly urban region adjacent region

suitable subsets pairs em algorithm method unsupervised learning generally find classes correspond winkler demonstrated suitable situations 
situations classes correspond closely parameters form nearly optimal 
matching situations consider pairs files usually consider pairs agree geographic identifier postal zip code available additional characteristic character surname 
record linkage matching subsets pairs agreeing set characteristics called blocking 
best situation set blocking variables yields set pairs contains proportion matches 
instance blocking combination zip code character surname yield sets pairs having match proportion 
name surname age sex available em algorithm yields parameters situations 
consider pairs agreeing combination zip code character surname proportion pairs matches drop 
unsupervised learning method able parameters separate pairs classes approximate alleviate situation take initial guess parameters 
set pairs agreeing combination zip code character surname consider pairs having likelihood ratio certain point 
virtually situations yield set pairs proportion matches em yield optimal parameters 
verification efficacy approach extensions methods choosing pairs due 
accounting dependencies fields individual fields matching strong dependencies 
instance assume name address sex age match household data 
assume considering pairs brought zip character surname 
pair records agrees name pair probability close agree household characteristics house number street name phone number 
pairs records representing individuals household associated matches nonmatches 
ratio computed conditional independence assumption na bayes accuracy decision rules may reduced comparison situations dependencies variables accounted 
solution continue conditional independence em classes 
household variables name sex age separate matches nonmatches 
effect subdividing pairs household matches nonmatches 
resultant parameters combined associated classes decision rule applied 
partially accounts dependencies household variables 
alternatively general em methods account interactions variables 
step general iterative fitting algorithm generalizes iterative scaling algorithm della pietra 
theoretical computational aspects fully described 
particular convex constraints possibly prior knowledge parameters subsets parameter space 
narrow range situations parameters obtained general fitting procedures yield decision rules accurate estimates error rates 
accuracy estimates error rates partially confirmed larsen rubin extended em methods general mcmc methods 
combining labeled training data unlabeled data machine learning quite typical assume training data available 
training getting parameters needed classification decision rules method applied 
record linkage training data seldom available unsupervised learning conditional independence typically 
theoretical computational methods winkler extend situations combination labeled training data unlabeled data 
reason labeled training data unsupervised learning methods give reasonable estimates parameters 
instance typographical error rates vary significantly urban region adjacent 
probability age name match particular lower urban area area 
expensive obtain labeled training data individuals methods combining small amount training data large amount unlabelled data 
nigam showed combining text classification application applying na bayes networks 
winkler extended labeled unlabeled data model various interactions accounted 
record linkage application winkler demonstrated small amounts training data combined unlabeled data record linkage application 
main advantage record linkage application yielded reasonably accurate estimates error rates large class situations done belin rubin methods 
secondary advantage datamining experiments determine suitable interactions matching fields 
winkler observed sufficient amount training data needed combining unlabeled data 
training data tendency significantly reduce number computational paths get estimates closer obtained large amounts training data 
earlier winkler observed purely unsupervised methods yield parameter estimates totally unsuitable accurate decision rules 
unsuitable estimates occurred situations convex constraints estimated parameters various subregions parameter space
