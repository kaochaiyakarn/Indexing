concentrates research trends describes interesting developments research deficiencies 
examples include currently popular stereotype approach technique frequently employed modeling users domain knowledge 
active area moment plan recognition albeit research perspective application perspective 
interest modeling user preferences sharply risen particularly far users information preferences concerned 
new techniques information sources acquiring assumptions user explored 
techniques link user modeling research closely modern user interfaces previously employed techniques relied strongly fictional natural language interaction 
increased demand expressive representation systems user models powerful general inference mechanisms need assumption revision user models led transfer ai techniques user modeling research 
integrated representation reasoning revision tools called user modeling shell systems developed facilitate deployment user modeling components application systems 
empirical validation utility developed adaptive systems strongly gained importance 
results suggest users profit systems adapt needs 

user knowledge stereotype approach user modeling proposed rich ab rich refined chin proven useful application areas quick necessarily completely accurate assessment user background knowledge required 
approach developer user modeling component application system fulfill tasks user subgroup identification user model developer identify subgroups expected user population members possess certain homogeneous application relevant characteristics 
user population statistical database national hospitalization data cancer patients instance divided medical professionals scientists statisticians specific level doctors nurses medical statisticians hospital managers policy makers 
identification key characteristics user model developer identify small number key characteristics allow identify members user subgroup presence absence characteristics recognizable computer system 
example hospitalization database characteristics kind questions users ask terminology employ kind statistical information seek level help request representation hierarchically ordered stereotypes application relevant characteristics identified user groups formalized appropriate representation system 
collection represented characteristics user subgroup called stereotype subgroup 
contents stereotype form subset contents stereotype stereotype hierarchies may constructed contents superordinate stereotypes inherited subordinate stereotypes need represented

user plans emphasis put recognition users plans plan sequence user actions achieve certain goal 
plan recognition systems observe user input actions try determine possible user plans observed actions complemented 
set candidate plans unknown user plan narrowed soon new user actions occur 
basic algorithm fairly simple straightforward serious combinatorial problems arise practically employed due reasons unclear user commences new plan actions short action sequences may part plan users may interrupt suspend execution current plans various reasons issuing date command replying email message just received action sequence achieving sub goal variations user plans 
kinds techniques mainly employed recognition users plans plan libraries approach possible user plans pre stored socalled plan library possibly plans contain open variables instantiated 
observed user action sequence compared pre stored plans plans selected beginnings match observed user input 
approach difficult take possibility plan variations account 
permissible deviations plan stored separate plans 
plan construction approach system possesses library possible user actions effects preconditions actions 
observed user action sequence completed possible user action sequences fulfill requirement effects preceding actions meet preconditions subsequent actions 
generality plan library approach restricted requirement possible user plans specified 
need problem small domains users pursue limited number goals 
plan construction approach problematic complexity point view 
number possible extensions observed user input constructed action operators large particularly length user plan unknown 
investigates focusing heuristics favor analysis expansion certain plan candidates domain knowledge 
appelt pollack framework choosing competing plan weighted abduction 
raskutti zukerman address problem measuring coherence information content ascribed plan bayesian probability theory 
mayfield investigates terminate plan goal explanation chain concepts explanation completeness system expectations curiosity 
authors deal problem user actions may necessarily correct 
hesitant exclude plan candidates match user input mismatch small 
vein carberry provide unified framework recognizing plans slightly ill formed formed dialogs meta rules relax constraints necessary

guidelines prevent potential abuses far user modeling exclusively making computer systems cooperative 
course user models support system pursuing noncooperative interests 
small example ham ans jameson wahlster non cooperative mode deliberately user order positively influence decisions concerning particular hotel rooms book 
user modeling certainly important contribution making computers accessible casual users particularly general public subject potential misuse new technologies 
certain guidelines observed research practical applications order resist dangers early stage see kobsa detailed discussion users aware fact computer system contains user modeling component 
applications presence component may obvious particularly casual users 
user awareness user modeling abilities system necessary prerequisite order decide consent modeled system 
users instructed computer systems errors 
user modeling components draw assumptions user may necessarily correct 
user modeling inherently involves risk misunderstandings case normal communication people 
prudent encourage user guard possible misconceptions system anyway communicating people 
users instructed computer system pursue non cooperative interests 
user models may employed computer system supporting users goals cooperative way influencing users interests 
regard computer system objective expert representative concern rely strategies normally uses protect oneself influence people 
users possibility inspect necessary change user models 
anticipated applications user models comprise enormous amount fairly trivial assumptions difficult translate ordinary english 
difficult render user models comprehensible owners 
technically possible users able switch user modeling component consent modeled 
far clear possible separate user modeling component remaining system way user fact relinquish
