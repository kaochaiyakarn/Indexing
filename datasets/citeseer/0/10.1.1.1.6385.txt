emotion key aspect leadership recognizing managing interpersonal emotion 
virtual humans exhibit emotional behaviors cognitive biases expect high stake encounter bosnia scenario 
modeling emotion motivated cognitive appraisal theory psychological theory emphasizes relationship emotion cognition lazarus scherer 
view processes underlie emotional behavior 
appraisal characterizes organism goals desires vis vis environment 
example injured boy mother believes soldiers abandoning threat goals leads distress anger 
coping translates assessment strategic acts maintain positive negative 
lazarus classes coping strategies 
problem focused strategies act world include acting planning certain forms speech acts request order 
example mother troops remain scene 
emotion focused strategies act internally change beliefs desires 
example mother convince troops going help despite perceptual evidence 
coping appraisal interact unfold time 
example mother agent may feel distress accident appraisal motivates agent blame accident troops emotion focused coping transforms agent distress anger re appraisal 
re casting theory computational model tied coping agent information soar working memory including current state world derived perception module expectations acts derived task model consequences past events stored causal history 
facilitates reasoning blame indirect consequences action 
example threat sub goal landing zone secure sub goal intrinsically important facilitates larger goal boy 
data structures provides uniform representation past actions action caused effect achieve goal facilitate reasoning different agents perspectives think outcome believe think bad 
approach appraisal assesses agent environment relationship features explicit task representation gratch 
speaking loosely treat appraisal set feature detectors map features representation appraisal variables characterize consequences event agent perspective 
variables include desirability consequences likelihood occurring deserves credit blame measure agent ability alter consequences 
result feature detection data structures called appraisal frames characterize agent emotional reactions event 
belief agent caused undesirable outcome leads distress possibly anger 
computational model coping described marsella gratch similarly exploits task representation uncover features led emotion potential may altering features 
essence coping inverse appraisal 
discharge strong emotion situation obvious strategy change factors contributed emotion 
coping operates representations agent beliefs goals plans reverse seeking change directly indirectly desired impact appraisal 
coping impact agent beliefs situation importance threatened goal likelihood threat responsibility action agent form intentions change external factors example performing action removes threat 
coping strategies involve combination approaches mirroring coping processes understood operate human behavior people may employ mix coping emotion focused coping deal stress 
final aspect model concerns cognitive focus attention 
point time virtual humans potential emotions corresponding multiple features task representation 
appraisal frames cognitive focus lead expressed emotion coping behavior 
brought focus constituent data elements referenced mental operator currently consideration 
mental operators consist atomic soar operators implement various agent functions updating belief forming intention understanding speech act repairing plan 
example trainee asks virtual happened operator resolves referent question access data structures associated brought focus 
soar decision cycle multiple operators proposed parallel selected execution 
example agent considering possible courses action help boy vs help operators proposed parallel suggesting adoption 
appraisal frames associated actions brought focus 
focus mechanism allows expressed emotion closely mirror agent mental processes important modeling certain emotion focused coping strategies related mental focus attention avoidance 
prior computational models appraisal little prior modeling myriad ways people cope emotions 
coping behavior key aspect human behavior 
people employ rich set coping strategies different individuals tend adopt stable characteristic coping styles correlated personality type 
building library strategies uses personality inspired preference rules model consistent differences style different agents 
example virtual humans may take preemptive action circumvent stressful factor may choose shift blame agent may behaviorally attempts achieve goal thwarted threatened 
physical behavior virtual humans continually perceive internally process events surrounding understanding utterances updating beliefs formulating revising plans generating emotional choosing actions 
goal manifest rich dynamics cognitive emotional inner state character external behavior verbal nonverbal cues people understand 
key challenge range behaviors seamlessly integrated character body movements reflect awareness events virtual world physical actions myriad nonverbal signals accompany speech social interactions gaze shifts head movements gestures emotional reactions 
gaze indicates character focus attention key element model outward behavior closely synchronized character inner thoughts 
prior gaze virtual humans considered task related gaze chopra badler social gaze cassell produced integrated model 
gaze model driven cognitive model interleaves task related behaviors social behaviors attention capture 
task related behaviors checking status goal monitoring expected effect action trigger corresponding gaze shift attention capture hearing new sound environment 
gaze social interactions driven dialogue state state virtual human processing including gaze interlocutor speaking gaze aversion utterance planning claim hold turn gaze addressee speaking gaze expecting speak 
tight integration gaze behaviors underlying cognitive model ensures outward attention virtual humans synchronized inner thoughts 
body movements critical conveying emotional changes including facial expressions gestures posture gaze head movements marsella gratch rickel 
humans behaviors signals intentionally inform deceive unintentionally reveal information individual internal emotional state 
person behavior may express anger feel want think feel reasons 
prior emotional expression virtual humans focused intentional emotional expression window internal emotional state neal reilly 
attempts integrate aspects tying expressive behavior coping behavior 
noted earlier emotional changes virtual human unfold consequence soar operators updating task representation 
operators provide focus emotional processes invoking coping strategies address resulting emotions turn leads expressive behaviors 
focus operators centers emotional expression agent current internal cognitive processing allows coping alter relation expression internal cognitive processes 
example lieutenant asks happened agent openly express true appraisal feelings guilt concern example facial expressions gestures posture gaze head movements 
coping shifting responsibility accident mother initial expression guilt quickly suppressed 
express anger mother angry facial expression shaking head wave hand mother verbally saying calculated attempt persuade lieutenant 
wide range body movements typically closely linked speech movements emphasize augment supplant components spoken linguistic information 
consistent close relation nonverbal behavior include hand arm gestures head movements postural shifts typically synchronized time speech 
realizing synchronization faces challenge incremental model speech production 
model allow tie nonverbal behaviors speech production operations gaze coping behaviors tied cognitive operations 
approach plan utterance annotate nonverbal behavior 
annotated utterance passed text speech generation system schedules verbal nonverbal behavior beat system cassell 
approach similar cassell 

differs structure passed gesture annotation process order capture myriad ways nonverbal behavior relate spoken dialog internal state virtual human 
specifically systems pass syntactic semantic pragmatic structure utterance additionally pass emotional appraisal coping information associated components utterance 
gesture annotation process uses information annotate utterance gestures head movements eyebrow lifts 

summary previous section indicates virtual humans require number sophisticated abilities order produce human behavior complex world 
areas generally taken broader view issue 
important result just range functioning individual components way provide human behavior 
emotion reasoning done isolation respect cognitive function perception dialogue interaction 
focusing mechanism just emotional reasoning providing dialogue responses interpreted broad open questions 
perception updates belief motivates action moving contact voice level dialogue 
soar architecture greatly facilitates interactivity facilitates parallel serial processing allows easy access component data structures 
mission rehearsal exercise project takes step realizing ultimate goal creating immersive environment people hold extended dialogues virtual characters world
