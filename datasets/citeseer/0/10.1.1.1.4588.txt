background impossible give complete review vast area spanning text analysis molecular interactions databases allow review consume page limit article 
important give cursory overview accomplishments key research areas related described current 
key research topics correspond major computational problems encountered researcher long winding road collection plain english texts useful database molecular interactions 

document sorting large database abstracts journal articles pubmed www ncbi nlm nih gov entrez index html researcher needs distinguish papers relevant interests millions non relevant ones 
example interested articles having cell cycle title interested articles talking fur export 
task document sorting viewed classical task machine learning problem automated classification objects classes relevant nonrelevant case 
classification start set examples provided known class assignment supervised machine learning methods training dataset unsupervised learning 
implemented unsupervised approaches document sorting include clustering article abstracts assuming relevant non relevant clusters form separate groups 
supervised methods applied problem include na bayes classifier support vector machines 

term identification second set documents believes relevant interests researcher needs identify terms names genes proteins diseases tissues 
term identification critical text preprocessing stage required natural language processing engines including 
researchers attempted attack problem inferring morphological rules guide generation term speech tagging engines help downstream applications identify multiword noun phrases grammar rules combinations rule dictionary methods support vector machines hidden markov models na bayes decision trees classifiers :10.1.1.33.4599:10.1.1.50.11
appears problem tagging biological terms difficult may achieve better results combining approaches 
early approaches tested small test sets reported excellent reports precision recall 
results reported larger test sets achieved results ranged mid precision recall 

term meaning disambiguation third having identified terms researcher realizes problem term identification confounded term multiple meanings term ambiguity multiple terms correspond concept term synonymy 
example name refer gene protein messenger rna depending sentence context 
deducing right meaning known sense disambiguation problem tackled machine learning approaches na bayes decision trees inductive learning classifiers 
common examples synonymous names pairs abbreviated complete protein names il stands terms occur biological texts 
problem synonyms alleviated automatically generated dictionaries 
see liu overview word sense disambiguation applied biomedical domain 

information extraction fourth identified disambiguated terms researcher wants information extraction remember researcher wants extract information molecular interactions 
choice methods vary complexity success 
group approaches correlation methods exploit information occurrence terms articles abstracts 
sophisticated form methods hidden markov model requires dictionary terms 
methods second group target information extraction template matching identify regular expressions text term dictionary collection hand crafted patterns 
methods third group explicitly formal grammars identify nested structures sentence 
nutshell grammar set allowed symbols usually divided terminal words observe sentence non terminal invisible symbols serve intermediates imaginary process generating sentence set production rules capability expressing regular expressions nested structures 
production rules generate sentence stepwise substitution starting single top level non terminal symbol sentence contains terminal words 
grammar valid sentence reconstruct sequence substitution events usually expressed parse tree leading generation sentence grammar process called parsing 
geneways project molecular biology related linguistic projects grammar parsers 
different projects different foci typically tested small datasets currently impossible tell confidence relative performance methods expect methods higher precision 
method requires access dictionary listing properties words recognizes lexicon information allowable combinations patterns words encoded rules 
information currently supplied manual analysis sample texts consultation domain experts

discussion 
hand databases automatically produced databases popular molecular interaction databases ecocyc kegg populated groups careful experts 
manual databases designed provide consensus view evolving field molecular biology devoid redundancy inconsistencies usually low error rate express extremely complex statements underlying biological systems 
contrast geneways knowledge base designed capture stochastic view field statements tend repeat conflict statement associated publication time point 
geneways knowledge base include larger number errors manual databases note general rigorous evaluations precision manual databases undertaken number types relationships extracted automatically smaller extracted human expert 
automatic systems populate quickly extremely large database larger current database unique statements repetitive conflicting statements extracted automatically treated essentially experimental data see 
volume text data currently available tremendous statistical approaches analysis statements extracted literature appear promising requisite 

binary versus ary relationships contradiction representation pathways information optimized convenience computation representation captures text encoded statement optimized precision 
computation large pathway database easiest relationships converted binary form protein binds protein text encoded information corresponds binary tertiary quaternary higher order relationships 
example statement proteins synergistically activate gene represents tertiary relationship captured see detailed discussion biomedical sublanguages

follows evaluation system precision part system associated term tagging see detailed discussion problem 
general difficult identify name substance process text favorite examples difficult gene names include forever young plant arabidopsis mothers fly drosophila 
improved term tagging lead significant reduction error rate 
plague system associated term synonymy 
compiled database gene protein name synonyms dictionary approach appears insufficient 
example tumor suppressor currently stored gene ways knowledge base separate substances expressions meaning difficult recognize automatically synonyms 
totally different difficulty associated translations sublanguages scientific community 
chemical event may expressed strikingly different ways different sublanguages different research literature 
example language molecular biology statement protein kinase protein means thing expression atp adp journal biomedical informatics language biochemistry atp adp stand respectively denotes phosphate residue 
note biochemical description kinase part equation merely catalyst facilitating reaction 
hard core may argue molecular biologists say incorrect communities able understand statements correctly dealing sublanguages requiring translation 
articles analyzed geneways written language molecular biology potential users resulting database speak biochemical sublanguage probably precise automated translation statements may necessary 

biological terminology difficulty recognizing terms tumor suppressor synonyms major problem deciding protein name ends description function starts
