conventional auctions sell single item time combinatorial auctions sell multiple items interdependent values simultaneously allow bidders bid combination items 
combinatorial auction bidder express complementary substitutable preferences multiple bids 
account complementary substitutable preferences increase participants utilities revenue seller 
widespread research auctions including combinatorial auctions deals models price unique strategic dimension 
situations necessary conduct negotiations multiple attributes deal 
example case allocating tasks attributes deal may include starting time deadline accuracy level service characterized quality supply time risk involved case service supplied eventually 
product characterized attributes size weight supply date problem complicated case multiple tasks services products 
example task constructing large building divided subtasks 
constructor able handle multiple subtasks specialized particular subtask 
addition constructor may contract processes different conditions quality appointed date price utility government may depend conditions complex fashion
