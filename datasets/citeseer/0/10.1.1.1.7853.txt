organised follows 
firstly system user viewpoint functionalities interface describe semantics reasoning services supporting query interface 
include query language expressiveness ontology support query formulation natural language verbalisation issues 
discuss related draw 
query interface user perspective initially user choice different query scenarios provide meaningful starting point query construction 
interface guides user construction query means diagrammatic interface enables generation precise unambiguous query expressions 
query expressions compositional logical structure flat tree shaped node arbitrary number branches connecting nodes 
structure corresponds natural linguistic concepts noun phrases propositional phrases 
contain nested noun phrases 
query composed list terms coming ontology classes supplier multinational 
branches constituted property attributes associations value restriction query expression selling italian market selling association italian market ontology term 
focus paradigm central interface user experience manipulation query restricted defined visually delimited subpart query focus 
compositional nature query language induces natural navigation mechanism moving focus query expression nodes corresponding tree 
constant feedback focus provided interface means kind operations allowed 
system suggests operations compatible current query expression sense cause query unsatisfiable 
verified formal model describing data sources 
main requirements interface accessed html browser presence restrictive firewalls 
constraints design appearance shown 
interface composed functional elements 
top part shows natural language representation query composed current focus 
second query manipulation pane bottom part containing diagram representing focus terminological context tools specialise query 
query result pane containing table representing result structure 
components compose query third specify data retrieved data sources 
lack space concentrate query building part 
discuss query result pane allows user define columns table going organise data query result 
query textual representation component consists text box representing query expression natural language fashion 
user selects subparts query refinement 
selection defines current focus represented diagrams described sections 
selected subexpression modified refined extended means query manipulation pane 
query verbalisation provide accounts query structure system aware nesting user 
system provides feedback nesting means navigation query expression user interested selecting subpart query 
node selected system automatically selects subtree rooted node selected user 
important stress natural language feedback represent query generation mode 
user write queries directly need parse natural language sentence resolve linguistic ambiguities 
query manipulation pane elements pane represent current selection operations allowed context 
organised diagram showing taxonomic context selection central part tools enabling user build query expression 
central part interface occupied diagram allowing call substitution navigation possibility substituting selected portion query specific general terms 
central part diagram shows main term focus 
surrounding terms specific general query expression focus viewpoint 
example query showed focus term supplier terms merchant agent general term ontology retailer specific 
selecting terms user substitute focus selected term 
purpose substitution group twofold enables replacement focus shows position selection terms ontology 
case ontology terms equivalent selected part 
case user offered replace selection equivalent term activation equivalent button 
different refinement enabled interface compatible terms 
terms ontology overlap focus non empty 
ontology terms added head selection concept pop menu 
example student compatible terms focus employee textile 
compatible terms automatically suggested user means appropriate reasoning task ontology describing data sources 
analogously user add properties focus associations industry sector attributes employee name 
performed means add property pop menu presents possible alternatives 
name value restrictions property meta information associated terms ontology 
example association sector restriction textile shown belonging textile sector 
note terms prop erties proposed system depend query expression focus 
means subparts query expression taken isolation generate different suggestions actual context query 
sub queries associated new names means button 
process corresponds definition new named view 
newly introduced names shorten query expression simple mechanism extend ontology build customised user viewpoint 
query interface inside box query building interface 
section describe underpinning technologies techniques enabling user interface described previous sections 
start describing assumptions query language followed system perspective described query building process 
system supported formally defined reasoning services described section 
introduce verbalisation mechanism enables system show queries natural language fashion 
conjunctive queries interface build concept classes properties consider conjunctive queries composed unary classes binary attribute associations terms 
body query considered graph variables constants nodes binary terms edges 
query connected acyclic corresponding graph property holds 
form query expressions composed interface introduced section restrict acyclic connected queries 
restriction dictated requirement casual user comfortable language 
note query language restrictions affect ontology lan technique deal disjunction conjunctive queries limited form negation applied single terms 
see technical details 
guage terms defined different case expressive language 
complexity ontology language left completely hidden user doesn need know 
transform query expression conjunctive query proceed recursive fashion starting top level transforming branch 
new variable associated node list ontology terms corresponds list unary terms 
branch added binary query term corresponding property restriction recursively expanded way 
consider example query supplier multinational selling italian market located europe meaning supplier located europe 
firstly new variable associated top level supplier multinational 
assuming top level variable default part distinguished variables conjunctive query suppl mult dots mean part query expanded 
consider property selling value restriction italian market introduces new variable 
second branch expanded way generating conjunctive query suppl mult sell market loc eur 
transformation bidirectional connected acyclic conjunctive query represented query expression sense section dropping variable names 
matter fact system inverse transformation internal representation queries conjunctive queries 
query tree focus corresponds selected sub tree 
easy realise sub tree identified variable corresponding node 
focus variable moving focus corresponds selecting different variable 
modifying query sub part means operating corresponding sub tree modifying corresponding query tree 
substitution navigation corresponds substitute sub tree chosen ontology term 
result tree composed single node branch unary term ontology term 
refinement compatible terms selected terms simply added root node unary query terms 
property extension adding attribute associations corresponds creation new branch 
operation introduces new variable node corresponding restriction 
attribute selected constant expression specified added restriction value variable
