task classifying textual data difficult intensively studied :10.1.1.1.5684
traditional machine learning programs training corpus hand classify new test examples 
training sets extremely small due difficult tedious nature labeling decisions difficult high confidence 
huge number unlabeled examples articles web sites sources information exist useful take advantage additional information automatic fashion 
sources looked background knowledge aid classification task

nigam background examples labeling classifier formed original labeled data adding training data learn new classifier resulting expanded data repeating anew labeling originally unlabeled data :10.1.1.1.5684

latent semantic indexing lsi 
lsi automatic method re describes textual data new smaller semantic space 
lsi assumes exists inherent semantic structure documents terms corpus 
new space created lsi places documents appear related close proximity 
lsi believed especially useful combating polysemy word different meanings synonymy different words describe concept classification tasks difficult 
key idea background text creation new re description data relying solely training data 
section give brief review lsi describe traditional text classification classification presence background text 
describe results system different data sets comparing results systems incorporate unlabeled data 
conclude discussion current ongoing area 

approach latent semantic indexing latent semantic indexing assumption underlying semantic structure textual data relationship terms documents re described semantic structure form :10.1.1.20.2241
textual documents represented vectors vector space 
position vector represents term typically word value position equal term appear document having positive value 
previous research represent positive values log total frequency document weighted entropy term 
result corpus looked large term document matrix position xij corresponding presence absence term row document column 
matrix typically sparse documents contain small percentage total number terms seen full collection documents 
unfortunately large space documents related semantically share words appear distant occasionally documents related share common words appear closer 
due nature text concept represented different words words ambiguous meanings 
lsi reduces large space hopefully captures true relationships documents 
singular value decomposition svd matrix product matrices matrices left right singular vectors diagonal matrix singular values 
diagonal elements ordered magnitude matrices simplified setting smallest values zero 
columns correspond values set zero deleted 
new product simplified matrices matrix approximation term document matrix 
new matrix represents original relationships set orthogonal factors 
choice parameter important 
previous shown small number factors achieves effective results 
discuss section current 
think factors combining meanings different terms documents documents re expressed factors 
lsi retrieval query represented new small document collection represented 
done multiplying transpose term vector query matrices query represented way distance query documents computed cosine metric represents numerical similarity measurement documents 
lsi returns distance query documents collection 
documents higher cosine distance value cutoff point returned relevant query 
lsi text classification lsi text classification henceforth refer document collection training examples query test example 
single example labeled may judged method similar range different training examples necessary decide different examples vote label new example 
take approach cohen hirsh 
look result lsi query table containing tuples train example train class cosine distance line table document training collection 
lines table train class value combined arrive score class 
cohen hirsh noisy operation combine similarity values returned lsi arrive single value class 
cosine values documents class 
sn final score class si 
whichever class highest score returned answer classification task 
closest neighbors kept combined 
incorporating background knowledge power lsi lies fact place documents share words close proximity 
little data lsi suffer drastically 
training examples terms occur limiting power lsi create space reflects interesting properties data 
interesting singular value decomposition transformation deal classes training examples 
gives extremely flexible learner addition background knowledge quite easy 
simply creating term document matrix training examples combine training examples sources knowledge create larger term document matrix xn 
lsi run new term document matrix obtain xn 
xn model space unobtainable training examples 
larger matrix contains words occur training examples provides richer contrast uses lsi classification centroid vector formed class new example labeled classes vector sufficiently close 
reliable patterns data domain 
classify test example incorporating background knowledge deci sion process test example re described new space compared columns xn correspond original training examples 
scores obtained comparison combined noisy operation return final class classification 
clearly important background knowledge similar content original training set combined 
background knowledge totally unrelated training corpus example lsi successfully model background knowledge features unrelated actual classification task 
give concrete example lsi background help look test example domain
