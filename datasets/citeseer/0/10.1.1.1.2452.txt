icap interface icap window main areas see 
left tabbed window repository user defined inputs outputs rules 
input output components associated graphical icons dragged center area construct conditional rule statement 
center area contains elements conditional rule statement inherent context aware applications 
example rule john office pm temperature degrees 
icap user interface example rule uses input sheets jane bedroom temperature degrees turn heater house 
left side represents portion rule conditional split sheets 
inputs single sheet related conjunction multiple sheets related disjunction 
right side area represents portion rule condition 
disjunction different outputs rare single output sheet currently supported 
implemented pane myers matching scheme allow users visually specify boolean logic rule 
traditional pull menus executing commands pie menus better support pen interaction 
addition support gestures issuing common commands cut copy paste inputs outputs 
interaction icap involves specifying inputs outputs elements construct application rules testing entire set rules run mode 
creating inputs outputs input output component icap associated graphical icon 
icons sketches drawn user creation component 
icon colored differently depending input output device 
repository window pie menu supports creation inputs 
input contains suffix degrees celsius temperature type integer string categories primary types context activity identity location time 
input potential values provided range list 
outputs created manner inputs contain different parameters specify 
output binary gradient device 
default number levels gradient device inclusive 
addition categories output device associated corresponding human senses sight sound smell taste touch 
constructing rules rules constructed dragging dropping inputs outputs sheets rule 
example user interested temperature sensor define temperature input drag corresponding icon respective sheet 
dragging corresponding icon user needs setup certain parameters conditions governing behavior input 
temperature sensor user may want know temperature degrees possibly degrees 
allow user specify conjunction conditions operators equal greater equal equal 
multiple condition sets defined related disjunction 
evaluating application number rules defined entire rule set tested icap engine run mode 
engine set simulate context aware environment conjunction real context aware environment 
users interact engine change value defined inputs evaluate behavior rules tested 
engine users able quickly design test applications having create entire infrastructure collecting simulating context writing code 
related icap inspired previous ubiquitous computing applications specifically involve development rule conditions 
include agentsheets stick notes 
tools designed building applications icap focused helping developers rapidly prototype test iterate context aware applications 
directions received informal feedback local designers context aware systems planning conduct formal study icap number real users see features improve interaction system 
goal enable designers users ability create modify context aware applications giving power programmers enjoy today
