web services fundamentals exists variety xml standards concerning web services 
briefly survey important ones needed understand 
soap standard soap xml communication protocol distributed applications 
soap designed exchange messages containing structured typed data top different transfer protocols smtp simple mail transfer protocol ftp file transfer protocol 
soap de facto standard current landscape web services 
soap define application semantics broad range applications 
simply deliver single message complex tasks request response message exchange rpc remote procedure call 
xml document shows basic structure soap message consisting parts envelope optional header mandatory body 
element root element message contains elements header body 
header element message offers generic mechanism extend soap protocol decentralized manner 
extensions web service security 
defined soap header extension transmit web service context soap messages see section

context web services literature number different definitions uses term context :10.1.1.12.4426:10.1.1.41.2924
context encompasses information client web service may utilized web service adjust execution output provide client customized personalized behavior 
context different parameters web service context information interesting number web services parameters exactly web service belong 
consequence context evaluated automatically service platform 
simplifies development web services evaluation context need integrated web services 
difference context information optional parameters mandatory 
context information need passed web service web service necessarily need understand process 
context infrastructure framework context transmitted soap header block soap messages web services receive send see soap envelope soap header header block context context block context block header block soap body context type location context type client context soap message figures example 
legacy web service platforms support context information may ignore specific header block conformity soap standard 
context information optional web services executed legacy platforms able process requests lose benefit context information 
analogous soap header context consists context blocks 
context block associated context type exactly defines type context information context block allowed contain 
context block allowed specific context type context blocks associated context type 
context contains context blocks associated context type location information consumer current location context type client information client hard software 
information context types supported context framework section 
context type unique context type identifier 
identifier equal qualified name xml elements represent corresponding context blocks identifiers valid qualified names 
qualified name xml element composed namespace element name 
example context block element client namespace sg fmi uni passau de context 
consequently associated context type sg fmi uni passau de context client 
omit namespace part context blocks context types corresponding element names 
context types basically distinguish context blocks 
example web service wants access information context specifies type context information wants retrieve context type identifier 
context infrastructure determines corresponding context block identifier returns 
infrastructure knowledge context type identifier sufficient allowing access context type guaranteeing context contains context block context type 
set context header block web service platforms process context fail processing message 
env envelope xmlns env schemas org soap envelope env header context xmlns sg fmi uni passau de context location address office addressline street keyvalue addressline addressline city keyvalue passau addressline address location client example com context device pda hardware hardware client context env header env body serialized object data env body env envelope infrastructure require validation context block content schema context type provide possibility especially free web services task 
purpose context type published uddi repository tmodel 
tmodel identifier context type specified 
content validation possible xml schema document referenced defines schema corresponding context blocks conform 
validation context block fails context block marked incorrect

example context block modified illustrated color change gray new context block third black rectangle inserted 
web service invokes service execution current context automatically inserted outgoing request 
response request may contain context information

furthermore returned context may utilized client adjust web service response 
entire context life cycle potential privacy security issues considered

furthermore policies state client allowed modify local context 
partly issues considered section 
elaborate privacy security policies scope 
context processing context framework distinguish types context processing explicit processing web services clients automatic processing context framework 
explicit context processing explicit processing means web services clients directly access context contained soap message framework context api consequently context processing functionality part code 
tight coupling web services clients context types able process 
web services clients utilize context types known integrated development time 
disadvantage additional coding effort similar context processing functionality basically contained web services clients 
strict separation concerns missing 
advantage type context processing web services clients full control context information influences control flow replies 
additionally access context information modify 
example explicit processing client implemented 
processes returned context information adjust response device capabilities stylesheet information inserted returned context

automatic context processing done context framework web services involved 
consequence context processing task moved web services service platform coding effort web services reduced 
disadvantage course web service requests responses modified internal process flow adjusted means 
different points time context processed automatically see incoming soap request invoked web service pre processed context request 
furthermore web service invokes services invocation manager outgoing messages requests services post processed sent incoming messages responses outgoing requests pre processed returned web service 
outgoing response invoked web service post processed service current context modified version received 
sum means messages invoked web service modified context information 
course modification messages implies messages content modified content web service reply
