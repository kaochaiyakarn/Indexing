give overview approach 
order deal complexities speech recognition natural language understanding employ drastic restrictions assumptions necessary 
example reduce noise require user headset 
trying extract meaning word chain heavily rely assumption application domain prespecified fairly small 
particular focus coffee mail delivery tasks assume user knowledge limitations system uses fairly simple instructions 
system devised extensible complicated dialogues handled applications added 
speech control roughly consists parts speech recognition software semantic parser 
speech recognizer extracts word chain analog speech signal 
parser builds semantic representation word chain keyword spotting method 
simplest case detecting keyword coffee may needed determine user wants coffee 
semantic representation passed golog system initiate appropriate actions may include interaction user 
basic structure system shown 
problems arise word chain faulty strategies devised prevent wrong robot behavior due wrongly detected words

overview 
basic principles statistical speech recognizer shown 

basic structure statistical speech recognizer idea roughly find representation acoustic signal look word chain best matches representation 
representation extracted dividing signal overlapping frames milliseconds duration fast fourier transformation discrete cosine transformation assigning frame called feature vector sequence feature vectors xt finding probable word chain phrased terms conditional probabilities jx read select word chain probability maximal 
problem course find appropriate probability distribution apply bayes rule obtain jw non statistical methods nearest neighborhood neural networks usual denominator bayes rule ignored 
need determine probability distributions ffl conditional probability distribution jw called acoustic model describes words linked feature vectors ffl priori distribution word chain linguistic language model describes occurrence probability particular word series distributions usually obtained analyzing large training sets involving baysian update 
go details mention hidden markov models employed acoustic model linguistic model simplified called uni bi trigram models 
example trigram model defined wn gamma wn gamma typical problems dealing speech recognition ffl speech heavily speaker dependant 
ffl large variation pronunciations phoneme 
ffl effect coarticulation sounds standing context 
example pronounced differently front front 
ffl background noise thorough training testing speech recognizer quality system vary significantly practice 
speech recognizers project experimenting existing speech recognizers 
speech recognition system speech recognition group ney department software originally written context car navigation 
needs detailed language model achieve reasonable word error rate 
system trained speaker independent 

philips speech recognizer mobile phones devices 
able spot keywords continuous speech 
language model recognizer detailed 
speaker independent training built automatic phonetic transcription 
unfortunately experimental results kind training far 
support spot keywords comes handy deal semantic interpretation section 
problems system due recognition errors word error rate 
major cause problems noise environment 
surroundings mobile robots normally quiet 
example frequently people talking nearby 
robot noise quite disturbing example rough floor carl produces sound speeding slowing 
interference easily degrades correct word recognition 
noise principal reduced appropriate filters currently available speech software 
opted controlled environment minimize noise 
systems fitted acoustic filters hope able microphones placed directly robot 
semantic interpretation word chain may may faithful representation users utterances task extract meaning 
words ball park natural language understanding 
communicating moving robot real time response important vital 
example robot moving close stairs going want sure carl command obeyed immediately high probability 
errors speech recognition unavoidable nice system tolerates certain amount noise 
order chance succeeding decided early heavily rely fact communication user robot random focussed accomplishing tasks prespecified application delivery 
speech recognizers experimenting supports keyword spotting sense follow simple keyword approach trying extract meaning 
advantage allowing errors words keywords articles 
example suppose user utters carl please bring nice big cup coffee 
sense suffice extract words bring coffee just coffee order evoke reasonable response going coffee machine fetching cup coffee 
essentially done 
parser extracts keywords relevant application domain hand 
synonyms related expressions letter document form equivalence classes order keywords ignored certain cases room destination follow 
word chain system extracts set attributevalue pairs represent meaning word chain 
example carl bring coffee room system produce structure key coffee action bring person room time refers speaker time means coffee delivered immediately explicit time 
naturally simplistic approach natural language understanding ways fool system 
example way dealing negations 
experiments encouraging useful fairly robust interactions user robot possible provided user aware limitations sticks simple instructions 
golog golog logical language programming complex actions 
situation calculus dialect second order logic briefly introduce 
go language detail note features terms language sorts ordinary objects actions situations special constant reader may wonder existing natural language system 
short answer know satisfy constraints outlined mention fact implementation fit small pc running linux 
denote initial situation situation actions occurred distinguished binary function symbol denotes successor situation resulting performing action relations truth values vary situation situation called relational fluents denoted predicate symbols situation term argument similarly functions varying situations called functional fluents denoted analogously special predicate poss state action executable situation language formulate theories describe world changes result available actions 
possibility basic action theory form ffl axioms describing initial situation ffl action precondition axioms primitive action characterizing poss 
ffl successor state axioms fluent stating conditions holds function holds situation take place called effect axioms provide solution frame problem 
ffl domain closure unique name axioms actions 
ffl foundational domain independent axioms 
achieving goal oe situation calculus formula means proving axioms exists situation reachable initial situation finite sequence primitive actions oe holds 
action sequence possible 
golog extends calculus allowing form program complex actions primitive ones control structures familiar imperative programming language 
sequence tests oe nondeterministic selection je iteration nondeterministically picking argument perform action pi recursive procedures 
small example robot serving coffee proc bring coffee ask milk ask sugar wants milk give milk wants sugar give sugar delete wants coffee endproc proc 
go endproc proc bring coffee wants coffee bring coffee endproc proc control true wants coffee bring coffee room wait interval endif endwhile endproc bring coffee carl goes specified room asks person name wants milk sugar 
depending answers carl puts milk sugar 
served coffee deletes coffee request carl goes specified room 
third procedure person room picked nondeterministically person room wants coffee delivered 
forth procedure control unifies procedures coffee waiter 
job waiter wait wants coffee 
wants carl wait room request 
golog control robot realistic setting demonstrated principle 
original golog downside form sensing interaction handled outside formalism golog programs processed offline executing primitive actions 
moved developed university toronto offers action executed parallel importantly allows dealing sensing online interpretation 
note example involves simple form sensing asking user wants milk sugar 
connecting speech golog semantic representation utterances various way golog 
simplest implemented provide direct mapping semantic representation call golog procedure executed 
example key coffee action bring person room time mapped bring coffee assuming robot knows refers room moving features offers 
particular rigidly mapping spoken instructions canned golog routines speech input thought special form sensing outcome sensing initiate appropriate golog instructions
