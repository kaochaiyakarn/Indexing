scientific collaboration semantic reconciliation crucial scientific collaboration 
consider case integrated environmental models 
models represent consensus understanding earth systems reached scientists field period time 
composed sub models attempt capture particular environmental systems 
example ground water models describe subsurface water flow models describe movement water soils 
sub models describe small parts environment address questions concerning environment 
challenge find ways integrating successfully subset sub models deal specific goal preserving autonomy individual models 
words integration sub models goal driven peers similarly integration heterogeneous information sources query driven preserving autonomy individual models information sources services 
goal query may require elicitation different interpretations models information sources services specific contexts
