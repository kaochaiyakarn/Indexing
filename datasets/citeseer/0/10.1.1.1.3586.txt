main features resource description framework rdf ability interconnect information resources resulting graph structure connectivity central notion 
argue basic concepts graph theory degree path diameter play important role applications involve rdf querying 
considering fact data model influences set operations provided query language follows need graph operations support rdf query languages

adjacency 
node edge adjacency important various contexts

parameters include labels certain grammar transitivity desired specifying fixed set nodes included path 

form pattern matching supported 
current rdf query languages support feature form conjunction triples 
extension matching simple graph grammar expressions deserves studied 

aggregate functions
