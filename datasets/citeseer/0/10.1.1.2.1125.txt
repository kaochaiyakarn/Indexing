research group completed simple implementations representations featured virtual wolves showed siggraph 
second area research involves development relates social learning 
animals born certain innate behaviors example crucial behavior left learning 
simulating timing innate behaviors active inactive context learning system allow virtual creatures created similar real animals 
blend hard coded behaviors learned behaviors create virtual creatures behave certain fashions ability adapt vagaries local environment 
main area project hope implement coming months 
wolves play different roles grows depending composition pack built developmentally timed behavioral learning undergone life 
variety real world applications research

just individual animals provide models creating individual agents populations animals may inspire mechanisms individual agents interact 
environments inhabited populations artificial entities variable uncertain important creatures certain behaviors learn adapt meet constraints imposed environment 
gray wolf natural environment gray wolves form complex social groups called packs 
core packs family breeding pair adults adult offspring breeding pair 
average pack size approximately individuals packs may contain wolves 
large packs may contain breeding pair 
young wolves disperse pack second third year find mate pack 
wolves communicate variety ways 
wide array vocalizations including 
express intentions motivational emotional states body posture mother wolf assumes different postures mate 
sense smell integral wolf social behavior scent marking 
wolves social creatures communication central social relationships formed 
pack young adult wolves travel away den hunt carry back meat feed 
return perform stereotypical food behavior crouch front adult lick peck adult 
pup behavior adult meat consume 
wolf social behaviors appear derived behavioral patterns exhibited wolves 
example main types submission wolves exhibit passive submission active submission 
passive submission involves wolf lying side back exposing ventral side chest 
ears held close head tail legs 
behavioral patterns bear resemblance behaviors involved reflex pup mother 
active submission involves posture backward directed ears mouth dominant wolf 
behavior similar behavior described 
similarly dominant behaviors appear form fighting 
chose gray wolf model simulation reasons 
manifest distinct social phenomena complex interesting clear provide direction simulation 
second wolves closely related domestic dog strong conceptual technical base result previous installations done featuring virtual dogs 
social behaviors wolves similar humans lessons learn wolves relevant human social behavior simulation 
computational representations social learning emotion variety computational elements place virtual wolves interact socially way resembling real wolves 
virtual wolves able choose different behaviors move world learn certain interactions lead positive results lead negative repercussions 
components functional parts character building toolkit described 
fundamental representation action system 
consists components action determines action take place determines action cease object action happen

social learning intimately linked ability emotions express emotional states remember association environmental stimuli emotional states 
main extensions system implemented project ability express emotional states ability form context specific emotional memories 
describe elements greater depth 
having emotions order simulate emotional virtual characters necessary choose computational representation captures range emotional phenomena wish characters exhibit 
research done understanding emotions simulating computationally 
darwin ideas emotions form basis modern research understanding emotions scientifically 
project considered main emotional paradigms dimensional approach categorical approach 
dimensional approach maps range emotional phenomena explicitly dimensioned space 
various researchers implemented versions dimensional approach example breazeal maps dimensional space arousal valence stance set emotions influence behavior system motor system 
categorical approach separates emotional phenomena set basic emotions example fear anger sadness happiness disgust surprise 
ekman model provided basis implementation implemented categorical models 
far comprehensive discussion emotional models computational systems reader directed picard book affective computing 
dimensional approach better captured range emotional phenomena wanted wolves display 
emotion model directly pleasure arousal dominance model russell 
moment wolf continuous variables describing dimensional emotional space 
emotional fig 

wolf pup play father categories may mapped axes example anger equivalent low pleasure high arousal high dominance 
value variable affected wolf previous emotional state drift emotional axis undergoes attributes surrounding environment 
currently dominance axis thoroughly fleshed hope elaborate axes coming months 
expressing emotional states emotional state virtual wolves affect action selection mechanism feeding 
example wolf dominance value factor trigger causes occur factor trigger wolf submit 
addition emotional states wolves feed motor control system affect style take actions 
system verbs adverbs system rose action verb taken certain style adverb 
motor control system blend example animations animators need create extreme emotional styles action example high arousal walk low arousal walk get full dynamic expressive range examples 
emotion central creatures social interactions 
context specific emotional memories component real wolf social behavior submissive wolves know submit dominant wolf reaches avoid potentially harmful interaction 
similarly virtual wolves need way triggering submissive behaviors pinned ground dominant individual 
wolves remember previous interactions 
simulation utilize context specific emotional memories purpose 
cause wolf experiencing suite environmental stimuli example dominant wolf return emotional state similar experienced previous encounters stimuli 
addition storing values pleasure arousal dominance wolf feeling experienced relevant stimuli csem features confidence value reflects reliable believes csem values 
continuously changing csem effectively reflects interaction history wolf bit context need specific memories past interactions 
somatic marker hypothesis damasio proposes people attach emotional significance stimuli encounter environment re experience emotion encounter stimuli occasions 
researchers implemented models emotional learning memory example affective tags emotional memories 
important extension system allow wolves form multiple object depending context wolf encountered object 
example wolf pup form csem father father smells meat ll probably food different doesn smell meat ll probably pin ground high values arousal different values pleasure 
social learning development primary area research hope pursue near involves giving wolves ability learn behaviors novel social contexts 
mentioned wolf submission behaviors similar behaviors 
wolves learn behaviors negotiate social relationships 
paragraphs describe elements learning system pertain opting behavior purpose 
previous project entitled virtual duncan ability learn exhibit behavior response appropriate context 
human participant train duncan variety tricks response voice commands 
duncan learning system back propagated value food treat reinforce actions certain time window preceded treat 
addition duncan able distinguish contexts rewarded rewarded propagated value treat contexts reward occurred 
essence mechanism wolves learn perform certain behaviors correct context 
example learning proceed wolves 
imagine pup father wolf eat carcass 
pup gets older father tolerant pup grabbing food away 
certain point father may discipline pup eating close dominating pup 
act continue pup submits escapes 
submission behavior tends cause father wolf pup rapidly learn submit context disciplined 
separate pup stimulus annoyed father wolf 
mechanism pup learn submit flee presence adult 
related behavioral component virtual wolves dominant individuals need willing submissive individual submits 
possibilities include hard coded evolutionary taboo hurting things act learned association submitting individual longer perform action caused dominant distress 
project changing way build characters assembling finished adults creating young certain built behaviors allowing grow social context re modify behaviors purposes 
additional suites behaviors may scheduled come online certain points development 
example sexual maturity new group behaviors eligible expression 
addition changing behaviorally age wolves change anatomically physical forms growing morphing pup adult 
change developmental time scale finding way academic research commercial products
