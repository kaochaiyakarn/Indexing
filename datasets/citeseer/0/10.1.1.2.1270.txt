client asynchrony patterns particular fire forget situations client application needs invoke operation remote object simply notify remote object event 
client expect return value 
reliability invocation critical just notification client server rely 
invoked client proxy sends invocation network returning control caller immediately 
client get acknowledgment remote object receiving invocation 
sync server fire forget useful extreme solution sense client really afford take risk noticing remote invocation reach targeted remote object 
extreme synchronous call client blocked remote method executed successfully response arrives back 
middle extremes needed 
client sends invocation fire forget waits reply server application informing successful reception reception invocation 
reply received client proxy returns control client execution continues 
server application independently executes invocation 
pattern names font 
poll object situations application needs invoke operation asynchronously requires know results invocation 
client necessarily need results immediately continue execution decide returned results 
solution poll objects receive result remote invocations behalf client 
client subsequently uses poll object query result 
just query poll result available block poll object result available 
long result available poll object client continue asynchronously tasks 
result callback client needs actively informed results asynchronously invoked operations remote object 
result available client proxy client wants informed react 
client executes concurrently 
callback interface remote invocations provided client 
invocation client passes result callback object client proxy 
invocation returns immediately sending invocation server 
result available client proxy calls predefined operation callback object passing result invocation
