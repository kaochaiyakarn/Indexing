ontologies agents topics raise particular attention days theoretical application point view 
software gathering service mainly supported ontology agents 
main goal show ontology built distributed heterogeneous software repositories 
particular domain considered software repositories advocate automatic creation global unique ontology versus manual creation multiple ontologies 
keywords ontologies metadata agent technology distributed software retrieval currently great deal interest development ontologies facilitate knowledge sharing general data repositories integration particular 
advocate ontology describe semantically content set data sources containing pieces software 
users deal directly di erent software repositories goal system uses ontology help users retrieve software 
furthermore user requests mapped automatically queries ontology proposed system takes responsibility retrieving installing appropriate software ecient way specialized agents 
frequent tasks computer users obtain new software order improve capabilities computers 
common procedure visit websites contain freeware demos cnet download com games games domain cnet com java related software :10.1.1.101.8349
di erent kinds users need di erent kinds software

kind software interesting users antivirus web browsers summarize main problems users face want obtain new piece software 
know di erent programs ful needs

task complex discourage naive users installing new software 

know features computers order select appropriate version 
task implies having technical knowledge system cpu os version free disk space available ram memory software installed previously requesting full version just update 

aware new software new releases software interest 
commercial programs currently alert new releases users need keep eye web repositories want informed new software interest 
goal alleviating previous problems developed software retrieval service provide users transparent access local remote software sites

users need deal distributed heterogeneous software repositories 
ontology created automatically due context features 
updated easily maintain continuously date 
agents provide interesting features create exploit ontology autonomy mobility 
allow management knowledge solve problems take appropriate decisions
