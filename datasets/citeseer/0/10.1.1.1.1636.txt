probabilistic assessment information extraction web difficult noisy process 
order improve precision knowitall assesses probability extraction generated extractor 
specifically assessor measures occurrence statistics candidate extractions set discriminator phrases 
example cuba actor expect phrase cuba starred prevalent web acted 
starred pattern discriminator phrase 
previous research statistical natural language processing shown occurrence statistics highly informative computed large corpora 
search engine hit counts number results returned response queries cuba starred city means efficiently computing occurrence statistics billions web pages indexed search engines 
mean web scale statistics 
automatically generate discriminator phrases class names keywords extraction rules 
class actor discriminator phrases instance term occurs adjacent class name actor keyword phrase extraction rule 
example discriminator actors candidate instance replaces discriminator phrase 
underlying intuition web scale statistics hit counts discriminator phrases feature helps distinguish instances class non instances 
machine learning researchers long understood choice appropriate features matters particular learning algorithm employed 
fact exact choice features assessment subtle evaluated possibilities experience section 
aware hit counts quite inaccurate useful practice 
incorporating nutch knowitall compare quality statistics obtained commercial search engines returned nutch computed smaller portion web 
addition incorporating techniques learning new discriminators 
rule pattern constraints bindings keywords pattern context slot context slot context context string slot np digit constraints constr constr phrase string phrase phrase np head np head bindings instanceof class phrase instanceof class phrase instanceof class phrase pred phrase phrase class string pred string keywords keywords string bnf description extraction rule language 
extraction pattern alternates context exact string match slots simple noun phrase np list nps arbitrary phrase 
constraints may require phrase head match exact string proper noun 
operator applies constraint simple np 
rule bindings specify extracted phrases bound predicate arguments 
keywords formed literals rule sent queries search engines 
features chosen combined naive bayesian probability update 
observed features 
fn assumed conditionally independent assessor uses equation calculate expected truth atomic formula 
fn fi fi fi equation prior probability fact 
expression fi denotes probability observing feature fi fact true fi denotes probability observing feature fi true 
denominator equation normalizes probability 
naive bayesian classifier matters fact true false classified true 
operating information retrieval context wish able trade precision recall 
record numeric probability values extracted facts raising threshold required fact deemed true increase precision decrease recall lowering threshold opposite effect 
naive bayes formula notorious producing polarized probability estimates close zero estimated probabilities inaccurate 
points classifier surprisingly effective needs ordinal judgment class classify instances correctly 
similarly formula produces reasonable ordering likelihood extracted facts class 
ordering sufficient knowitall implement desired precision recall tradeoff 
discriminator phrases validate binary predicates 
binary discriminator includes argument values instance phrase possibly additional terms 
example predicate stars actor film discriminators simply replaced actor name film 
phrases harrison ford star wars harrison ford star wars relatively high hit counts harrison ford park harrison ford prior probability function extraction rule previous success producing high probability instances

achieve goal rely bootstrapping technique induces seeds generic extraction patterns automatically generated discriminator phrases 
bootstrapping begins instantiating set extraction rules queries predicate generic rule templates generates set discriminator phrases keyword phrases rules class names 
best supply system names class country nation class country 
compensates inherent ambiguity single name country music genre refer instances high mutual information country nation desired semantic class 
bootstrapping selects seeds running extraction cycle find set proposed instances class selecting instances highest average pmi
