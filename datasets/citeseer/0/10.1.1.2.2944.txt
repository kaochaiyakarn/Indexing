context information ubiquitous computing environments particular characteristics provide challenges undertaking context management 
firstly information compose context environments broad come variety heterogeneous sources 
considering ubiquitous elearning scenario user name age address native language current location learning style compose part context 
similarly people sharing room working office considered part context information current temperature lighting conditions 
system context management able cope information large variety heterogeneous sources provide information 
information considered context information point view entity ubiquitous computing environment little information discard irrelevant

devices seamlessly integrate computing environment users efficient 
environment roaming user device norm exception
