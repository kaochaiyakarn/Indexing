approach system uses swarm intelligence 
swarm approach promising dealing massive data extremely distributed nature swarm architectures corresponding potential parallel processing 
swarm systems modeled ants social insects 
numerous relatively simple agents decisions response local environments 
coordinated action emerges desired behavior remarkably intelligent collective scale 
stigmergy coordination changes shared environment key efficient swarm behavior 
agents achieve stigmergy special markers pheromones chemicals propagate shared space evaporate 
stigmergy result agents respond directly changes shared environment effected agents called stigmergy 
apply swarm intelligence hypothesis corroboration requires breaking new ground field swarming multi agent systems 
ant caf combines multiple swarming mechanisms single system utilizing digital pheromones stigmergy 
processes include clustering text yield orderly space identifying relations text yield matches assembly matches structures instantiate hypotheses
