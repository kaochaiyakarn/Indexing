past decade goal models computer science order represent software requirements business objectives design qualities 
models extend traditional ai planning techniques representing goals allowing partially defined possibly inconsistent goals 
presents formal framework reasoning goal models 
particular proposes qualitative numerical axiomatization goal modeling primitives introduces label propagation algorithms shown sound complete respect respective axiomatizations 
addition reports preliminary experimental results propagation algorithms applied goal model car manufacturer 
concept goal areas computer science quite time 
ai goals planning describe desirable states world 
goals software engineering model early requirements non functional requirements software system 
instance early requirement library information system book request eventually fulfilled new system highly reliable example non functional requirement 
goals useful knowledge management systems focus strategic knowledge increase profits largest auto manufacturer north america 
traditional goal analysis consists decomposing goals subgoals decomposition 
goal decomposed respectively decomposed subgoals 
gn subgoals satisfied goal goal model consisting goals relationships set initial labels nodes greg mcarthur sharing version goal model car manufacturing 
anonymous reviewers greg mcarthur helpful feedback earlier drafts 
giorgini mylopoulos sebastiani graph satisfied denied simple label propagation algorithm generate labels nodes graph 
unfortunately simple framework modeling analyzing goals won domains goals formalizable relationships captured semantically defined relations ones 
example goals highly reliable system formally defined predicate prescribes meaning may want define necessary conditions goal satisfied 
goal may related goals thoroughly debugged system thoroughly tested system sense obviously contribute satisfaction contribution partial qualitative 
words goals satisfied certainly contribute satisfaction goal don guarantee satisfaction 
framework situations contradictory contributions goal 
instance may want allow multiple decompositions goal sets subgoals decompositions suggest satisfaction suggest denial 
interested modeling framework goals allows qualitative goal relationships accommodate contradictory situations 
accomplish introducing goal relationships labelled model respectively situation goal contributes positively negatively satisfaction goal 
major problem arises extension giving precise semantics new goal relationships 
accomplished different ways 
section offer qualitative formalization label propagation algorithm shown sound complete respect formalization 
section offer quantitative semantics new relationships probabilistic model label propagation algorithm shown sound complete 
section presents preliminary experimental results label propagation algorithms section summarizes contributions sketches directions research 
example suppose modeling strategic objectives car manufacturer ford gm 
examples objectives increase return investment increase customer loyalty 
objectives represented goals analyzed goal relationships 
addition respectively binary goal relationship satisfaction implies satisfaction denial 
instance increase return investment may decomposed increase sales volume increase profit vehicle 
likewise increase sales volume decomposed increase consumer appeal expand markets 
decomposition refinement goals continue goals tangible satisfy appropriate course increase vw sales lower gas price gas price rises increase toyota sales reduce operating costs increase expand increase consumer appeal markets sales price improve mileage gas price rises lower environment impact japanese gas price rises increase sales volume offer lower purchase costs lower jap 
interest rates japanese rates rise yen rises increase return investment gm lower loan rates reasoning goal analysis lower sales price increase profit vehicle increase foreign earnings increase customer loyalty improve car quality lower production costs keep labour costs low fig 

partial goal model gm 
improve economies production improve car services increase high margin sales reduce raw outsource materials units costs production action observable confirmed satisfied denied simply observing application domain 
vaguely stated goals increase customer loyalty may want simply model relevant goals improve car quality improve car services relate relationships shown 
goals may influence positively negatively goals introduced analysis goal increase return investment 
lateral goal relationships may introduce cycles goal models 
examples observable goals yen rises gas prices rise goal satisfied call event kind event may read news story represent graphical notation rectangle see lower portion 
shows partial fictitious goal model gm focusing goal increase return investment 
order increase return investment gm satisfy goals increase sales increase profit vehicle 
turn increase sales volume decomposed increase consumer appeal expand markets goal increase profit vehicle decomposed increase sales price lower production costs increase foreign earnings increase high margin sales 
additional decompositions shown 
instance goal increase consumer appeal satisfied satisfying lower environment impact trying lower purchase costs reducing vehicle operating costs reduce operating costs 
giorgini mylopoulos sebastiani graph shows lateral relationships goals 
example goal increase customer loyalty positive contributions goals lower environment impact improve car quality improve car services negative contribution increase sales price 
root goal increase return investment gm related goals concerning auto manufacturer toyota vw 
particular gm increases sales toyota loses share north american market toyota increases sales increase toyota sales expense vw vw increases sales increase vw sales expense gm 
far assumed goal relationship treats dual fashion 
instance satisfied partially satisfied dually denied partially denied 
note goal relationship applies 
particular contribution increase sales gm increase sales toyota applies increase sales gm satisfied gm hasn increased sales doesn mean toyota
