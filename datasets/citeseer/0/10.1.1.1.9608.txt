combining textual visual cues content image retrieval world wide web marco la cascia sethi stan sclaroff image video computing group computer science department boston university boston ma system proposed combines textual visual statistics single index vector content search www image database 
textual statistics captured vector form latent semantic indexing lsi text containing html document 
visual statistics captured vector form color orientation histograms 
integrated approach possible take advantage possible statistical couplings content document latent semantic content contents images visual statistics 
combined approach allows improved performance conducting content search 
search performance experiments reported database containing images collected www 
growing importance world wide web led birth number image search engines :10.1.1.44.4418:10.1.1.1.7543
web staggering scale puts severe limitations types indexing algorithms employed 
luckily due scale unstructured nature www basic indexing tools welcome 
existing image engines allow users search images sql keywords interface query image example qbe :10.1.1.44.4418
qbe system presents initial page representative randomly selected images thumbnails user 
user marks images relevant search 
visual statistics images defining query 
user success locating images database depends great part images appear initial group thumbnails 
numerous diverse images available www index difficult guarantee relevant image shown initial page 
call page zero problem 
www image engines allow user form query terms sql keywords :10.1.1.44.4418
alleviates page zero problem user give text information narrows scope possible images displayed page zero 
build image index keywords extracted heuristically html documents containing image image url 
unfortunately difficult include visual cues sql framework 
results systems force inherently visual information textual form systems treat textual visual cues 
new approach truly unifying textual visual statistics expect get better results separately 
propose approach allows combination visual statistics textual statistics vector space representation commonly query image content systems 
text statistics captured vector form latent semantic indexing lsi 
text documents represented low dimensional vectors matched user queries lsi semantic space 
lsi index html document associated images contained 
visual statistics color orientedness computed image 
lsi vector visual statistics vector combined unified vector content search resulting image database 
previous systems visual information form compatible standard dbms frameworks refine query :10.1.1.44.4418
integrated approach able take advantage possible statistical couplings content document latent semantic content contents images image statistics furthermore lsi implicitly addresses problems synonyms word sense lexical matching term omission 
html tags weights alt field img title em strong tag table word weights html tags 
latent semantic indexing context image appears abstracted containing html document method known information retrieval community latent semantic indexing lsi 
lsi works statistically associating related words conceptual context document

html document parsed word frequency histogram computed 
documents database similar length structure 
words html document may equally relevant document context 
words appearing specific html tags special importance assigning higher weight compared words document 
system assigns different weights words appearing title headers alt fields img tags words emphasized different fonts bold italics 
see table 
weight values fixed likelihood useful information may implied text 
weighting selectively words appearing various html tags helps emphasizing underlying information document 
different weighting scheme :10.1.1.44.4418
addition words appearing particular image assigned weight proximity image 
weighting value computed ae gamma pos dist pos position word respect image dist maximum number words considered apply weighting 
current implementation dist words appearing image respectively 
ae fixed words nearest images get weighted slightly words appearing alt field image title url 
images appearing different locations html document different lsi indices

svd derives set uncorrelated indexing factors term image represented vector space sigma gamma resulting lsi vector provides context associated image combined computed visual feature vectors stored database index 
integration visual statistics visual statistics describe image color histogram dominant orientation histogram :10.1.1.1.7543
potential number images index fundamental importance dimension feature vector small possible 
pointed white jain visual data intrinsic dimension significantly smaller original dimension 
principal component analysis pca subvector space color directionality allows dramatically reduce dimension visual features small loss information :10.1.1.1.7543
global feature vector representing content image composite subvectors dimensionally reduced color histogram orientation histogram overlapping image regions lsi descriptor described :10.1.1.1.7543
image described vector query example problem easily formulated nearest neighbor 
approach slightly different 
allow user query system examples additional information coming multiple selection allow relevance feedback 
relevance feedback relevance feedback enables user iteratively refine query specification relevant items 
including user loop better search performance achieved 
typically system returns set possible matches user gives feedback marking items relevant relevant 
user specified relevant images system infer combination measures 
imagerover system employs relevance feedback algorithm selects appropriate lm minkowski distance metrics fly 
algorithm determines relative weightings individual features feedback images 
weighting varies depending particular selections user
