samples annotated training data set manually defined rules 
experiments carried different hmm architectures

architectures follows 
naive approach inspired represented semantic slot single target state 
additionally defined prefix suffix state slot responsible modelling typical left right contexts 
single shared background state producing uninteresting data 
model topology shown fig 
contrary independent models built slot created single model containing slots hope capturing characteristic inter slot positioning price typically name

prefix suffix states slot directly labelled data treated preceding tokens emitted states experiments

state structure transition distributions remained unchanged compared naive model 
experiments word trigram models selected slots trained particular slot training data smoothed linear interpolation weights obtained em algorithm described obtain best state sequence observed tokens wn model simple modification abovementioned viterbi algorithm designed 

third approach experimented previously learnt hmm submodel semantic slot having significant internal structure

results table name price slots obtained naive word gram submodel approaches respectively 
remaining slots exhibit significant internal structure currently results just naive model 
precision recall lexical probabilities conditioned previous words provided previous states current state 
note need em algorithm naive approach weights obtained directly training data 
state submodel trained bike name measured token basis 
results obtained fold cross validation set labelled documents values averaged 
non naive approaches modelling slot values suffer data sparseness probably causes degradation precision cases

instance composition size data acceptable training hmms discovery individual slots bike name price picture need data learn compose instances product offers task terminology characterised template extraction 
clearly task extraction effort sensible 
approximation toy algorithm grouping labels produced annotation 
algorithm processes annotations sequentially exploits information required optional slots allowed cardinality defined means tiny presentation ontology essentially slot annotated item added currently assembled bike instance cause inconsistency current instance saved new instance created accomodate slot slots 
despite acceptable performance hand annotated training data algorithm correctly groups names prices baseline approach achieves poor results data average corresponding names prices matched properly trivial reasons 
plan replace toy algorithm sophisticated version reasonably robust automatically annotated data 
critical problems baseline algorithm connected missing slots multiple different slot transposed tables partial solutions suggested research reused
