mediation architecture sail api design sesame allows persistent storage rdf data schema information subsequent querying information 
sesame needs scalable repository 
logical choice repository dbms large number dbms developed having strengths weaknesses targeted platforms api 
dbms rdf data stored numerous ways 
depending application domain forms persistent storage may suitable example storage main memory files external source 
keep sesame architecture independent actual choice repository storage specific code concentrated single architectural layer sesame storage inference layer sail 
sail java application programming interface api offers rdf specific methods clients translates methods calls specific repository 
important advantage lets build sesame top wide variety repositories changing sesame components
