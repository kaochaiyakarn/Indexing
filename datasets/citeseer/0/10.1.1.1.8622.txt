currently supported implementation described section just known porter stemming algorithm simple means normalizing natural language terms 
preprocessing similar strategies resource processing module transforms data algorithm specific relational representation 
algorithm library ontology may described sets concepts relations lexical entries links entities 
ontology may built specification various algorithms working preprocessed input data 
different algorithms may generate definitions overlapping complementary ontology parts 
instance information extraction module specialized processing maedche staab may find subclass relationships similar classification statistical techniques knn cf 
machine learning association rules may detect general binary relationships 
may reuse algorithms library acquiring different parts ontology definition 
subsequently introduce algorithms available implementation 
general result combination approach algorithm provided library generates normalized results follow ontology structures sketched contributes coherent ontology definition 
research needed overlapping results may contribute common result really multi strategy learning fashion 
ontology learning algorithms example learning algorithms described

lexical entry concept extraction simple technique extracting relevant lexical entries may indicate concepts counting frequencies terms set linguistically preprocessed documents corpus 
general approach assumption frequent term set domain specific texts indicates occurrence relevant concept 
research information retrieval shown effective methods term weighting simple counting frequencies 
standard information retrieval approach pursued term weighting measures 
lexical entry frequency lef frequency occurrence lexical entry document 
document frequency df number documents corpus occurs 
corpus frequency cf total number occurrences corpus 
reader may note df cf lef cf 
relevance terms measured information retrieval measure tfidf term frequency inverted document frequency 
definition 
lef term frequency lexical entry document 
df document frequency lexical entry 
tfidf lexical entry document example apposition sentence 
typical japanese accomodation 
accomodation apposition superconcept 
tfidf lef ontology learning df tfidf weighs frequency lexical entry document factor discounts importance appears documents 
terms appear rarely frequently ranked lower terms hold balance 
rank importance term document corpus tfidf values lexical entries computed follows definition 
tfidf tfidf tfidf user may define vary threshold tfidf exceed 
threshold explore terms corpus inclusion set lexical entries possibly concept hierarchy 
extraction taxonomic relations extraction taxonomic relations may done various ways 
framework mainly include kinds approaches statistics extraction clustering statistics extraction classification lexico syntactic pattern extraction shortly elaborate approaches 
clustering distributional data words may build concepts embedding hierarchy scratch clustering mechanisms 
distributional representation describes term weighted frequency terms occur delineated context 
delineation may defined sequential vicinity terms terms appear represented representing term syntactic delineation terms may syntactic dependency represented term text structural criterion terms appear paragraph delineated html tags 
clustering defined process organizing objects groups members similar way distributional representation see 
general major styles clustering 
agglomerative initialization phase term defined constitute cluster 
growing phase larger clusters iteratively generated merging similar dissimilar ones stopping criterion reached 
list stopwords excluded 
maedche staab 
partitional initialization phase set terms cluster 
refinement phase smaller clusters iteratively generated splitting largest cluster homogeneous cluster subclusters 
agglomerative partitional clustering techniques produce hierarchical descriptions terms 
rely notions dis similarity range measures exist kullback leibler divergence norm cosine cf 

practice partitional clustering means clustering technique faster performed runtime compared agglomerative techniques number represented terms 

conceptual conceptual clustering builds lattice terms investigating exact overlap representing terms represented terms 
worst case complexity resulting concept lattice exponential 
people just compute sublattice heuristics 
way may construct hierarchy term clusters detailed inspection ontology engineer 
classification substantial hierarchy basic level categories general resource wordnet may decide refine taxonomy classifying new relevant terms concept hierarchy 
distributional representation described learn classifier training corpus set predefined concepts lexical entries 
may construct distributional representations relevant unclassified terms learned classifier propose node subclass new term cf 
nearest neighbor knn support vector machines typical learning algorithms exploited purpose 
lexico syntactic patterns idea lexico syntactic patterns form regular expressions extraction semantic relations particular taxonomic relationships introduced :10.1.1.36.701
pattern approaches general heuristic methods regular expressions originally successfully applied area information extraction 
lexico syntactic ontology learning approach text scanned instances distinguished lexico syntactic patterns indicate relation interest taxonomy 
underlying idea simple define regular expression captures re occurring expressions map results matching expression semantic structure taxonomic relations concepts 
example lexico syntactic pattern considered ontology learning apply pattern sentence np referring concepts left sub concepts np referring concept right 
example sentence broken bones injuries common 
extract taxonomic relations injury wound injury broken bone injury 
ontology learning system applied different techniques dictionary definitions context insurance telecommunication domains described

companies interested mining association rules databases helping business decisions customer relationship management loss leader analysis 
typical example association rule mining market basket analysis 
process analyzes customer buying habits finding associations different items customers place shopping baskets 
information discovered association rules may help develop marketing strategies layout optimization supermarkets placing milk bread close proximity may encourage sale items single visits store
