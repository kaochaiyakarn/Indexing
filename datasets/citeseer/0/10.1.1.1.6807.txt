participants asked pc connected internet interview 
interviews semi structured

web 
sure web click 
wide range internet technology experience interviewed users little knowledge computer systems 
value internet users little technical knowledge required 
need install particular programs access particular service web sites available web browser 
point particularly worth emphasising computers 
installation software individuals machines closely limited controlled support staff 
web sites accessed standard software need install host machine 
internet services computers common installing software computers problematic 
ease web services meant web browsing activity easily incorporated activities 
participants particular talked web browsing way relaxing break 
day users took break tasks internet 
interestingly form internet browsing descriptions internet browsing received generally tended near random surfing web pages interest tended focused particular activities checking bank balance checking prices particular item interested buying browse internet 

normally trying find particular piece information 
internet appeared fit working day part individuals daily routines 
example users browsed web set times say morning lunch time go internet 
possible 
time get bored generally quickly get go home 
tend surf thing morning specific things just general depending day bit afternoon 
home users internet sessions motivated particular activity 
user decide grocery shopping try web site friend recommended complete bank transfer 
interestingly going online rarely described leisure activity purposeful way completing specific task lot times purpose time purposeful 
moment doing lot travel stuff going asia months purpose things call fun 
admit time purpose don tend surf fun 
popular description web surfing slightly misleading description users web usage emphasises random enjoyable aspects web specific tasks users wished carry 
managing structuring favourite web sites expected large variety type number web pages users visited 
previous studies mainly categorised web pages content context attardi sebastiani 
interview data study alternative categorisation terms frequency access 
way web pages roughly structured types 
firstly pages check morning regular sites users visited news web sites 
second category users check sporadically time sites content changed week 
third category pages users visited need specific find specific information purchase book consult train time 
frequency sites visited varied task frequently user needed task 
fourth category sites participants spoke exploring coming searching accident 
example user checked bbc news web page online bank day 
days went com features web site aimed women read articles jungle com consult prices new computer equipment 
specifically needed buy cd happen months go amazon past 
wanting buy player search google find review opinions com 
browse opinions add favourites way web site moves discovered page site go back looking specific information 
way web sites discovered sites move different categories users interests changed morning 
check bank account 
money 
check bbc everyday check bbc bristol yahoo check mail account lots websites fantastic 
plot year looking buying house got mortgage companies 
said tracking web sites seen highly ordered activity 
fact users management web pages fairly chaotic problematic 
users generally kept track sites methods keep sites favourites search browser history attempt guess service name web sites put favourites 
don pop put name 
favourites bookmarks list explorer netscape sufficient tracking web sites number key failings 
terms managing list keeping list sort order involves considerable effort moving favourites individual folders 
list soon expands unmanageable length 
favourites list keeps name site list making difficult differentiate different sites quickly 
easy forget put favourites 
putting site favourites increases list size search considerable incentive put sites favourites lists 
multiple machines list favourites tied particular machine 
means web site wrong place address bookmarked wrong machine 
users worked problems number ways 
users abandoned favourites altogether resorted history mechanism browser 
typing name site history matching mechanism usually find web site address looking 
users attempt guess web sites memory usually putting www com name obviously sites 
ironically way favourites mechanisms worked encouraged users bookmark sites visited 
sites users forget 
favourites mechanism fails help users track sites occasionally visit looking specific item 
participant resorted writing small book web sites wanted remember mechanism reliable portable favourites mechanism explorer 
managing current list web sites finding new web sites fairly haphazard activity users 
major sources finding new web sites press magazines newspapers friends search engines 
despite attempts search engines yahoo 
google searching web sites specifically problematic 
example find garden plant retailer straightforward internet human indexed systems yahoo 
suggests area approached systematically technology 
specifically systems watch user web browsing suggest new web sites interested 
approach taken system chalmers 
collaborative filtering problem fairly straightforward particularly preference data recorded online form web searching histories 
meta task problem broader problem tasks participants wanted carry usually level specific web site 
example participant wanted plan trip france england car 
involved going number different web sites 
firstly looked different costs crossing channel england france 
worked distances different ferry ports town wanted visit 
worked cost knowledge current french prices 
adding bits information worked cheapest fastest way get car france 
straightforward task involved visiting different web sites consulting car atlas number travel notes information combining get information needed 
tasks users spoke required browsing numerous web sites combining information 
obviously way shopping internet spanned multiple web sites 
prices need compared web sites information different web sites varies quality 
example amazon excels terms user reviews cd music samples available 
past tasks carried expert intermediaries 
case travel example travel agent collect information different sources combine 
suggests opportunities electronic intermediaries automatically pull information different sources different possible solutions 
example image web site put different towns web site application possible routes 
fairly straightforward example demonstrate users tasks sit level individual web site 
manifestation web sites address problem idea price comparison web site search prices product 
web sites currently fail integrate purchase actual web site lose main profit source intermediary 
travel agent example want go direct airline lose commission 
price comparisons specific example general problem individuals tasks web sites 
problems internet shopping trust risk observations move consider participants experience shopping online 
increasingly common activity general web browsing internet shopping suffers poor usability web sites see example nielsen nielsen 
furthermore shopping task exists meta level level individual shops sites described 
despite problems internet shopping offer convenient advantages 
part shopping online cuts travel time involved visiting physical shop 
elimination travel time means shopping carried times shopping normally impractical bricks mortar shops closed 
course time shop reduced time obtaining goods increased goods delivered 
goods able view handle actual product limits shopping experience 
issue returning goods involved online offline 
comments reflect points view shop internet 
complete laziness 
couldn bothered get bus carry shopping back get 
bought clothes online 
doesn appeal see buying 
shop internet 
time 
factors internet shopping offers important price advantage 
internet retailers sell items lower cost lower overheads theory 
means items online shopping mail order shopping attract consumers cost important factor 
cost factors described influence individual consumers different ways 
people interviewed searching cheapest price go extent checking numerous web sites online stores purchase get lot choice cheaper 
aol amazon competing re lot cheaper buy shop anyway 
users relatively cost insensitive stick web site knew 
similar behaviour conventional shopping 
price internet retailers offer ability purchase items rare specialist interest 
speciality items example particular type football scarf hard track normally web ordered shipped overseas 
internet shopping particularly medium specialist purchases bought husband gift christmas road things interesting net quicker 
look gun produces real looking gun 
bought hong kong 
air looks real got online man runs air store told web site went online arrived weeks 
internet shopping problems regard issues trust privacy 
established major challenges internet shopping research 
important aspect trust online nature risk terms actual damage spam mail financial time cost perceived loss privacy 
participants spoke internet shopping just started cautious risk online 
talked stupid shopping online media reports fraud 
issues regarding security online highly technical individuals explained difficult know internet particular sites secure 
despite experiences friends colleagues encouraged show interest shopping online consider experimenting making purchases see happens don buy things online shopping sites 
find need know web ll phone person largely having card number floating 
think probably sat explained type safety precautions 
day dan explained safety precautions sites amazon told 
hear horror stories 
certainly think giving online shopping go couple weeks 
experienced internet shoppers shared shopping online 
appear prevented shopping online am bit wary giving credit card number away instance buying online ticket beneficial took chance 
steal details proof got haven physically got ticket hand haven physically got receipt hand saw get airport tickets don arrive know get hold person say taken money sort detachment service provider 
having said book flights internet cheaper 
don feel bad security online started shopping net 
frightened think bought thought oh going get masses people bills cards things 
problem 
participants attempting judgements regarding risks involved actions 
media reports obviously effect judgements views friends colleagues rank higher personal experience highest 
finding confirmed studies perceptions risk new technology se 
individuals internet shopping find experience immediate problems judgement risk online shopping decreases 
causes factors described convenience cost dominate decisions 
judgement risk appears generally attached new media technology shopping internet 
example participants compared having credit card details stored wallet having details stored computer 
physical wallet individuals know control computer wallet unknown easily controlled 
participants asked computer storing credit card details considerable hesitation feel computer stored personal information gave web sites asked 
probably little concerned got sons just case able access things wouldn want 
important question ask point fear risk risk 
main forms risk internet risk damage risk loss privacy 
potential damage fairly straightforward 
take form credit card fraud delivery goods spam messages sent mail address 
direct credit card fraud covered cards gaining refund take considerable time effort 
discussed problems security online damage items immediately obvious individuals interviewed normally tick box don want things passed 
stand junk mail 
encouragement interviewees admitted worried privacy described general terms tend give personal details really expect phone number earth give phone number re dealing net 
think worried got access information 
doubt existence big brother unfortunately quite worrying think information web shopping habits food eat cigarettes buy 
feel companies tracking internet 
bit big brother don really 
doesn doing 
really wanted brush aside slightly 
don know different just general people know 
individuals describe general fear big brother having privacy perfectly willing give personal details long advantage 
way explored issue privacy generally trust bring topic supermarket loyalty cards 
cards supplied number supermarkets allow owner small discount shopping exchange card time shop 
loyalty card supermarket link individuals specific purchases statistical techniques learn customers behaviour 
sense loyalty card shopper exchanges privacy discount shopping 
brought topic loyalty cards asked participants compare card felt online shopping shopping data 
participants sort loyalty card making purchases conventional stores 
previously complained privacy appeared happy shopping tracked loyalty card loyalty cards boots get points 
oh get lots name got bp argos boots 
mind shop track re buying 
want single person couple store loyalty cards going happen anyway world re tracked cameras going happen anyway 
store card food isn 
mean information going get food buy 
discounts get give information 
presents paradox participants willing volunteer information general worries privacy 
turn willing lose privacy little gain 
number possible solutions paradox 
firstly may issue control important 
shown number studies privacy controlling visibility important issue users privacy protection bellotti sellen 
internet possible users perceive little control details contributes concerns 
secondly possible details held loyalty cards supermarket purchases considered trivial unimportant 
personal details transmitted internet bank statements may cause concern 
complex answer may participants feel concerned issues terms appearing reasonable individuals practice issues may influence practice 
similar hidden voting effect surveys voting intention individuals hide true voting preferences say think voting 
case takes form individuals feeling concerned privacy pay money put effort protecting privacy 
investigating issue difficult methodologies declared actual activity suffer problem 
design implications mentioned study explorative aimed generating data assist design new web technologies 
findings generate new concepts technologies assist users web 
concepts generated currently implementing home page favourites web clipping web card 
home page favourites concept creating new home page user favourites list 
application built user favourite web pages scanned converted web page 
item favourites list thumbnail web page inserted web page name 
page user home page page appears user runs browser 
access favourite user needs click name thumbnail web page 
example page shown showing current favourite display microsoft internet explorer 
favourites displayed microsoft explorer menu displaying user favourites way attempt address difficulties users managing accessing favourites 
system developed displays larger thumbnail web page tool tip mouse pauses particular page 
showing thumbnails page user able find page favourites easily recognising web page see example woodruff thumbnails web pages 
dimensions layout available page allows favourites displayed larger area 
favourites displayed home page favourites thumbnails web page 
mouse apple thumbnail preview web page displayed 
screen just list contained menu gives advantages users 
firstly space taken favourites screen enabling longer list favourites scrolling 
currently experimenting optimum size icon possible see double amount favourites available menu list scrolling thumbnails page 
second advantage users remember position particular favourites page 
example user remember favourite bottom right page start looking page 
placing favourites page page loaded browser opened speeds getting particular favourite need access favourites menu opening browser skipped 
user need click favourite need soon displayed 
implementation extremely simple idea discount value users 
comments users interviewed suggests allowing users quickly access favourites small important way improve web experience 
developing system allow rearranging favourites home page home page completely replaces favourites menu 
web clipping second concept addresses issues arise meta task problem discussed 
meta task problem arises information needed users distributed multiple web sites web pages 
system user clip web page area storage simply pressing button web browser taskbar 
copy web page quickly recovered browser saved allowing user quickly clip number pages having wait 
web clipping feature building allows section web page selected stored 
way user clip section web page interested say price details need refer 
system allows information clipped browsed compare extract information needed 
functionality available limited form macintosh version internet explorer called web 
web pages saved disk netscape windows version internet explorer 
techniques limitations directly address meta task problem 
macintosh internet explorer web web page viewed time making difficult compare information pages 
windows platform saving web pages page named saving page take considerable amount time 
web clipping trivial application technically certainly straightforward implement believe addresses number problems discussed users 
allowing different information quickly clipped information compared date side side 
current methods clipping information web pages involve writing information clipboard copy paste details web pages attendant problems 
particular copying pasting eliminates specific formatting web pages necessitates keeping document open information collected 
feature described means simply easier collect web information 
web card final concept aimed addressing concerns users spoke regard security online specifically perceptions risk 
physical card sent customers particular online retailer request usually user requests additional security 
looking credit store card card allows user shop online retailer combination id password particular user account 
online purchase user needs supply number web card id password 
idea may trivial technically addresses number concerns users volunteered interviews 
prominently system allows users judge risk associated online purchases 
users cards purchases 
purchasing online adds level technical detail difficult users judge risks involved purchasing online turn leads uncertainty shopping online 
having physical card users judge risk involved analogy physical credit cards 
card tied particular online account risks involved theft losing card reduced id password stolen 
course concept little directly improve online security technically card role 
web card allows users reason risk involved shopping online feel secure ownership physical card 
number similarities web card store loyalty cards discussed study participants 
cases physical artefact retailer attempts connection customer 
customers comfortable having shopping purchases recorded loyalty cards analogy comfortable having purchases recorded online 
way privacy concerns shopping online may mitigated issuing web card 
attempt allow users reason risk privacy analogies existing products loyalty cards familiar 
reviewed practices surrounding internet range different activities 
different activities underline popularity internet moving general population 
technological concern online world general public concerns 
denying example sharing music napster worldwide public event technological 
qualitative interviews generate understandings users organise web 
data interviews look web began fit individuals lives terms leisure 
obviously results possible cultural bias 
interviewed relatively small group individuals 
aim study explore details web users draw strong general web 
exploratory study results taken start understanding web depth 
said understandings kind specifically generating new concepts 
demonstrated concepts discussed 
concepts described favourites home page web clipping web card address problems concerns users directly expressed 
development grounded user experiences technical advancement 
suggest improves chances concepts improving users experiences simply technology technology sake 
concepts simple innovations 
simplicity web part success successful innovation follow simplicity 
aim build large systems add level complexity 
web increasingly prevalent believe simple concepts bring greatest benefit users
