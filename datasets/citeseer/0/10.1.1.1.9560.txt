section describes iv requirements support tasks 
mentioned earlier current iv tools focus solely monitoring phase consider entire id process 
information visualization requirements phase monitoring simple displays participants preferred simple displays phase allow continuous monitoring need focused attention building pre attentive visual processing fast parallel recognition color shape movement humans 
visualization support phase provide starting point recognizing flagging events require analysis way done quickly effectively requiring analysts full attention 
overview displays data visualization attributes similar findings displaying overview current activity essential 
participant told people want big picture graphical overviews serve purpose 
attributes popular ids snort ids similar attributes alerts shown table 
participants asked select important data attributes include visualization displays 
general agreement attributes shown bold date time considered important 
attributes suited provide overview monitoring phase

ids alert data attributes overview display flexibility need user iv displays important finding monitoring analysis phases 
described id requires deep understanding idiosyncratic local networks 
analysts configure ids order identify attacks unique network 
flexibility reflected visualization displays 
participants favor ability set visualization display settings object added effort voiced need saving settings able reuse 
phase analysis diagnosis filtering interaction monitoring tools require little user interaction possible supporting analysis interactive activity 
due large size data sets filtering important function iv tools id transitional mechanism monitoring analysis 
multiple discrete ranges need selected predefined user defined clusters able saved reused complex displays 
addition filtering data provide means highlighting data necessarily removing display data focus task important providing vital contextual information correctly diagnosing alert 
exploration analysis diagnosis task requires support user exploration warrants markedly different iv displays monitoring 
need simplistic displays quickly identifying alert monitoring replaced need powerful visualizations represent multidimensional data multiple sources 
multiple data sources correlation analysis diagnosis alert accomplished account secondary data sources supplement information contained alert 
visualization tool effectively fuse disparate data sources seamlessly single display correlate data 
example host information determines target attack vulnerable attack described alert 
breadth data sources depend organization include dynamically collected static network level host level data 
multiple views levels data phase ability multiple views related data important 
analysts utilize multiple displays time multiple displays running visualization tool data different data attributes different time spans displayed 
important need display levels data network sessions raw packets host information allow users drill zoom certain data items 
phase response support necessary responding attacks extends iv displays data manipulation viewing 
ability save views keep histories exploration activity annotating alerts help analysts document report incidents 
functions missing iv tools allow users transition exploring finding information reusing information 
suggesting possible responses different types attacks greatly aid speed efficiency responding attacks suggestions come annotations previously diagnosed similar attacks ids developers
