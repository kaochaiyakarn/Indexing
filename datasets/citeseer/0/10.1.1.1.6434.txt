adaptive user interface generation section discuss alternatives generate adaptive user interface allowing monitoring user behavior 

option visitor agent creates gui approach visitor agent arrives user device queries user agent available resources user preferences device capabilities 
visitor agent creates gui interacts user directly 
approach solves generation customised gui problems 
user agent monitor user behavior data provided gui flows directly visitor agent 

user agent trust visitor agent render gui user preferences device capabilities 
visitor agents ignore user agent descriptions show gui directly 

visitor agents know process apply knowledge provided user agent implies know generate kind gui 

option user agent creates gui visitor agent handles events approach visitor agent arriving user device provides user agent specification needed gui 
user agent generates gui user preferences device capabilities visitor agent requirements delegates gui event handling visitor agent 
advantages approach user agent guarantees guis visitor agents generated correctly user preferences device capabilities specified xul 
visitor agents need know generate guis different devices 
user agent deny permission generate gui visitor agents order avoid direct gui generation :10.1.1.19.4138
approach user agent monitor user behavior gui events handled directly visitor agents 
user agent trust visitor agent get information interaction user 

option intermediate agent creates gui handles events approach visitor agent sends xul specification gui user agent second user agent generates gui handles events receives data user sends user data back visitor agent 
approach advantages approaches 
furthermore allows user agent monitor user behavior easily efficiently handles gui events 
approach interesting implementation faces problem user agent attend different services executed user device tasks gui generation overload 
better approach user agent delegates generation adaptive guis specialised agent adus 
distribution service execution agents adus agent user agent visitor agent allows balance distribute workload system 

indirect generation gui section describe detail architecture needed efficiently generation adaptive guis 
application sample illustrate process 
shown system contains agents visitor agent mobile agent brings service requested user user device 
agent able generate xul specification guis needs interact user 
xul specification sent user agent user device 
user agent highly specialised personalization agent responsible storing information user computer user possible 
example knows look feel preferences user gui preferred user imposed user device operating system 
main goals agent proxy generation user interfaces help user services visitor agent modify gui specification visitor agent user preferences create adus agent initialised static gui features monitor user interactions receiving information adus agent 
adus agent main features agent adapt user interface user preferences user device capabilities user agent suggestions generate guis different devices xul specification handle gui events communicate visitor agent user agent 
application developers define user interface xul 
specification rendered transparently developers users various platforms 
adus agent visitor agent 
user agent adus user device visitor agent user proxy wireless network 
indirect generation guis describe synchronization agents example 
previous simple currency converter application converts currencies displays result conversion 
application executed mobile agents travels user device requested user 
main steps see 
visitor agent travels user device step approaches mobile agents 
example equivalent call local application client server architecture 

visitor agent requests generation gui step visitor agent sends xul description gui user agent 
show xul specification gui currency converter service 

user agent processes gui specification 
transforms gui description adapt user preferences creates corresponding adus agent initialised transformed xul description gui generate static information gui device capabilities screen resolution representation language user device wml html java swing information 

adus agent generates gui creates gui information provided user agent static gui information specific information service 
adus agent able map xul description guis devices different title converter value currency converter convert 
currency converter xul description java swing rendering wml rendering features wap device laptop java gui 
example converter application executed device java swing capabilities home pc laptop adus agent generate swing gui see 
executed wap mobile phone gui wml shown adus agent extended mappings kind gui languages macromedia flash 

user interaction user interacts gui looking information device screen device peripherals keyboard mouse buttons enter data select different options 

adus agent handles propagates gui events user actions trigger gui events captured adus agent 
information sent visitor agent reacts user actions service executes generating new gui step user agent store analyse information provided user order reuse service executions 
advantages architecture messages send concurrently load balancing performed 
stress relevance user agent monitor user interaction visitor agents 
knowing user reactions data entered services user agent store data locally apply different artificial intelligence techniques extract knowledge user behavior 
previous example time currency converter service executes user device user agent select dollars euros initial target currencies respectively selection user execution service 
user selects configuration user agent learn improve behavior time 
customization guis really useful user 

state art related section approaches allows generate adaptive gui related works knowledge monitoring user behavior 

adaptive user interfaces various approaches adapt user interfaces various devices 
basically approaches grouped main categories web applications classic desktop applications 
category treats web content transformations web content order usable mobile devices second category treats problems universal definition user interfaces reproduced various program implementations middleware various platforms 
providing details mention middleware approaches language grammar eventbased constraint user action notation 
xml efforts interesting provide flexibility easy manipulation 
similar approach adopted user interface definition language transformed concrete gui transformation done transparently user fly
