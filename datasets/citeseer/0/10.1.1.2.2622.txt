wide area network internet provides necessary communications service gateway user gateway operator service provider 
local area network devices major piece osgi local area network devices connected osgi service gateway 
osgi provides service oriented model access home appliances 
deploying new features device translated putting new services osgi 
way complexity home network technologies hidden users 
required services available friendly manner 
osgi framework osgi framework provides execution environment services 
framework includes java runtime environment extended service life cycle management persistent data storage version management service registry 
basic services device access control log service service integrated framework application services need developed basic services 
fig 
shows software architecture osgi service gateway 
life cycle management provided framework allows application developers divide applications small self components called bundles 
bundles software components implemented java downloaded installed activated framework 
activated bundles may register services service registry provide services bundles framework 
service longer needed easily removed framework affecting bundles 
bundles installed updated dynamic scalable fashion 
new bundles installed added features existing bundles modified updated having restart entire system 
service registry find services secure controlled manner 
service gateway operator full control platform decides service bundles allowed 
osgi bundles log fig 
software architecture osgi service gateway osgi bundles software entities deploying applications 
bundle java archive jar file comprises classes resources 
bundle typically contains java class files non executable resources html presentation help files 
bundle contains manifest file describing contents jar file providing information bundle 
manifest file contains special headers describe bundle framework states bundle dependencies external java classes 
furthermore manifest file designates special class bundle activator 
framework class invoke start methods start bundle respectively 
key features osgi wan drivers adsl cable ethernet device access java virtual machine operating system lan drivers ethernet wlan key characteristics osgi include platform independence platform supports java run osgi service framework 
osgi framework application services service provider independence common foundation different service providers deliver wide range services 
service collaboration support osgi framework allows services deployed discovered services 
multiple device access protocol coexistence osgi inter operate existing device access protocols 
security simplicity osgi environment reduces complexity managing services guarantees access services different service providers 
main limitations osgi osgi limitations heavy weight protocol needs considerable amount processing power memory 
address home appliances nat home appliances accessed directly remote terminal 
connection oriented support multimedia service delivery efficiently 
support asynchronous communication 

sip home appliance access sip initially proposed signaling protocol internet telephony domain identified promising ways multimedia communication today data networks 
sip designed independently underlying protocol message sip sent tcp udp 
sip provides flexible way devices wan exchange information peer peer manner 
sip architecture different entities defined sip user agent ua proxy servers redirect servers location servers 
sip ua take client server role initiates request serving client reacts request acting server 
proxies fulfill tasks application layer routers forward sip request response messages 
proxies redirect servers forward messages directly return address sip user agent proxy server 
location servers contain location information registered devices 
typical sip request originates user agent passes number proxies redirect servers terminates remote user agent
