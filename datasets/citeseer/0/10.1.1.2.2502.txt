indicated fig 
exist query nodes neighbors google query graph av graph nodes 
sight qualitative disparity query graphs surprising 
hypothesize difference methodologies employed search engine accounts disparity 
google employs algorithm calculates importance page function web hyperlinks pages 
google uses circular algorithm probability density neighbors query google query graph probability density neighbors query altavista query graph calculate importance page high importance pages high importance point page 
query hub sites links authoritative sites links matching query ranked higher 
part altavista indexes web pages uses inverted index retrieve urls match 
pages match keywords ranked higher 
result google av return urls semantically related queries google results dependent keywords query importance returned urls 
av hand distinguishing closely related queries returns results quite specific 
generalizing results hypothesize search engine takes account popularity importance site page yield rich densely linked query graph 
interest understand google graph contains large clusters 
sifting queries hundreds neighbors find clusters contain queries everyday words distinguishing key words 
example queries song titles thing just 
queries return densely linked urls microsoft netscape yahoo presumably happen contain words query 
assume community search assistant perform badly kinds queries google search engine 
fact works better expect 
community search assistant uses simple heuristic rank related queries orders related queries count urls common 
technique works surprisingly finding queries semantically related 
example half top related queries song title queries song titles 
contrast alphabetically ordered related searches song title 
filtering mechanism works additional urls common typically music 
interestingly av graph contains spurious clusters relations queries appear meaningless 
known webmasters times add invisible text pages containing long lists keywords 
result search engines operate inverted indices retrieve pages frequently 
av query graph contains large clusters pointing page apparently completely unrelated queries invisible component 
listing pages appears ephemeral reconstruction query graph week contain spurious clusters av longer returned url queries cluster 
av mechanisms recognize pages short 
way new spurious clusters appeared replace old ones disappeared 
note explaining disparity graphs differentiate findings hold number queries construct graph increases findings hold 
done tests larger sets results subsets queries shed light stability results 
example percentage isolates certainly dependent number queries construct graph 
working subset find greater percentage isolates 
likewise density links remains greater google subgraphs av subgraphs
