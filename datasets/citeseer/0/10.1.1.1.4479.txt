semantic duplicate detection querying bibster network receives large number results high number duplicates 
due fact centralized distributed local repositories 
furthermore representation metadata heterogeneous possibly contradicting 
enable efficient easily usable system bibster presents query results grouping duplicates

data value level focuses comparisons data values rdf represented typed literals

compare publications basis similarity sets authors 
similarity measures ontology level extend ones graph structure level ontology specific characteristics 
determine similarity publications topics acm topic hierarchy 
apply hierarchical similarity function earlier 
applying background knowledge specific domain define appropriate similarity functions

variety individual similarity functions value obtained aggregated similarity function weighted average individual functions 
bibster scenario weights assigned experiments sample data 
duplicate relation 
duplicates consider pairs resources similarity larger certain threshold dt sim assume duplicate relation transitive define transitive closure dt dt dt transitive closure essentially represents clusters semantically similar resources 
resource merging 
presenting individual resources query result duplicates visualized merged resource 
merged resources comprise union statements individuals identified duplicates 
case conflicting property values apply heuristics merging resources book titles select detailed value abbreviations
