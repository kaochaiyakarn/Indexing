discussion computer access handicapped research issue years 
considerable efforts put making software systems usable people originally designed access graphical user interfaces visually manually impaired users developing databases dedicated information handicapped information wheelchair accessibility public transportation verbal descriptions paintings museums supplement existing data collections lack essential information people special needs 
solutions restricted fairly small classes handicapped users usually quite expensive due small number potential customers 
techniques area interaction extended way permit extent tailoring generic interactive software systems users including handicapped elderly people 
approach theoretically satisfactory may economically viable isolated dedicated solutions
