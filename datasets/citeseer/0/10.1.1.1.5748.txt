interest community identification usually information community identification algorithms provided hyperlinked structure connecting web pages 
modeling web graph performing operations authors able separate web sets related items 
link information provided creation page influenced author view content provided relationship pages 
content outgoing links page represent unique view subject provided creator 
incoming links page represent unique views particular page 
views necessarily identical creator represent separated views object 
distributed uncoordinated nature link creation main reasons success community identification web 
order identify interest communities service similar entities representing user accesses provided 
approach model users interests graph techniques proposed community identification means identifying communities interest

community summarization ranking purposes relationship community objects interest provided summary community 
far characterized relationships user sessions communities 
plus information objects requested session serve starting point summarization communities 
sessions split disjoint sets respect community set members set non members rest 
set members constituted top ranked sessions positive values 
non members set formed sessions occupying lowest positions ranking negative values 
remaining sessions included third set considered rest summarization process 
union set objects requested member sessions set objects requested non member sessions may disjoint 
community positively evaluate objects requested member sessions negatively evaluate objects accessed non member sessions
