task assignment coordination described team consists robots identical capabilities solving homogeneous agent task assignment problem 
robots serves goalie 
robot fixed role 
robots play rules specify fixed positions 
allow robots dynamically switch predefined mutually exclusive roles 

left primary attacker prepares shoot robots position supporting positions 
right robots spread ball goalie clears defense zone 
roles primary attacker approaches ball attempts move offensive supporter moves field primary attacker positions recover ball primary attacker misses shot goal defensive supporter positions field primary attacker recover ball team captures 
shows robots positioning roles 
agents negotiate predefined protocol single robot fills role 
addition coordinate goalie avoid approaching ball goalie clearing defense zone avoid collisions teammates 
dynamic multi robot coordination providing details different roles assigned robots fill roles briefly describe information sharing teammates 
shared information framework robots communicate order coordinate effectively 
coordination methods rely local information feasible domain cases robot observe ball teammates

robots calculate suitability local information world models function calculate bids teammates shared information provided teammate 
important note reported information calculating teammates bids effect agent doing calculation putting shoes agent bid calculated 
robot calculates bids teammates compares 
highest bid role assigned assumes role
