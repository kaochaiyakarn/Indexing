requirement may easily expressed bpql 
definition bpql simplifies definition process making generalised 
defining activities accepting order senior seller seller possible define mentioned workflow participants 
approach adequate real business process modelled computerized 
role seller may defined bpql follows 
order value order 

user position senior seller 
count performer performs status open 

min user position senior seller 

count performer performs status open 

user position seller 
count performer performs status open 

min user position seller 

count performer performs 
status open line defines condition select lines seller lines 
senior seller perform activity person employed position senior seller line minimal load line senior sellers lines 
similarly users seller position 
condition status open specifies tasks currently performed 
function count determines number activity instances currently performed user 
similarly function min determines minimal number tasks assigned senior seller lines seller lines 
association connects user objects performer objects association performs connects performer objects objects note corresponding path expressions 
general query may return users minimal workload additional function necessary takes randomly 
query optimised index user object user represents application user 
corresponding class part application resource data
