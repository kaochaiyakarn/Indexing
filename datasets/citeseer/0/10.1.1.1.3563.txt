background computational linguistics simply put computational linguistics scientific study language computational perspective 
historically primary motivations computational linguistics research provide computational explanation particular linguistic psycholinguistic phenomenon provide working component speech natural language system 
computational linguists incorporated working systems today including speech recognition systems text speech synthesizers automated voice response systems web search engines text editors language instruction materials 
fundamental concept languages includes variety seemingly distinct categories including natural languages computer languages mathematical languages 
general definition language encompasses language set strings finite set characters symbols finite set characters symbols called alphabet 
string set characters finite sequence characters possibly including white space characters alphabet 
definition includes arbitrary strings 
languages interest restricted character strings satisfy certain properties 
properties define syntax language 
recursive definitions set operations performed characters strings define generative model language produces strings satisfy syntactical properties language

automated algorithms take sentence input determine belongs language called parsers 
parsers play major role computational linguistics 
responsible tasks segmentation strings recognition tagging segmented strings 
segmentation strings defined task parsing tokens continuous stream data 
example input sentence girl sees dog segmentation sentence yield tokens girl sees dog 
purposes process determine input string belongs language 
clear explanation tagging process guided higher level knowledge encoded rules grammar 
segmentation example simple instance 
case segmentation simply achieved looking delimiter white space 
general segmentation strings non trivial non deterministic process requires higher level knowledge guide segmentation 
example consider sentence assume parser allows tokens occur sequentially white space delimiters 
case segmentation process requires progressive analysis string order parse tokens 
various approaches parser employ situation 
read input string character character compare resulting substring table tokens accepted grammar

initially parser reads tries match tokens table 
reads tries match th 
reads tries match finding string listed token table 
note method easy understand efficient 
algorithms parsing task elegantly simply 
parser algorithms exploit syntax grammar segment recognize tokens
