balanced traffic distribution helps increase call admission ratio connections improve responsive time traffic 
network load heavy dynamic efficient algorithms finding feasible paths critical 
multipath routing increase probability accepting connection resource contention 
interpretations multipath routing 
interpretation search multiple paths feasible 
pnni uses search multiple paths sequentially 
selected path meet requirement routing process back resumes alternative path 
approach works network dynamics

routing messages sent multiple paths parallel reserve resources way 
message arrive destination best path selected resources reserved paths released 
alternative approach reserve resources primary path 
messages sent secondary paths check resource availability 
reservation primary path fails secondary path picked resource reservation 
interpretation multipath routing select set paths single connection 
exist feasible path sufficient resources algorithm tries find multiple paths combined resources satisfy requirement 
transmitting contiguous data audio video multiple paths arises problem synchronization

primary task routing maximize resource efficiency measured goals 
goal maximize number qos flows admitted network

re routing number situations re routing desired 
routes connections typically selected network resource availability times requests arrive 
long paths assigned resource contention occurs 
new connections established existing connections torn completion network state changes locally globally routes remaining connections optimal
