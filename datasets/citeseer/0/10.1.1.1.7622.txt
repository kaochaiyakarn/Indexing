predictive text input single tap entry method currently standard text entry mobile domain 
problem facing approach word user word matches input sequence 
standard single tap approach selects words corpus occurrence frequencies ignoring linguistic context 
lead selection words unrelated current input 
implementation context aware predictive text framework overrides frequency selection model words related current context 
mobile devices playing increasingly important role day day life require text input sending text message mobile phone 
nature devices constrains interface available text input 
lead development ambiguous keyboards discussed 
keyboards key represent multiple inputs method required select 
keyboards characters typically grouped sets sets bound particular key 
popular mobile phone layout assumed remainder abc bound key def ghi jkl mno tuv 
assume mapping noted sections relevant applicable situation ambiguous keyboard enter text 
currently ambiguous keyboard input methods mobile devices single tap multi tap 
multi tap mode input character cycles press related key 
layout letter entered pressing key twice 
user presses different key delay previous character fixed input 
single tap method key press represent associated characters 
sequences key presses represent word constructed characters order entered 
word associated key sequence produces pint user cycle available set key keyboard 
terms word entering efficiency single tap considerable improvement multi tap efficiency dependant word wanted user single tap database ii order words tied key sequence user 
issues tackled careful choice corpus build single tap database 
assume database contains words required user issue word selection order provides biggest source potential inefficiency user 
predictive text basic model predictive text database key sequences mapped set words 
refer sets words sequence sets 
example previously introduced mapping sequence set include bap bar 
single tap prediction sequence sets sorted corpus word frequencies 
example sequence set member followed tie vie 
key presses input standard single tap model frequent word associated sequence set displayed 
data suggests cases desired word user 
ironically success rate single tap word prediction leads problems 
system regularly correct users tend rely correctness 
word incorrectly predicted experienced users fail notice 
contrast inexperienced user notices wrong word suggested puzzled system got wrong due positing single tap prediction intelligence possesses 
general problem faced single tap approach addressed illustrated example 
key sequence produces sequence set act cat bat 
user entered text yesterday stray dog chased followed key sequence may surprised see act suggested word 
admittedly system functioning correctly certain common sense expecting system pick correct word contextual clues

common sense approach predictive text previous messages interface context cues context cues words word word relator excitations database key presses framework context sensitive predictive text system 
linguistic context humans ability select relevant word set possible choices common sense knowledge identify possible words best fits context 
standard single tap approach text entry notion context

framework depicted 
standard approach database sequence sets central contextsensitive approach 
approach database linked word relator 
word relator determines words related current context 
example word relator informs database cat related dog chased 
support idea certain words related particular context standard single tap database altered support word excitation 
word related current context word relator informs database excited 
excite word database disregard word frequency data push word start sequence set 
cause returned key sequence entered 
context remain constant database gradually return word original position sequence set excitation occurred 
final piece framework extraction words determine linguistic context 
sources text entered interface previous interactions framework messages sent received 
interesting question words bodies text input word relator 
word certainly lead database exciting words particularly relevant current context 
words may prevent context accurately represented words excited database 
context sensitive word selection investigate new approach single tap text input implemented prototype framework 
sections discuss word excitation database recognition linguistic context determining word relationships 
sequence set excitation traditional single tap approach sequence words sequence set fixed 
context sensitive approach order changed word excitation 
word excited database moved sequence set 
suitable excitation period passed word returned frequency dependent position 
prototype implementation word spends fixed amount time possible position original position sequence 
intended capture fact word retains level excitation outside immediate context 
period excitation currently minute 
may appear short words strongly related current context get re excited user enters text 
context cues issue investigate attempting determine linguistic context piece text parts text provide contextual information 
desirable reasons 
word relator queried input word lot 
computational overhead determining words related input word large see section done regularly impact interactivity system 
second words related possible input word excited database system may lose beneficial effects exciting strongly related words swamping database weakly related words 
refer parts text determine context context cues 
talmy notes closed class words structural open class content carrying 
consequently open class words contextual cues may refined iterations system

concerns interaction standard single tap approach text entry context sensitive extension 
standard approach words commonly occur suggested words occur commonly 
context sensitive approach may override frequency ordering word excitation 
context sensitive approach word sequence set contains common word quite probable excited word may hinder text input 
overcoming problem leads trade database finding appropriate number commonly words sequence sets excluded excitation 
exclude context may adequately represented words excited database 
exclude common words may obscured suggestion
