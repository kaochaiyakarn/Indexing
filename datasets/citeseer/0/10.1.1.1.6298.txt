multi context agents mentioned extension include degrees belief 
describe agents framework multi context systems 
interested explicitly modelling context multi context systems give neat modular way defining agents directly executable 
section briefly notions multi context systems argumentation 
multi context approach agent architecture consists components see formal definition units structural entities representing main components architecture 
called contexts 
logics declarative languages set axioms number rules inference 
unit single logic associated 
theories sets formulae written logic associated unit 
bridge rules rules inference relate formulae different units 
way components model bdi agents separate units belief desires intentions logic 
theories unit encode beliefs desires intentions specific agents bridge rules encode relationships beliefs desires intentions 
unit handles communication agents 
gives diagrammatic representation arrangement 
units need say logic unit communication unit uses classical order logic usual axioms rules inference 
belief unit uses order logic special predicate denote beliefs agent 
modal logic interpretation belief belief modality taken satisfy axioms :10.1.1.52.7924
belief predicate capture behaviour modality need add axioms belief unit adapted 
desire intention units order logic special predicates respectively 
usual treatment desire intention modalities satisfy axioms capture adding relevant axioms :10.1.1.52.7924
desire unit 
intention unit 
unit contains generalisation modus ponens rules inference 
completes specification logics unit 
bridge rules shown arcs connecting units 
approach bridge rules enforce relations various components agent architecture 
example bridge rule intention unit desire unit meaning agent intention desires full set bridge rules diagram strong realist bdi agent discussed done note remainder drop simplify notation :10.1.1.52.7924
meaning rules obvious 
require additional explanation 
intended capture idea term context comes scope instance action bridge rule needs quoted 
communication unit obtains information action completed signified term done agent adds set beliefs 
second intended express fact agent intention signified term passed communication unit agents 
noted formalization ignores temporal aspects refer events instance agent believe true prevented desiring true :10.1.1.52.7924

multi context argumentation system argumentation proposed fox colleagues 
systems argumentation works constructing series logical steps arguments propositions interest may seen extension classical logic 
classical logic argument sequence inferences leading true 
system argumentation adopted arguments prove propositions true false suggest propositions true false 
strength suggestion ascertained examining propositions relevant arguments

possibility increasing granularity decision making process situations picks intention random picks intention expected utility 
third investigate degrees belief inform way agent updates model world learns new things 
belief revision updating belief revision updating different approaches allow agent cope changing world allowing alter beliefs response new possibly contradictory information 
difference actions captured ideas recoverability priority incoming information 
updating takes place assumed incoming information take priority 
applies situations agent operating dynamic world latest information correct 
belief revision hand appropriate agent operating world approximate incomplete erroneous representation 
cases agent wants take account available information 
belief revision consists redefining degrees credibility propositions light incoming information 
model adopts recoverability principle previously believed information item belong current cognitive state consistent

summary suggested way refining treatment beliefs bdi models particular built multi context systems suggested 
believe brings significant advantages 
firstly treatment general ideas argumentation approach take general instance simple devise analogous approach possibility measures measures dempster shafer theory 
secondly degrees belief demonstrated gives plausible means carrying belief revision handle inconsistent data harder conventional bdi models 
thirdly introducing degrees belief propositions provides foundation decision theoretic methods bdi models currently topic little attention
