dtc implementation section current dtc design particular algorithms caching retransmission segments 
segment caching packet loss detection dtc uses segment caching achieve local retransmissions 
memory limitations sensor nodes vital performance mechanism find appropriate way nodes select segments cache 
desirable outcome selection algorithm segments cached nodes close receiver possible nodes closer receiver cache segments lower sequence numbers 
achieve node caches tcp segment highest sequence number seen takes extra care cache segments dropped path receiver 
feedback link layer uses positive acknowledgments infer packet drops hop 
design works active passive acknowledgments 
tcp segment forwarded link layer acknowledgment received may lost transit 
segment locked cache indicating overwritten tcp segment higher sequence number 
locked segment removed cache acknowledgment acknowledges cached segment received segment times 
avoid retransmissions dtc needs respond faster packet drops regular tcp 
dtc uses ordinary tcp mechanisms detect packet loss timeouts duplicate acknowledgments
