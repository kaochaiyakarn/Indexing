evolving competing programs tierra competing programs virtual computers implemented decades usually games

famous evolutionary experiments machine code organisms tierra system 
tierra essentially virtual computer small self replicating programs executed virtual processor 
programs stored sequential access memory composed various machine code instructions 
system operates multitasking mode programs 
processor executes current instruction indicated instruction pointer ip increases local program ip read execute instruction execution resumed note branching jumping instructions modify ip directly allowing execution flow jump sequences instruction possibly program code 
operation cpu switches program queue 
branching operations call ret operate classical assembly language counterparts jmp instruction works specific manner jmp instruction followed series nop nop operation instructions pattern matched jumping process

feature tierra avoids numeric arguments altogether numeric register equivalent cx register holds results arithmetic operations operated bit flipping shifting 
numeric value needed instructions create integer register 
bit genome codes instruction total alphabet system limited instruction set 
programs tierra system seeded delineated specific sequences nops 
reproducing loop copying procedure uses 
programs write inside memory zone section memory explicitly allocated specific alloc instruction 
copied code memory zone divide instruction removes writing privileges zone creates new ip newly created program 
order prevent memory overflow destructive mechanism stores programs queue new programs enter bottom queue destroys program top queue time memory occupation high 
genetic change occurs cosmic ray mutation bit memory flipped instruction executions 
mutation occur copying instructions higher rate 
result operations altered low frequency 
results sight impressive 
distinct species appear parasites smaller pieces code reproduce copying code organisms 
smaller enjoy comparative advantage copied quickly 
need hosts replicate eliminate completely population enters lotka volterra cycle 
hosts defeat parasites leads disappearance
