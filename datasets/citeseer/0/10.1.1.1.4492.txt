application external inference agent event storage um internal inference agent event reports um requests um updates event requests 
centralized student modeling cumulate currently cumulate supports levels queries student model 
value query specifies user property appropriate list objects example documents course topics

protocols current version knowledgetree implements lightweight version communication protocols necessary version function classroom 
implementing protocols group intended right attempt wanted set standards similar projects adhere 
main goal explore distributed architecture practical context find protocols necessary making architecture flexible kind information passed servers different kind 
running implementation concerned simplicity efficiency 
establishing standards communication protocols certainly necessary architecture widespread consider current research necessary precondition process 
soon needs problems sufficiently explored standards crafted group stakeholders experience distributed learning architectures understand different sides problem familiar existing protocols standardization efforts 
protocols develop transparent authentication protocol 
portal activity server able recognize individual users report events student model possibly adapt user 
authentication happen transparently need user log multiple servers session 
transparent authentication single sign recognized industrial problem
