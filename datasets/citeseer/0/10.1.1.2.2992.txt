indexing model files linked web page able extract text model file web page note convert models vrml format refer text sources format 
list describes text sources model file 
model filename filename usually name object type 
extension determines filetype 
example wrl filename vrml file dog 
model filename digits filename create second text source replacing digits spaces 
filenames contain sequence numbers example chair wrl useless text keyword matching 
model file contents model file contains labels metadata filenames included files comments 
vrml possible assign label node part model re node file 
example model chair leg defined assigned re times create remaining legs 
identifiers typically describe names parts model 
describe metadata vrml file may contain node store additional information model detailed description author name filenames included files names model files textures userdefined nodes 
model file may contain descriptive comments
