proposed evaluation muc provides number different subtasks evaluating different aspects information extraction system 
example muc included named entity recognition ner resolution template relation task 
ner task articles selected newswire stories new york times news service domain relevant terms 
named entities annotated manually human assessors articles supplied training data testing 
annotations embedded newswire articles pre defined sgml annotation scheme 
example location encoded enamex tags identified location type attribute value pair enamex type location caribbean enamex 
information extraction task muc realized filling slots pre defined template 
initial task identify template elements 
went identifying named entities extract entity attributes 
main objects identified entity location selectively scenario relation 
attributes location object classify type location city province country region water airport unk type location country region location attributes information comments 
muc tasks provide useful starting point defining evaluation pertinent problems encountered identifying named entities body water assigned country 
muc data provide useful starting point start data geocode locations believe evaluation campaign aimed specifically dealing issues surrounding identification disambiguation geographic collaborate geographic experts researchers create useful relevant resource 
consider existing resources information template element task see www itl nist gov related projects muc task html annotated geographic information suitable training test sets believe appealing challenging type text web data enable methods analyzing structure web documents tested compared 
addition possession collection web data indexed text retrieval part spirit project 
aim select web pages offer various forms geographical information lists names contact details 
linked structure web pages may useful method identifying disambiguating geo allow participants gather additional linked pages 
web pages sampled training test sets manually analysed range geographic 
undefined include entities cities rivers mountains islands regions province cities world wide water regions web specific geographic contexts address post zip code phone number email web address 
spirit project analyzing web pages identify different kinds geographic commonly encounter point discuss participants workshop 
muc provide guidelines constitutes valid geographic 
identifying geographic entities task ground entities 
geographic villages towns cities defined spatially point longitude latitude 
geographic relate region body water province specified single point require set points bound 
initially may ignore locations defined single point simplicity ease 
plan range resources methods encoding eventually allow representation pointer existing geographic ontology 
encode training test data geography markup language gml ensure consistency current geographic annotations allow existing mark tools gml 
similar evaluation muc scoring systems identifying disambiguating geographic 
proportion locations successfully test set disambiguated correctly 

summary believe coordinated evaluation campaign specifically designed test effectiveness identifying disambiguating geographic create useful publicly available resources geographic community provide standard framework methods compared common task dataset 
results kinds campaigns domains shown valuable excellent way stimulating research 
believe help bring researchers designing geographic information systems
