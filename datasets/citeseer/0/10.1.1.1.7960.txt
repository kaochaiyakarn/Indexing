propose novel kind network uses people wires communication media carry message packets devices physical places 
course day people move device device location location 
describe movement people harnessed allow communication electronic messages albeit way relatively unreliable unpredictable compared traditional networks 
new kind network infrastructure number advantages low cost scalability 

principal idea pollen network network devices physical spaces people wires 
examples devices objects include printers facsimile machines video conferencing equipment books small objects 
examples physical locations include meeting rooms offices reception desks 
large variety devices locations typically expensive network wires 
nodes connected movement people 
pollen network provides infrastructure supports distribution collection information relying traditional network technology 
pollen possible information shared distributed needed simply everyday actions groups people 
people need aware distribution place details participation process 
information hints tips comments associated physical objects environment easily available colleagues 
accomplished example pdas perform redundant data transfer 
metaphor plants insects 
insect visits flower take advantage free supply nectar inevitably collects pollen body

way user visits device user leave comments device device transfer pieces pollen user pda 
pieces pollen may visible invisible user depending relevance user 
relevance depends person identity current context 
users notified example pollen addressed specifically pertaining current location 
user visits device pieces pollen stored pda selectively passed 
cumulative actions people interacting devices way messages transferred node node network 
currently java nodes pdas communicate small rugged device case electronic devices equipped suitable wireless contact interface
