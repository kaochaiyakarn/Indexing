spoofed altered replayed routing information direct attack routing protocol target routing information exchanged nodes 
spoofing altering replaying routing information adversaries may able create routing loops attract repel network traffic extend shorten source routes generate false error messages partition network increase latency 
selective forwarding multihop networks assumption participating nodes faithfully forward received messages 
selective forwarding attack malicious nodes may refuse forward certain messages simply drop ensuring propagated 
simple form attack malicious node behaves black hole refuses forward packet sees 
attacker runs risk neighboring nodes conclude failed decide seek route 
subtle form attack adversary selectively forwards packets 
adversary interested suppressing modifying packets originating select nodes reliably forward remaining traffic limit suspicion

account topology changes due radio interference node failure nodes periodically update base station appropriate information 
drastic suspicious changes topology indicate node compromise appropriate action taken 
discussed geographic routing relatively secure wormhole sinkhole sybil attacks main remaining problem location information advertised neighboring nodes trusted 
compromised node advertising location line targeted node base station guarantee destination forwarded packets node 
probabilistic selection hop acceptable destinations multipath routing multiple base stations help problem perfect 
node route hole adversary help appearing reasonable node forward packets 
sufficiently restricting structure topology eliminate requirement nodes advertise locations nodes locations known 
example nodes arranged grid square triangular hex shaped cells 
node easily derive neighbors locations nodes addressed location identifier 

selective forwarding protocols completely resistant sybil attack compromised node significant probability including data flow launch selective forwarding attack strategically located near source base station 
multipath routing counter types selective forwarding attacks 
messages routed paths nodes completely disjoint completely protected selective forwarding attacks involving compromised nodes offer probabilistic protection nodes compromised 
completely disjoint paths may difficult create 
braided paths may nodes common links common consecutive nodes common 
multiple braided paths may provide probabilistic protection selective forwarding localized information 
allowing nodes dynamically choose packet hop probabilistically set possible candidates reduce chances adversary gaining complete control data flow 

authenticated broadcast flooding base stations trustworthy adversaries able spoof broadcast flooded messages base station 
requires level asymmetry node network potentially compromised node able spoof messages base station node able verify 
authenticated broadcast useful localized node interactions 
protocols require nodes messages neighbors 
messages authenticated impossible spoof 
proposals authenticated broadcast intended conventional setting digital signatures packet overhead exceed length typical sensor network packet 
protocol efficient authenticated broadcast flooding uses symmetric key cryptography re quires minimal packet overhead 
achieves asymmetry necessary authenticated broadcast flooding delayed key disclosure way key chains constructed publicly computable cryptographically secure hash function 
replay prevented messages authenticated previously disclosed keys ignored 
requires loose time synchronization 
flooding robust means information dissemination hostile environments requires set compromised nodes form vertex cut underlying topology prevent message reaching node network 
flooding include high messaging corresponding energy costs potential losses caused collisions 
spin gossiping algorithms techniques reduce messaging costs collisions achieve robust probabilistic dissemination messages node network
