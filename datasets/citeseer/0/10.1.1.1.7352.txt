semantic web learning personal computer possible organize resources personal needs 
case remote resources possible anymore storage control user 
hypertext remote material linked retrieved needed 
particular problem finding organizing remote material crucial 
shown standards lom dublin core gaining importance 
provide increased information learning material web 
simple structure prohibits modeling complex knowledge 
explains semantic web technologies ontologies improve different aspects management learning resources 
ontologies means specifying concepts relationships particular domain interest 
web ontology languages owl specially designed facilitate sharing knowledge actors distributed environment

usage scenario professor meyer university professor german university domain computer science 
main fields activity data mining knowledge management 
fields studies evolve rapidly aware latest developments domains 
semester break professor meyer prepares lectures seminars give semester lecture computer science designed knowledge discovery lecture advanced students seminar knowledge management seminar peer peer web services 
material previous lectures feels room improvement 
professor meyer expects find lot material accessible web lecture lecture notes ready 
annotated part material educational markup lom dublin core standards domain computer science uses known acm taxonomy browsing existing content professor meyer planned construction courses way needs systematic overview material collected 
generic ontology acm classification may ontology created colleagues 
case professor meyer needs familiarize content meaning concepts relations ontology may created slightly different viewpoint 
important concepts ontology contains pointers relevant resources collected html pages see www org metadata rdf lom binding 
see instance efforts learning technology standard committee 
www acm org class pdf files powerpoint files 
resources may stored professor computer may located remote location 
professor access resources means standard browser 
finding relevant material prof meyer wants find new material 
considers approaches search world wide web distinct decentralized repositories provide structured semantic metadata learning material 
tasks supported ontology 
provides means extending search term combinations semantically related concepts serves interface semi structured repositories 
querying network semantically annotated material 
suppose professor access edutella network 
edutella peer peer framework different peers provide semantically annotated metadata learning material 
allows integration web services gain access material offered libraries similar repositories see example 
order find new relevant material network professor meyer needs define query 
professor meyer searches lectures topics algorithmics knowledge discovery 
defines query return lecture algorithmics knowledge discovery match retrieve values properties dc title dc author 
sends query network receives answer 
access retrieved resources standard browsers viewers 
send specific queries edutella network get information specific lectures authors interest 
finding learning material web 
professor meyer knows web sites relevant task 
quite certain interesting material pointers accessible time browse sites follow hyperlinks 
obvious solution apply crawler follows links starting pages collect resources showing 
individual user starts crawler lead unnecessary overload web traffic 
hand prof meyer interested harvesting pages accessible start urls specific subset 
selects set concepts ontology specifies kind pages wants retrieve 
crawler scores page hyperlink frequency concepts page hyperlink 
concepts meyer type explicitly semantically related concepts ontology add score

way structure ontology provides complex measure relatedness supports focused crawling process similar typical browsing behavior human user 
scenario take edutella prototypical distributed network semantically annotated learning material 
example pool see 
decides send crawler search new material knowledge management peer peer 
selects corresponding concepts concepts relevant domains 
launches crawler homepages european projects swap considers starting points 
retrieved results browsed ontology 
clustering resources professor meyer wishes organize learning resources retrieved 
ideally wants group similar documents structure document collection certain criteria 
may available clustering algorithms want ignore additional background knowledge encoded ontology 
instance expect lecture machine learning lecture data mining grouped cluster may share technical expressions 
ontology bridge gap subsumes terms knowledge discovery 
important able understand clusters 
needs specific visualization techniques allow understand documents grouped 
ontology structure presentation 
ontology evolution professor meyer wants aware ongoing evolution vocabulary field 
ontology reflect changes include upcoming topics 
web discover upcoming topics new terms showing retrieved documents terms existed increase frequency 
decision topic relevant prof meyer included ontology seen large number upcoming terms expect tool support
