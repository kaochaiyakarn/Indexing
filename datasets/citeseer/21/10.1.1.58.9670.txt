improvements basic protocols sections improved methods 
re confusion known longer id exists higher chances exposing association id corresponding mobile user 
mitigate problem propose method called re confusion objective generate new authorized anonymous id replace old authorized anonymous id fig 
outlines protocol re confusion method 
specifically process re confusion works

administration may want function revoke invalidate issued authorized anonymous id way add revocation function protocol family administrator periodically expires changes keys access authorization 
anonymous ids signed revoked keys longer valid authentication 
solution drawback mobile users need periodically update anonymous ids introduces communication overhead keys administrator expire fast 
solution attach expiration time stamp id expiration time stamp unique mobile user unique association expiration time stamp id reveal identity mobile user 
untraceable routing infrastructure frequent communication home computer mobile device factor exposing association mobile device stationary home
