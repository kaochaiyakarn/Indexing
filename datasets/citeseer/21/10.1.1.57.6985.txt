approach hmm models predicting functional sites proposed genescout system contains specially designed hmm models predicting functional sites hmm model calculating coding potentials 
functional sites include invariant consensus nucleotides degenerate features 
invariant nucleotides completely characterize functional site 
example start codon sequence atg start position mrna protein translation start codon bases coding region gene 
atg codon regular amino acid occurring positions known proteins 
means unable detect start codon simply searching atg genomic dna sequence 
reported statistic relations start codon atg nucleotides immediately preceding bases immediately
