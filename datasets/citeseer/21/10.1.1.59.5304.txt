term spamming evaluating textual relevance search engines consider web page query terms occurs 
type location called field 
common text fields page document body title meta tags html header page url 
addition anchor texts associated urls point considered belonging page anchor text field describe content terms text fields determine relevance respect specific query group query terms different weights different fields 
term spamming refers techniques tailor contents text fields order spam pages relevant queries 
target algorithms algorithms search engines rank web pages text fields various forms fundamental tfidf metric information retrieval 
specific text field term common text field query tf frequency term text field 
instance term apple appears times document body total terms tf apple 
inverse document frequency idf term related number documents collection contain instance apple appears documents collection idf apple score 
tfidf score page respect query computed common terms tfidf tf idf tfidf scores mind spammers goals page relevant large number queries receive non zero tfidf score page relevant specific query receive high tfidf score 
goal achieved including large number distinct terms document 
second goal achieved repeating targeted terms 
assume spammers real control idf scores terms 
search engines ignore idf scores altogether 
primary way increasing tfidf scores increasing frequency terms specific text fields page 
techniques term spamming techniques grouped text field spamming occurs 
distinguish body spam 
case spam terms included document body 
spamming technique simplest popular ones old search engines 
title spam 
today search engines usually give higher weight terms appear title document 
sense include spam terms document title 
meta tag spam 
html meta tags appear document header target spamming 
heavy spamming search engines currently give low priority tags ignore completely 
simple example keywords meta tag meta name keywords content buy cheap cameras lens accessories canon anchor text spam 
just document title search engines assign higher weight anchor text terms supposed offer summary pointed document 
spam terms included anchor text html hyperlinks page 
please note spamming technique different previous ones sense spam terms added target page pages point target 
anchor text gets indexed pages spamming impact ranking source target pages 
simple anchor text spam href target html free great deals cheap inexpensive cheap free url spam 
search engines break url page set terms determine relevance page 
exploit spammers create long urls include sequences spam terms 
instance encounter spam urls buy canon rebel lens case com buy lens case com 
spammers go extent setting dns server resolves host name domain 
spamming techniques combined 
instance anchor text url spam encountered link spam discussed section 
way grouping term spamming techniques type terms added text fields 
correspondingly repetition specific terms 
way spammers achieve increased relevance document respect small number query terms 
dumping large number unrelated terms entire dictionaries 
way spammers certain page relevant different queries 
dumping effective queries include relatively rare obscure terms queries probable couple pages relevant spam page low relevance importance appear top results 
weaving spam terms copied contents 
spammers duplicate text corpora news articles available web insert spam terms random positions 
technique effective topic original real text rare small number relevant pages exist 
weaving dilution conceal repeated spam terms text search engine algorithms filters plain repetition misled 
short example spam weaving remember say right plane tickets thing right place far cheap travel difficult leave hotel rooms wrong thing vacation tempting moment

note spammer point inaccessible pages 

accessible pages maintained presumably affiliated spammer modified limited way spammer 
example spammer may able post comment blog entry comment may contain link spam site 
accessible pages usually straightforward say spammer limited budget accessible pages

simplicity say single target page certain maintenance cost domain registration web hosting associated spammer pages assume spammer limited budget pages including target page 
model mind discuss wellknown algorithms compute importance scores link information 
hits 
original hits algorithm introduced rank pages specific topic 
common algorithm pages web assigns global hub authority scores page 
circular definition hits important hub pages point important authority pages important authority pages pointed hubs 
search engine uses hits algorithm rank pages returns query result blending pages highest hub authority scores 
hub scores easily adding outgoing links large number known reputable pages www cnn com www mit edu 
spammer add outgoing links target page increase hub score 
obtaining high authority score complicated implies having incoming links presumably important hubs 
spammer boost hub scores pages adding outgoing links pages point target 
links important accessible hubs increase target authority score 
rule better limitations budget spammer accessible pages point target 
non target pages point known important authorities possible 
pagerank 
pagerank described uses incoming link information assign global importance scores pages web 
assumes number incoming links page related page popularity average web users people point pages find important 
intuition algorithm web page important important web pages point 
correspondingly pagerank mutual reinforcement pages importance certain page influences influenced importance pages 
analysis algorithm showed total pagerank score pr group pages inaccessible accessible optimal link structure pagerank 
extreme single page depends factors pr prin score component due static score distribution random jump prin score received incoming links external pages score leaving outgoing links external pages score loss due pages group outgoing links 
spam farm model previous formula leads class optimal link structures proved maximize score target page 
optimal structure arguably desirable properties pages reachable accessible ones crawled search engine minimal number links 
observe structure maximizes total page rank score spam farm page particular 
available pages part spam farm maximizing static score 

accessible pages point spam farm maximizing incoming score prin 

links pointing outside spam farm suppressed making equal zero

note wise add links target pages outside farm decrease total pagerank spam farm 
see better rule applies pagerank 
true setting sophisticated link structures spam farm improve ranking target page

section offers overview common spam hiding techniques summarized 
content hiding spam terms links page invisible browser renders page 
common technique appropriate color schemes terms body html document visible displayed color background 
color schemes defined html document attached cascading style sheet css 
show simple html example body background white font color white hidden text font 
body similar fashion spam links hidden avoiding anchor text 
spammers create tiny pixel anchor images transparent background colored href target html img src gif spammer scripts hide visual elements page instance setting visible html style attribute false 
cloaking spammers clearly identify web crawler clients adopt strategy called cloaking url spam web servers return specific html document regular web browser return different document web crawler 
way spammers ultimately intended content web users traces spam page time send document search engine indexing 
identification web crawlers done ways 
hand spammers maintain list ip addresses search engines identify web crawlers matching ips 
hand web server identify application requesting document user agent field request message 
instance simple request message user agent name microsoft internet explorer browser get db pages members html host www db stanford edu user agent mozilla compatible windows nt user agent names strictly standardized really requesting application include corresponding message field 
search engine crawlers identify name distinct ones traditional web browser applications 
done order allow webmasters block access contents control network traffic parameters perform intended legitimate optimizations 
instance sites serve search engines versions pages free navigational links advertisements visual elements related presentation content 
kind activity welcome search engines helps indexing useful information 
redirection way hiding spam content page automatically redirecting browser url soon page loaded 
way page gets indexed search engine user see pages redirection act intermediates proxies doorways ultimate targets spammers try serve user reaching sites search engines 
redirection achieved number ways
