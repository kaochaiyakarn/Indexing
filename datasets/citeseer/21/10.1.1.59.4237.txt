humans prosodic boundaries delimit speech units speaking listening 
structuring reflects speakers internal organisation information facilitates listeners processing message 
previous shown acoustic signalling prosodic boundaries complex number acoustic correlates prosodic boundaries including speaking rate intonation intensity voice quality phenomena proposed 
boundary tones silent pauses generally held important ones duration silent pause positively correlated rank boundary fant 
awareness silent pauses important signalling prosodic boundaries techniques chunking speech stream manageable units speech technology applications 
utterance detectors state art automatic speech recognition typically rely exclusively silence threshold ms delimiting units recognised cf 
ferrer shriberg stolcke mentioned 
say output recogniser comes chunks corresponding speech bounded long silent pauses 
noted spontaneous speech frequently contains silent pauses segments intuitively call utterance units segments semantically coherent units 
human listeners discriminate utterance internal pauses utterance final ones prosodic gestural cues pauses silence thresholds utterance detectors 
silences occur semantically heavy words unit preceding pause may difficult interpret examples 
attempt resolve problems implemented way segmenting speech pause bounded utterance units substantially reduces number unfinished utterance units example units hesitation pauses 
augmented utterance detection involving standard silence detection combination boundary tones 
specifically refer mid level boundary tones single utterance internal pauses utterance final ones 
boundary tones observed act turn keeping turn holding cues fairly different languages
