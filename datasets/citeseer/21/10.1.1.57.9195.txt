advantage adaptive support annotation quite clear system monitors annotations inserted user learns reproduce 
equivalent cases encountered annotations automatically inserted system users just check 
approach called active learning proven reduce burden manual annotation cases 
current methodology interaction annotation tool system quite simplistic 
influences way user annotation system interacts 
generally batch interaction mode adopted user annotates batch texts tool trained batch 
annotation started batch texts system proposes annotations users cases similar training batches recognized 
adaptive constitutes quite improvement respect completely manual annotation approach opinion tremendous potentialities adaptive technologies fully exploited 
believe time consider way interaction organized order maximize effectiveness annotation process minimize burden annotating correcting user side 
expect change influence user annotation tool interaction style moving simplistic user system interaction real user system collaboration propose user centred criteria measure appropriateness collaboration timeliness intrusiveness process 
shows ability react user annotation timely system learn user annotations 
represents level system user example requires cpu stops user annotation activity suggests wrong annotations 
timeliness system ies trained blocks texts time gap moment collaboration means working common goal partners contributing capabilities skills 
annotations inserted user moment system learning 
user system strict sequence 
sequential scheduling hampers true collaboration 
batch texts contains similar documents users may spend lot time annotating similar documents receiving feedback ies simple reason learning scheduled moment 
ies supportive user efficient similar cases little learner offer variety phenomena empower learning 
bigger size batch texts worse problem lack timeliness true collaboration implies re training system annotated text released user 
training take considerable amount cpu time annotation session 
positive collaboration requires constraint user time ies training time intrusiveness ies increases 
believe intelligent scheduling needed keep timeliness learning increasing intrusiveness 
important bear mind timeliness matter perception user side absolute feature important users perceive delay impediment 
focus effective collaboration timeliness cost 
intrusiveness experiments active learning done far turned difficult avoid bothering users proposed annotations generated unreliable rules induced insufficient number cases 
problem mainly related tuning ies behaviour 
ies provide internal tuning methods balancing features precision recall minimum number cases covered order accepted rule annotation 
tuning methodologies designed experts require deep knowledge underline system 
especially true user goal tuning level intrusiveness annotation process obvious correspondent ies tuning methodology 
example amilcare allows modify error thresholds rules number cases covered rules acceptance balance precision recall rule tuning correspond directly tuning level intrusiveness large part relies precision recall balance 
acceptable level intrusiveness subjective users receive suggestions largely regardless correctness want bothered suggestions absolutely reliable 
think user friendly interaction methodology implemented help selecting appropriate level intrusiveness requiring users cope complexity tuning adaptive system 
annotation methodology semantic web takes account problems timeliness intrusiveness mentioned

hand ies training requires cpu time slow user activity 
may happen phases mentioned training active annotation revision discussed section 

active annotation revision phase limiting user idle time training requires time reason current systems batch mode training limit time user wait system trains specific moments coffee time 
explained batch approach presents timeliness problems users may annotate number similar texts learner activated ies able suggest annotations 
appropriate scheduling learning phase improve timeliness user annotation system learning limits user idle time minimum 
observe time spent annotation process select document manually annotate document save annotation notice user time spent manual annotation process 
reason believe right moment train ies background user noticing 
principle possible treat annotation event interface request train specific example requires ability retreat annotations case user errors interaction ies quite complex 
method ies works background parallel asynchronous processes 
hand user annotates document system learns annotations inserted document learner document user 
time separate process ies applies rules induced previous learning sessions document document order extract information suggesting annotations active annotation order silently test accuracy learning 
means annotation capability steps 
advantage idle time user annotation document generally requires great deal time training single text 
coping timeliness explained timeliness fully obtained interaction methodology ies annotation capability refers rules learned entire annotated corpus document 
means ies able help similar documents annotated sequence 
user point view situation equivalent train batches texts disadvantages batch training mentioned batch size quite small 
respect collaboration system user fails effective 
timeliness matter perception user side absolute feature important matter believe users perceive 
respect start consideration applications order documents annotated random 
generally users adopt criteria date creation file name order directories 
cases possible organize annotation order avoid possibility presenting similar documents sequence hide lack timeliness 
order implement feature need measure similarity texts annotation point view 
ies measure 
learning session induced rules applied unannotated corpus 
result main subsets corpus detected texts available rules fire annotations added positive subset texts fire uncovered texts negative subset 
text positive subset associated score number annotations added 
score approximation similarity texts inserted annotations mean similarity respect part corpus annotated far inserted annotation means actual difference 
information timeliness effective completely uncovered document followed fairly covered document 
way difference successive documents probability similar documents turn batch blindness window system low 
incidentally strategy tackles major problem annotation user boredom 
major reason level user productivity effectiveness falls proportional time 
presenting users radically different documents avoid boredom comes coping similar documents sequence
