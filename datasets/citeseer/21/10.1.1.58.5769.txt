joystick offers different types feedback forces friction vibration 
mouse motor create pulses perceived individual events stream pulses audible vibration depending rate 

basic mapping 
mapping control joystick mouse mapping similar string instrument large gestures performed right hand left hand restricted selection gestures 
joystick axis mapped time position hanning windowed segment current sample analyzed fft 
analysis segment generate base timbre inverse fft 
provides control palette timbres 
intended timbre main means expression sense map axis natural dimension joystick arm control 
axis mapped giving sound feeling distance relative amount axis pushed forward 
twist controls stereo position sound source 
velocity mouse axis mapped amplitude bringing motion cymatic 
velocity control provides engaging experience compared position control 
mouse axis directly mapped transposition phase controlling pitch 
personally physical activity playing traditional instruments intended mouse inspire large gestures 
feedback constant force applied joystick axis give musician feedback far axis joystick pushed 
forces push joystick origin lower left corner 
fixed frequency vibration generated mouse joystick relative mouse axis velocity 
system pulses mark passing octaves transposition pulse representing top lowest octave pulses representing bottom highest octave 
mouse goes octave range constant high frequency vibration triggered brought back range 

evaluation playing various musicians series free form sessions called nime 
played solo set gideon nime course tonic experimental music club new york city 
impression playing feels lively 
vibration triggered mouse felt hands reminded trumpet lips forces joystick feel controlling physical 
noticeable weakness mapping pitch relative axis mouse axis 
mouse axes absolute positions relatively easy get lost controlling pitch dramatic changes timbre large quick gestures 
notable difference level pitch control 
instrument designed timbre central means expression pitch mapping limited control 
axis mouse controlling amplitude suffer problems pitch control velocity relative position 
haptic feedback key playing instrument aids greatly dealing 
especially evident haptic feedback stopped functioning due software troubles 
making changes haptic feedback enhance experience 
fixed frequency vibration relative aspects synthesized sound provide information mouse vibration frequency relative pitch joystick vibration relative average amplitude current window sample generate timbre 
forces joystick helpful provide level detailed information precise control timbre 
mouse holds strong associations mouse hand easily fell old habit small discrete gestures normal traditional broad gestures intended 

step understanding haptic feedback provides broadly useful information formal user testing 
plan testing instrument experienced musicians novices see respond 
changes mapping provide expressive intuitive interface 
basic level haptic feedback proven useful instrument enhancing directly aid pitch control 
force effects spring inertia provide useful information joystick axes 
long run game controllers lack level precision needed musical instrument better hardware need developed 
specifically joystick greater range motion precise control mouse feel mouse break standard mouse associations feedback motors faster response times allow quicker gestures
