guiding principle design encourage contribution foster cooperation devices owned different users environment 
people joining environment expected agree share devices contribute networked community reside 
addition serving owners user devices share data knowledge data users devices 
devices contribute success information accesses benefit acquiring useful routing knowledge process enhance ability serve subsequent queries 
routing refers query traveling node node finding answer ensuing process locating desired data

suggest ontology metadata explicitly formally describe data semantics effective approach dealing data diversity ubiquitous environment 
incentive routing protocol propose routing protocol provides incentives devices contribute information accesses 
contribution knowledge gained 
devices interact collaborative manner generates mutual benefits 
cooperative caching user devices maintain local cached copies downloaded data share 
popular data widely cached unused data fade away eventually

system overview ubiquitous computing environment types devices shared devices providing public access private user devices owned particular users 
shared devices sensors server systems generate store data accessed different users environment 
traditionally nearby user devices issue queries similar data searches occur independently search result user device shared reused device 
model people joining environment agree share devices contribute infrastructure 
possible devices contribute information accesses devices gain routing knowledge advantage 
devices different users form peer peer community mutual benefits 
devices community share just data knowledge 
ontology metadata explicitly describe data semantics 
metadata widely propagated 
metadata propagation device advertises knowledge certain data 
receiving metadata device incrementally builds routing knowledge 
devices request information independently 
queries forwarded nodes closest matching metadata similarity function 
results corresponding metadata sent device initiated query query path reverse direction 
intermediate nodes query path benefited copy metadata store update routing knowledge accordingly 
initiating device received metadata direct request data source desired data maintains cached copy 
similar queries received intermediate nodes directly forwarded initiating node cached data stored
