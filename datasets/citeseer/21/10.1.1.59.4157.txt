increasingly important part information economy internet 
great benefit allows ordinary people easily publish opinions experiences 
type information highly subjective great value internet users take decisions simply inform 
viewed problem solving exercise goal user find points view particular topic possible 
example having knowledge enable user decision purchase particular item 
value type user opinions initially harnessed retail sites amazon com contributors build extensive portfolios reviews 
blogs offer user advantages proprietary review sites amazon com 
thing independent blogger owns complete control content posts 
contrast proprietary site requires reviewer give ownership right delete censor reviewer 
importantly reviewer limited posting annotations pertain relevant way stock items proprietary site concept relevance determined enforced retailer 
consequently specific context user may refer item may tolerated considered relevant sales objective retailer 
associated problem fact site ama com supports concepts refer stock items allow user define higher level related concepts 
instance reviewer review specific novel raymond chandler post opinion class books termed detective fiction 
contrast emergence blogging sites allows users full control post comments reviews links topic define local categories contain topics 
centralized proprietary review sites amazon com significant advantage 
provide limited number topics list centrally easy find reviews pertain single novel 
conversely blog entries relating novel may distributed multiple servers entry indexed local category selected user 
key observation review sites topic centric organising information schema describing stock inventory blog sites user centric publishing user perspective multiple topics defined categorised local way user see 
key issue produce topic centric view blogosphere blogger readers quickly find related blog entries topic

describing problem success internet www design open set protocols allowed multiple heterogeneous networks easily linked 
protocols enabled unprecedented flow information original specifications www consider important issues allowing users easily inject information network semantics information posted web 
issue addressed blogging software blog users quickly post annotations web amazon view category id title novel reviews user user wonderful book user reminds direct indirect learned novel writer topic 
blogging phenomenon exacerbates problems posed lack semantic protocols internet 
constraint information posted blogs take form series annotations topics shared interest 
bloggers write independently autonomously standard way organising blogosphere posts relate particular topic automatically indexed 
blog software allows users define tags label posts 
semantics tag defined locally user relating globally understood concept 
clearly benefits distributed information sources organised reader blogger view related opinions single topic concept 
example prominence user reviews proprietary review sites amazon com suggests importance providing sales advice potential customer 
case type topic centric service require blogosphere 
objective provide line mapping service locally defined blog entry categories

mapping service enable set distributed content providers bloggers easily shared concepts 
analysis problem suggests ways forward 
involves agreement ex ante semantic framework allows users define concepts unambiguously 
type eager approach promoted semantic web project 
second adopt structured approach local semantic representations negotiated ex post 
example second technique learns relationships local concepts 
argue dimensions define solution adopted problem 
architecture centralized vs distributed 
characteristics blogosphere centralized 
blogs hosted web different types blog software 
question solution requires blog registered centralized service purely distributed solution deployed 
distributed approach may require participating peers implement communication processing interface blog service 
centralized approach invasive creates single point failure 
semantic coordination ontology vs lexicon 
key issue share meanings collection topics 
ontology approaches aim coordinate respect common interpretation formal representation concepts 
lexical approaches focus language giving emphasis explicit representation semantics 
representation autonomous vs standardized 
currently blog users unconstrained categories blog entries 
may organise subjects meaningfully easily perspective local context 
advantage adopting ex ante semantic framework approach related concepts easily indexed 
disadvantage lies getting agreement semantic components convincing bloggers adopt convention 
current approach allows users organise categorise please 
clear disadvantage relationship locally defined categories learned hand encoded 
sustainability high load vs low load 
secondary issue provide means user categorise subject matter correctly relatively low cognitive load 
example simple categorization system free form tags required may quite low 
complex system large taxonomy categories user significantly find matching category elements available 
locality context vs context free 
related issue autonomy locality refers solution caters context blogger group bloggers create categories 
scale solution imposes global semantic perspective disregards fact meaning may local 
scale completely local perspective difficult link easily local communities 
middle ground recognise meaning local fragmented local clusters shared interests agree common lexicon 
dynamics static vs evolutionary 
blogosphere particularly dynamic environment solution robust new categories new bloggers issue concept drift agreed categories may longer accurate describe concepts contained 

solution directions previous section introduced issues underlie design development solution blog interoperability 
ambitious project research initiatives attempt partial solution 
characterized respect principle dimensions methodological perspective technical perspective 
dimension takes account strategy agreement 
second dimension refers process semantic assessment 
start brief survey possible strategies achieving agreement meaning collection tags 

simplest possible way handle shared lexicon centralized repository store official date version common agreement 
tacit assumption users centralized lexicon 
hand scenario quite simple users charge mapping local lexica respect lexicon 
lexicon acts bridge tags users 
hand clear meaningful agreement lexicon achieved 
furthermore kind approach tends neglect sociological sustainability issues see 
project semantic knowledge organisation systems example type approach semantic web project 
provides basic framework building concept schemes 
core supports rdf description language oriented knowledge organisation systems kos thesauri glossaries controlled vocabularies taxonomies classification schemes 
open directory project representative initiative aims build comprehensive taxonomy centralized web directory 
emphasis explicit formal definition semantics 
meaning category defined implicitly collaborative classification web contents 
com similar initiative specifically tailored blogosphere 
centralized site create channel represented label example user created channel weblog research 
possible notify com blog post related channel method called small message sent channel page 
way com show page specific channel blog posts sent page 
system central control free create channel likes 
solutions arranged strategy suffer drawback vulnerability single point failure 
worthwhile note comprehensive solutions centralized lexicon usually fail satisfy domain specific requirements 
ii 
strategy known peer peer idea pairwise mapping lexica 
notion official lexicon replaced independent pairwise negotiation autonomously defined lexica 
necessary mappings negotiated pair peers 
meaningful coverage community implies quadratic factor growth 
course negotiation agreement heterogeneous lexica knowledge intensive time consuming task 
purpose new solutions conceived automate process 
research effort twofold reasoning mapping linguistic level learning mapping document analysis 
case mapping hypothesis formulated looking linguistic knowledge encoded labels second case interpretation labels supported process learning examples 
principle sustainable previous strategy strategy computationally expensive 
iii 
strategy concerned fully distributed strategy 
basic intuition look problem shared lexicon language game 
agreement common denotation system conceived result trial error interactions 
meaning collection labels emerges process coordination distributed community peers 
language game designed iterative pairwise session 
session defined players speaker hearer 
speaker sends hearer label example representative semantics label 
hearer looks lexicon assess local semantic label 
strategy notion centralized lexicon 
distributed lexicon emerges peer learns topics match interests 
main advantages strategy mappings occur run time process evolutionary cope natural phenomenon blogosphere emergence new labels express new concepts 
methodological perspective technological perspective addresses main approaches syntactic keyword semantic linguistic inductive example 
syntactic keyword 
baseline technique assess relationship tags represented keyword matching syntactic equivalence 
technique easy deliver useful services aggregate place blog posts published authors blog tagged label 
example subscribing feed posts tagged blogging interesting wants monitor comments blogging phenomena done technorati produce results consideration category entire content blog posts huge problem 
possible automatically monitor posts speaks concepts similar blogging different tag 
ii semantic linguistic 
course syntactic approach effective practice 
proliferation different variations tag blog blogging weblog 
prevents recognition synonymous labels 
simple linguistic heuristics stemming help reduce noise 
synonyms detected help linguistic resources wordnet 
wordnet english nouns verbs adjectives adverbs organized synonym sets representing underlying lexical concept 
synonyms reasonably managed phenomenon polysemy harder 
polysemy occurs label refer different meanings necessarily related 
recognition correct interpretation ambiguous labels harder available context sentence 
linguistic resources wordnet tend poor coverage domain specific labels 
iii inductive example 
research semantic web concerned explicit representation meanings 
effort producing formal languages encode concepts usually formal representation self explanatory 
main drawback adoption defined ontology requires preliminary training significant maintenance costs 
alternative approach bottom strategy implicit encoding meaning 
example right interpretation tag derived collection representative posts 
statistical machine learning provides powerful techniques induce correct classifi www technorati com www com cation piece text set examples 
course inductive process prone error automated text classifier margin approximation learning examples sustainable process promoting standards 
example successful online service blog category labels technorati 
technically technorati simply aggregator fetches blog entries user defined categories associated offers web pages containing posts tagged category label service provided useful allows monitor chosen keyword 
requires user know precisely looking case 
service support synonyms example posts tagged blog blogging blogs shown different pages 
support polysemy 
example posts tagged python page notwithstanding fact may refer animal programming language 
researcher studying bothered non relevant posts programming language 

project objective project provide line matching service blog entries categories 
goal allow user find posts categorized users labels semantically equivalent chosen 
wish overcome limitations previous approaches retaining advantages working tags category labels 
approach semantics users categories automatically learnt system 
learning takes place language games technique 
usage patterns user call local context taken account 
allows example handle situations bloggers category label totally different meanings 
functional point view tackles situation initial case see 
discuss details design implementation choices 
regard architecture proposing centralized solution service available web site stores repository blogs matching engine mapping layer presentation layer see 
blogs repository stores copy users blogs 
matching engine implements language games technique match semantics categories defined different users basis sample posts stored repository 
mapping layer provides relationships users categories leveraging matchings matching engine 
presentation layer simply allows users perform queries visualize responses 
motivations choosing centralized approach distributed types 
social aspect 
distributed approach require users install run distributed version top blogs 
cases blogs stored hosting sites allow users install run customized example visit posts tagged category blog technorati com tag blog presentation layer mapping layer matching engine blogs db topic centric vs user centric views 
features
