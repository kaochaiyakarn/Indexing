web personalization prototype system integrates usage data content semantics expressed taxonomy terms order produce broader semantically focused set recommendations 

web personalization process customizing web site needs specific user set users 
research efforts web personalization correspond evolution extensive research web usage mining 
personalization system relies solely usage results valuable information conceptually related recommended may missed 
tackle problem propose web personalization framework semantic enhancement web usage logs related web content 
web personalization prototype system framework proposed 
system integrates usage data content semantics expressed taxonomy terms order produce semantically enhanced navigational patterns subsequently producing valuable recommendations 

framework innovation prototype system exploitation web content semantics web mining personalization process 
utilizes web content structure mining methods assign semantics web pages subsequently feeds knowledge web usage mining algorithms 
web content semantically annotated terms predefined domain specific taxonomy categories thesaurus 
annotations encapsulated logs virtual extension web usage logs 
logs input web usage mining process resulting set rules patterns consisting thematic categories addition uris 
furthermore semantically annotated web pages organized coherent clusters system taxonomy 
clusters order expand set recommendations provided user 
process results broader semantically focused set recommendations

main functionalities demonstrated system described 
detailed description 
logs preprocessing system provides full functionality preprocessing kind web logs enabling definition new log file templates filters including excluding records field characteristics new logs stored new clean log files 
user computer publishing mechanism processed web logs web site content taxon thesaurus fig 

system architecture suggested uris categories user clickstream recom engine document clusters document clustering logs usage patterns web usage mining logs creation data preprocessing processed web logs content retrieval system crawls web downloads web site pages extracting plain text variety crawled file formats html doc php ppt pdf flash stores appropriate database tables 
keyword extraction translation user selects different methods extracting keywords 
prior final keywords selection non english keywords translated automated process system currently supports greek content 
extracted keywords stored database table relevant frequency 
keyword category mapping extracted keywords mapped categories domain specific taxonomy 
system finds closest category keyword mechanisms provided thesaurus wordnet
