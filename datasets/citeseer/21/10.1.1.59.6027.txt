hand encountering node low delivery predictability certain node higher metric encountered reasonable time 
situations want strict deciding give messages 
furthermore problem deciding nodes give certain message 
distributing message large number nodes course increase probability delivering message destination return system resources wasted 
hand giving message nodes just single node system resources probability delivering message probably lower incurred delay higher

issues outlined 
real scenario network mix truly intermittently connected nodes encounter nodes occasionally clusters currently connected nodes 
possible areas connectivity satellite gsm link bandwidth link highly limited expensive feasible bulk data transfer 
interest carriers send requests bulk data transfers delivered intermittently connected network approximately halving delivery time data 
protocol extended handle situations performing equally case truly opportunistic network 
extensions increase complexity protocol important studies conducted gain understanding basic protocol moving complex systems 
evaluation fifo queue nodes new message arrives full queue message queue longest time dropped 
better strategy example dropping message forwarded largest number nodes 
reduce required buffer space improve performance interesting evaluate impact allowing nodes request ack message 
allow messages delivered purged network leaving resources messages increasing probability messages delivered 
simple forwarding strategy prophet evaluation worked fairly outperformed epidemic routing 
interesting investigate forwarding strategies see performance enhanced 
example beneficial investigate idea give messages nodes higher delivery predictability nodes strategy 
similarly number nodes message forwarded limited reducing resource usage vital find optimal number forwards avoid performance degradations
