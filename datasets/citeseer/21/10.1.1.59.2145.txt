summarization approaches 
maximal marginal relevance mmr mmr vector space model text retrieval suited query multi document summarization 
mmr sentences chosen weighted combination relevance query generic summaries general relevance redundancy sentences extracted 
relevance redundancy measured cosine similarity 
relevance normally cosine similarity sentence query vectors task consisted generic query dependent summaries relevance determined cosine similarity sentence vector document vector representing average sentence vectors complete meeting 
mmr score sentence document average document vector average vector set sentences selected trades relevance redundancy 
larity documents 
cosine simi implementation mmr weight annealed relevance emphasized summary short summary grows longer emphasis increasingly put minimizing redundancy 
third summary second third final third summary experimentation needed determine optimal annealing schedule 

latent semantic analysis lsa lsa vector space approach involves projection term document matrix reduced dimension representation 
originally applied text retrieval applied variety areas including text summarization 
lsa singular value decomposition svd term document matrix elements represent weighted term frequency term docu ment svd term document matrix decomposed follows diagonal matrix singular values matrix left singular vectors matrix right singular vectors 
rows may regarded defining topics columns representing sentences document 
gong liu summarization proceeds choosing row sentence highest value 
process continues desired summary length reached 
je offered strong criticisms gong liu approach 
firstly method described ties dimensionality reduction desired summary length 
secondly sentence may score highly win dimension extracted despite candidate 
je proposed solution extracting single lsa sentence score variable dimensionality reduction 
address concerns gong liu approach extracting best sentence topic best sentences extracted determined corresponding singular values matrix number sentences summary come topic determined percentage largest singular value represents sum singular values topic 
dimensionality reduction longer tied summary length sentence topic chosen 
method level dimensionality reduction essentially learned data 

feature approaches feature approaches proven successful text broadcast news summarization 
augmented textual features set prosodic features gaussian mixture models extracted non extracted classes 
prosodic features mean standard deviation energy duration estimated normalized word level averaged utterance 
lexical features tfidf average maximum tfidf score utterance 
word document tfidf score equal total number doc number documents containing number occurrences uments second feature approach created single sentence scores addition features order determine score beneficial determining sentence importance 
reduced original term document matrix dimensions je reducing single dimension yielded best results corpus personal communication 
lsa sentence score obtained th element th sentence vector corresponding singular value 

experimental setup human summaries icsi meeting corpus evaluation training feature approaches 
evaluation set meetings defined multiple human summaries created meetings test meeting having manual summaries 
remaining meetings regarded training data single hu man summary created 
standardized method creating summaries look depends uses put

annotators access graphical user interface gui browsing individual meeting included earlier human annotations orthographic transcription audio topic segmentation shallow hierarchical decomposition keyword text labels describing topic segment 
summarization annotators created topic segmentation earlier task seen meetings 
annotators told construct textual summary meeting aimed interested research carried researcher similar headings general meeting talk decisions group progress achievements problems described annotators word limit heading told text general headings may null annotations meetings 
annotators new data encouraged listen meeting straight author summary 
immediately authoring textual summary annotators asked create extractive summary different gui 
gui showed textual summary orthographic transcription topic segmentation line dialogue act pre existing coding dialogue act categories displayed just segmentation 
annotators told extract dialogue acts convey information textual summary support correctness summary 
specific instructions number percentage acts extract redundant dialogue act 
dialogue act extracted required second pass choose sentences textual summary supported dialogue act creating mapping recording textual summary 
expectation extracted dialogue act summary sentence linked opposing resource told annotators circumstances dialogue acts summary sentences stand

sample summarization output examples part human summary corresponding part automatic summary lsa respectively 
roughly information automatic summary relatively choppy clear

corresponding snippet lsa summary say system supposed break remaining tasks going solve human 
time pretending human pretending 
corresponding snippet lsa asr summary reverse system supposed break remaining tasks going solve human 
seen examples asr errors affect readability summaries items extracted place lsa lsa asr approaches different term document matrices 
lsa asr summary contain second utterance 
ultimately want evaluations meeting summaries useful human subjects determine context meeting browser application 
reliance measures critical completely robust summarization evaluation 

lsa method consistently performed best significant improvement mmr share advantages mmr 
example mmr ideal query multi document summarization eventually want users able create query summaries meetings unable attend 
feature approaches perform worse unfortunately case finding right features trivial task current preliminary relies small prosodic database 
adding pause rate speech information example prove useful 
surprisingly extracting single lsa score je prove helpful 
experimentation level dimensionality reduction may replicate je success 
critical task lower dimensionality greatly biasing major topics 
dimensions case high 

focus immediate put greatly expanding prosodic database building various types classifiers feature approach 
additional emphasis put structural features complement prosodic lexical features 
second avenue research involves finding method automatic utterance detection relying mapping dialogue act annotation asr transcripts 
investigating disfluency removal question answer linking may improve extracted summaries 
furthermore extrinsic evaluation utilized order get clearer picture useful summaries context multimedia meeting browser
