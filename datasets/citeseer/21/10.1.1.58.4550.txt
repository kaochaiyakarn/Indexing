current implementation game displays different taboo words 
players allowed type image taboo words type plurals phrases containing taboo words 
rationale taboo words initial labels agreed image general ones man picture ruling players enter guesses specific 
additionally taboo words guarantee image get different labels associated 
labels label threshold words labels images ones players agree 
additional information utilized guesses players enter purposes information ignored 
words players agree ensure quality labels agreement pair independent players implies label probably meaningful 
fact labels come different people potential robust descriptive labels individual indexer assigned

repeated passing notifies system image longer game point time 
repeated passing indicate image complex game case image removed 
fully labeled images re inserted game months passed meaning images may changed due maturation effects

example image michael jackson years ago labeled today labeled criminal implementation details current version game implemented java applet played www org 
applet connects centralized game server responsible pairing players providing pair set different images corresponding taboo words comparing players guesses currently guesses characters long storing information 
game server starts game seconds new player logs waits second boundary pair player start game 
done sure players get paired random cheat logging time friends 
current implementation complete images available playing images web 
currently label threshold 
pre recorded game play implementation require people playing time single person play pre recorded set actions partner set actions recorded earlier game session involving people 
image session guess partner recorded timing information 
refer set pre recorded actions bot having pre recorded game play especially useful game gaining popularity 
players single person usually playing game time 
notice pre recorded game play necessarily labeling process 
single player bot agree label agreed actions recorded increase confidence regarding label 
single player bot match word get brand new label 
cheating imperative partners able communicate agreeing image trivial 
similarly players cheat agreeing unified strategy instance large group players agree type image achieved posting strategy popular website 
current implementation mechanisms place counter cheating 
notice form cheating game meant played hundreds thousands people distributed locations 
players randomly paired information partner way previously agree strategy 
probability cheaters strategy paired low 
said additional steps taken minimize cheating 
ip addresses players recorded different partner players paired 
second counter global agreement strategy type image pre recorded game play 
massive agreement strategy detected inserting large number bots acting pre recorded sets actions cheating impossible 
people realize massive agreement strategy doesn lessen prerecorded game play 
massive global agreement strategy easily detected measuring average time players agreeing images sharp decrease average time indicate massive agreement strategy 
alternative mechanism prevent agreement strategy enforce taboo words entire session 
pair answer image taboo word duration session 
coupled label threshold greater prevent global agreement strategy corrupting labels

previous techniques processing images point method labeling images web evidence produce high quality labels 
variety techniques processing images web different nature 
survey different techniques contrast method 
computer vision considerable computer vision related automatically labeling images 
successful approaches learn large databases annotated images 
annotations typically refer contents image fairly specific comprehensive 
methods cluster image representations annotations produce joint distribution linking images words 
methods predict words image computing words high posterior probability image 
methods attempt combine large semantic text models annotated image structures 
impressive algorithms learning don general settings marginally restricted settings

different line research attempts find specific objects images 
instance introduced method locate human faces photographs 
algorithms typically accurate developed wide range objects 
additionally combining algorithms detecting specific objects single general purpose classifier non trivial task 
esp game provides possible solution problem having computer program label images remains important goal 
application esp game creation program limitations current computer vision techniques partly arise lack large databases annotated images 
databases constructed methods similar game 
image search web finding effective methods search retrieve images web prevalent line research industry 
text image retrieval systems annotate images text derived html documents display 
text include image text surrounding image entire text containing page filename containing html document filename image 
proposals link structure web assign authority values images 
images come authoritative web pages pages higher pagerank displayed images coming authoritative pages

possibility explored involves combining text systems computer vision techniques 
approach allows different types queries processed similarity queries doesn imply significant improvement approaches comes standard text queries 
fundamental limitation current methods image retrieval web heavy text determine contents images 
text adjacent images scarce misleading hard process 
queries return results

inappropriate content filters inappropriate content filters attempt block certain images displayed 
typically filters try block pornographic sites reaching children home employees workplace 
computer vision techniques purpose highly accurate content filters usually analyze text inside web pages determine blocked 
filters reasonably accurate flaws 
languages cases pages english 
second poorly pages don contain text page image correctly identified 
reason order ensure inappropriate content get posted dating services websites allow users post images hire people look single picture posted 
third content filters constantly updated imagine happen new porn star named comes suddenly search return pornography 
google image search offers content filter called attempts block inappropriate images displayed search results 
time writing query returns inappropriate images direct query wet returns inappropriate results 
argue having proper labels associated freely available image web improve content filtering technology 
labels primarily concerned obtaining appropriate labels images labels 
case image search building labels current systems difficult thought html captions text appearing right image 
na strategy signify improvement current techniques captions provide useful data 
intelligent techniques conceived assigning higher weight labels coming esp game opposed regular html captions numerical weight label threshold 
arriving optimal strategy labels outside scope left 
case providing textual descriptions visually impaired labels slightly trivial 
game produces labels explanatory sentences 
keyword labels perfect certain applications image search applications accessibility benefit explanatory sentences 
having meaningful labels associated images accessibility purposes certainly better having 
today screen reading programs visually impaired image filenames html captions attempting describe images web majority images web captions non descriptive filenames 
propose labels collected game available screen readers users determine labels want hear image 
extensive tests required determine optimal strategy 
esp game novel interactive system allows people label images enjoying 
evidence people play game labels produces meaningful 
data suggest people playing game hours day enable label images indexed google matter weeks 
striking large number popular games web players time 
having proper labels associated image web allow accurate image retrieval improve accessibility sites help users block inappropriate images 
main application esp game label images applications areas hci accessibility main contribution stems way attack labeling problem 
developing complicated algorithm shown conceivable large scale problem solved method uses people playing web

course success variations esp game depends people enjoy playing 
mechanism attach labels images languages 
problems solved having people play games include categorizing web pages topics monitoring security cameras
