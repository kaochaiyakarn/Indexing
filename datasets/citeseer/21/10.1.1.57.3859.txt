websom method problem addressed websom method automatically order organize arbitrary free form textual document collections enable easier browsing exploration 
ordering documents encoded crucial step ordering depends chosen encoding scheme 
principle document encoded histogram words computational reasons order words neglected 
computational burden orders magnitude large vast vocabularies automatic full text analysis 
additional problem word histograms words similar meaning contribute histogram differently pair words 
useful full text analysis method synonymous expressions encoded similarly 
different view levels websom browsing interface map zoomed map map node single document order increasing detail 
moving levels neighboring areas level done mouse clicks images document links 
interesting area map may arrow images proceed explore neighboring areas containing related documents 
contrasted traditional information retrieval techniques users know considerable numbers relevant documents just outside search results 
currently feasible incorporate real life experience word meanings text analysis method remaining alternative statistics textual contexts words provide information relatedness 
turned size word histograms reduced fraction called self organizing semantic maps
