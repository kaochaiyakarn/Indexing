trust serv lightweight trust negotiation service benatallah fabio casati university new south wales sydney nsw australia cse unsw edu au web service environments scalable access control methods required requester populations large dynamic 
reason requester identities known advance traditional access control models rely identity determine access fit 
models require requesters submit credentials signed assertions describing attributes owner service invocations

policies specify resources credentials service operations disclosed state trust negotiation conditions disclose 
trust negotiation policies may quite complex largely ad hoc development time consuming error prone

trust serv design overview trust serv trust negotiation policies expressed state machines :10.1.1.2.3612
states represent level trust achieved requester far negotiation 
entering new state requester access resources mapped state 
associating resources directly states abstraction roles 
roles semantic abstractions describe function performed people processes developer tester 
trust serv maps resources roles roles states 
roles cumulative requester may member roles 
transitions extended traditional state machines capture security abstractions necessary trust negotiation labeling authorization abstractions 
authorization abstractions define conditions met transitions fired 
types authorization abstractions explicit implicit 
explicit transitions triggered actions performed requester 
type explicit transition credential disclosure 
type transition requires party disclose credentials may place constraints acceptable values attributes contained credentials 
explicit transitions include provisions obligations 
provisions require actions taken proceeding obligations require actions taken 
represent provisions service operations invoked trust negotiation proceed 
obligations represented service operations require requester digitally sign message stating service operation invoke deadline compensation required obligation met 
implicit transitions triggered provider 
timed transitions implicit fired timeout events occur usually requester perform action period time 
trust negotiation policies specified trust serv take care enforcing behalf users relieving developers need implementing logic service provider code described 
enterprise policies change adhere changing business strategies 
lifecycle management policies important issue considered trust negotiation systems 
trust negotiations may long lived may necessary change policy ongoing trust negotiations policy 
may possible ongoing negotiations finish old policy especially breach laws regulations properly protect business assets 
situations necessary appropriately migrate trust negotiation instances new policy 
trust serv supports migration strategies handle migration trust negotiation instances old policy new policy details may :10.1.1.2.3612
strategies controlled strategy selection policy meta policy specified separately trust negotiation policies 
meta policy collection rules requesters visited state migrated new policy 
trust negotiation policy updated strategy selection policy defined 
ongoing trust negotiations evaluated meta policy outcome evaluation determines strategy apply trust negotiation instance migrate follow appropriate policy

demo scenario scenario developed trust serv platform 
scenario involves online requester alice 
scenario works follows alice invokes operation service buy book 
trust negotiation controller service intercepts request initiates trust negotiation alice trust negotiation controller 
provider deploys new policy trust negotiation alice migrated new policy 
demonstrate define trust negotiation policy service ii perform trust negotiations automatically manually iii migrate ongoing trust negotiations new policies strategies 
defining managing policies trust serv 
defining trust negotiation policy 
firstly demonstrate create trust negotiation policy modeler 
define policy provider service shown 
roles may mapped states roles created 
show achieved trust negotiation modeler 
show credentials mapped roles 
default credentials stored plain xml files need deploy dbms purely purpose supporting trust negotiation 
support dbms may configured desired 
defining transition conditions authorization abstractions achieved separate windows shown lower right hand corner 
definition policy complete show converted control rules control rules deployed provider container 
performing trust negotiations 
provider container ready deploy requester service called alice 
alice web service trust negotiation policy container service attempt invoke operations provider service 
purpose demonstration developed trust negotiation monitors 
monitors alice invokes purchase operation twice policy window left shows alice trust negotiation monitor window right provider monitor 
alice trust negotiation migrated state new provider policy invocation purchase operation disclose credit card second invocation 
may deployed requesters providers show progress negotiation including messages sent controllers requester provider 
addition monitoring trust negotiations monitors permit requester provider negotiate manually invoking trust negotiation operations controllers 
shows requester monitor provider monitor 
alice starts invoking purchase operation provider service 
sends invocation container deploys trust negotiation controller instance handle trust negotiation 
alice invocation intercepted provider container similarly spawns controller instance deal alice 
controller instances send requests responses back forth policies requester service provider service 
provider monitor see requester service alice enters new state 
alice negotiated sufficient trust invocation purchase operation forwarded provider service sends reply 
migrating trust negotiations 
point provider decides change policy shown upper window lower window 
alice requires different credential disclosed invoke purchase operation credential alice disclosed 
provider defines strategy selection policy appropriately migrate existing trust negotiations 
result policy update alice trust negotiation instance migrated state old policy state new policy membership buyer role deactivated 
alice attempts invoke purchase operation 
due migration trust negotiation instance provider longer access operation 
trust negotiation resumes provider requests discloses credit card continue 
disclosing credential alice able invoke purchase operation 
complex scenario deploy multiple requesters show different migration strategy may applied trust negotiation instance
