relationships important order context represent world user help system better understand user activities intentions 
modelling key elements relationships ameliorate difficulties expanding system 
know possible elements relationships earlier design stage know prepare elements relationships added system time development 
approach context model help understanding elements influence users intentions doing activities 
approaches analysing understanding human activity tasks activity theory task analysis 
purpose defining elements context model attempting relate existing partial classification context developed approach activity theory 
main reasons activity theory 
provides simple standard form describing human activity 
acknowledges fellow humans fully understand full moment moment richness humans activities states goals intentions 
manage interact interpret actions enormously higher degree success existing context aware computer system 
attempting produce better context aware systems possible necessary model richness human activity 
progress current state art propose sufficiently comprehensive context classification may developed relatively simple standard form offered activity theory covers key elements influencing human activity 
secondly takes account concepts tool mediation social environment important ubiquitous computing world 
ubiquitous computing users allowed different computing devices physical virtual 
users computing services anytime means services different social environments 
social environments tools important elements influence users intentions doing activities 
activity theory models relationships elements 
useful way model relationship element context model 
activity theory background activity theory developed russian psychologists vygotsky ev 
activity theory philosophical framework conceptualize human activities
