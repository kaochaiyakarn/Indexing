related exception today phishing attacks rely small set tools tricks attack victims attacks legitimate requests information 
send victims obfuscated messages obfuscation may serve bypass spam filters disguise hide true content message human recipient 
example spammers insert random words email words typed text color background order emails unique constitutes form obfuscation common commercial spam filters 
similarly actual hyperlink phishing email commonly apparent hyperlink displayed users email programs 
detection common obfuscation methods help improve spam filters provide visual feedback users turn allow ordinary computer users detect avoid phishing attacks 
techniques detect possible obfuscation attempts useful order users aware phishing attacks 
example tool 
importance tools increase start mounting distributed phishing attacks 
way spam proposed rivest 
propose identity authentication mechanism retains offered emails today 
virtue identity construction proposal rely pki infrastructure advantage terms deployability 
note useful techniques fight distributed nature 
similarly blacklists meaningful absence authentication email currently case 
phishing attacks aim capture personal identifying information pii victim 
information captured having deploy web site poses legitimate service provider victim 
fraudulent sites nearly indistinguishable legitimate ones impersonate 
examples common pins passwords mothers maiden names social security numbers outputs devices deployed reasons authentication token rsa security 
example static clear protected attacker learn 
example dynamically changing pii needs protected short window time attacker order gain access resource associated token 
cases suffices attacker get access resource damage done 
second line defense phishing mutual authentication techniques 
alert user attempt masquerade service provider user doing business allow user abort authentication pii leaked 
importance type defense increase light 
threat described window attack proposed jakobsson myers 
attack victim window appears valid login window secure method ssl mutual authentication method 
window simply send captured password attacker controls site corresponding window 
attack approximates effects keyboard logger having corrupt victim machine 
visual feedback mechanism proposed defeat window attack 
known attack causes leaks side channels side channel rogue site asks users register get service hope user reuse service providers 
password randomizing plugin proposed boneh serve prevent leaks 
related weakness corresponds mechanisms help users forgotten passwords may done sending stored password user allow user reset user authenticated properly site 
authentication done security questions done proving access account associated user 
case reuse security questions remains problem plugin randomization user needs sure plugin acting filter information needs protected 
case relies secure confidential delivery emails reasonable assumption cases 
background phishing obtains login password pairs phishing victims encrypts pairs public key steganography broadcasts resulting files public bulletin board 
done image files posted usenet 
refer reader information modern steganographic techniques 
benefit having malware covertly broadcast asymmetric ciphertexts shown 
fact broadcast means singled reads broadcast obtains broadcast 
public key cryptography needed want able decrypt ciphertexts 
public key steganography needed ensures bulletin board hosts identify presence ciphertexts bulletin board posts 
embedded asymmetric ciphertext identified news servers option rejecting image files contain 
refer reader information modern steganographic techniques 
public key steganography ensures asymmetric ciphertexts indistinguishable noise typically find multimedia file example 
public key steganography instance produce asymmetric ciphertexts polynomially indistinguishable bit strings chosen uniformly random 
foundation public key steganography placed theoretical grounds things utilizes probabilistic bias removal 
straightforward steganographic embedding asymmetric ciphertext image file satisfy definition public key stegosystem embedded data may readily identified asymmetric ciphertext 
example consider elgamal prime modulus public 
multiple embeddings elgamal ciphertexts potentially detected values ciphertext prime modulus
