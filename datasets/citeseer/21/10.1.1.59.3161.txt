parallel dataflow approach sql software terabyte online databases consisting billions records common price online storage decreases 
databases represented manipulated sql relational model 
paragraphs give rudimentary relational model concepts needed understand rest 
relational database consists relations files cobol terminology turn contain tuples records cobol terminology 
tuples relation set attributes fields cobol terminology 
relations created updated queried writing sql statements 
statements syntactic sugar simple set operators chosen relational algebra 
select project called scan simplest common operator produces row column subset relational table 
scan relation predicate attribute list produces relational data stream output 
scan reads tuple applies predicate 
true scan discards attributes inserts resulting tuple scan output stream 
expressed sql scan telephone book relation find phone numbers people named smith written select telephone number output attribute telephone book input relation name smith predicate scan output stream sent relational operator returned application displayed terminal printed report 
lies beauty utility relational model 
uniformity data operators allow arbitrarily composed dataflow graphs 
output scan may sent sort operator reorder tuples attribute sort criteria optionally eliminating duplicates 
sql defines aggregate operators summarize attributes single value example sum min max attribute counting number distinct values attribute 
insert operator adds tuples stream existing relation 
update delete operators alter delete tuples relation matching scan stream 
relational model defines operators combine compare relations 
provides usual set operators union intersection difference exotic ones join division 
discussion focus equi join operator called join 
join operator composes relations attribute produce third relation 
tuple ta join finds tuples tb attribute value equal ta 
matching pair tuples join operator inserts output steam tuple built concatenating pair 
codd classic showed relational data model represent form data operators complete codd 
today sql applications typically combination conventional programs sql statements 
programs interact clients perform data display provide high level direction sql dataflow 
sql data model originally proposed improve programmer productivity offering non procedural database language 
data independence additional benefit programs specify query executed sql programs continue operate logical physical database schema evolves 
parallelism unanticipated benefit relational model 
relational queries really just relational operators applied large collections data offer opportunities parallelism 
queries non procedural language offer considerable latitude executing queries 
relational queries executed dataflow graph 
mentioned graphs pipelined parallelism partitioned parallelism 
operator sends output operators execute parallel giving potential speedup 
benefits pipeline parallelism limited factors relational pipelines rarely long chain length unusual

partitioned version classic entry sequence file 
round robin partitioning excellent applications want access relation sequentially scanning query 
problem round robin partitioning applications frequently want associatively access tuples meaning application wants find tuples having particular attribute value 
sql query looking smith phone book example associative search 
range partitioning round robin hashing basic partitioning schemes

hashing tends randomize data cluster 
range partitioning clusters tuples similar attributes partition 
sequential associative access clustering data 
shows range partitioning lexicographic order clustering algorithm possible 
tree common clustering algorithm 
range partitioning derives name typical sql range queries latitude bubba gamma oracle tandem provide range partitioning problem range partitioning risks data skew data place partition execution skew execution occurs partition 
hashing round robin susceptible skew problems 
range partitioning minimize skew picking non uniformly distributed partitioning criteria 
bubba uses concept considering access frequency heat tuple creating partitions relation goal balance frequency partition accessed temperature actual number tuples disk volume cope 
partitioning simple concept easy implement raises new physical database design issues 
relation partitioning strategy set disk fragments 
increasing degree partitioning usually reduces response time individual query increases throughput system 
sequential scans response time decreases processors disks execute query 
associative scans response time improves fewer tuples stored node size index searched decreases 
point partitioning increases response time query 
point occurs cost starting query node significant fraction actual execution time cope dewi
