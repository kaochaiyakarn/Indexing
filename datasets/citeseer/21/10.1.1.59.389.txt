multimedia streaming reconfiguration framework supports construction execution highly dynamic qos aware distributed multimedia systems 
access resources controlled distributed admission control mechanism 
application model specifies resource requirements components updates specification application reconfigured 
application admission control agent distributes resource requests hosts controlling required resources 
agent enters negotiation various resource managers determine suitable allocation physical resources 
outcome negotiation may influenced priority importance application higher priority applications permitted steal resources low priority companions 
medical context allows example personal video calls suspended temporarily favour emergency consultation 
noted admission control mechanism aim entirely eliminate need short term adaptation application performance deal transient changes resource availability 
seeks minimise amount adaptation required converging quickly near optimal operating point application providing minimum guaranteed level service 
implements transactional reconfiguration mechanism ensure applications left consistent state reconfiguration minimise glitches loss temporal integrity occur reconfiguration live running media streams

active badge system consists network infrared sensors deployed building detect badges worn people attached mobile equipment 
badges small tags carry name picture individual doubling identification tags 
badges receive signals sensors acting pagers simply means attract wearer attention 
unfortunately features active badge technology limit usefulness tracking system 
firstly badge sightings give information containment absolute location sighting indicates badge space visible sensor position badge space
