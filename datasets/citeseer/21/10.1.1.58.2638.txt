metadata advantages centralizing metadata audio content 
metadata possible descriptions linked audio content allow users compare algorithm 
different researchers working problem increase benchmark database size adding ground truth data 
common repository help discover synergies automatically extracted descriptors 
instance studying chord segmentation benefit results beat tracker 
somebody studying structure music benefit results tempo evolution chord progression singing voice detection 
centralized correctly labeled repository stimulate corpus oriented research statistical methods learning techniques 
instance finding correlations certain low level descriptors genres studying performance key extractor data different classical periods baroque easier 
taxonomies metadata important store taxonomies ontologies 
development percussive instrument classifier requires definition taxonomy classification scheme categories percussive instruments 
happens cases taxonomies musical genres voice types singing styles playing modes 
spending ph thesis time researching specific topic organized taxonomy ontology describes concepts specific topic 
imperative preserve knowledge 
legacy metadata may refer terms ontologies 
want reuse metadata need know exactly restricted vocabulary meaning term 
metadata specified comprehensible men computers alike
