methodology user studies participants studies performed question driven information finding large canadian government websites 
goal directed finding information common information seeking tasks web accounting 
participants asked find single web page containing information specified questions 
sample question find addresses passport offices ontario 
participants asked navigate page web browser window search engine 
study ta talk aloud fourteen adults females males tested separately 
participant answered questions participants 
asked talk aloud navigating 
time limit finding answer questions

measures simple navigation metrics simple metrics number web pages visited session number unique web pages visited time spent web page total time question obtained directly web session logs 
properties user web navigation graph nodes graph see example individual pages traversed 
measures shape graph calculated stratum compactness 
compactness refers connectedness graph varies zero close zero sparsely linked graphs close highly connected graphs 
stratum measures close navigation path linear ordering 
compactness stratum varies zero 
stratum close zero indicates linear navigation path stratum close indicates nearly linear navigation path 
similarity optimal path defined optimal path shortest path page containing desired information 
assumed path existed question path unique 
similarity measures calculated procedure needleman wunsch uses global sequence alignment algorithm non zero gap cost arbitrary distance function 
normalized similarity score user path optimal path 
ratio length longest common subsequence user optimal paths user path length

discussion similarity optimal path predictor task success navigational tasks employed 
tasks goal directed search may yield different results 
depending task notion optimal path sense optimal path exist similarity metrics ill defined 
success may depend user finding set paths situations may better characterized considering shape compactness stratum exploration path 
higher values stratum typically lower values compactness tend associated higher probability task success 
finding opposite 
necessary contradiction different navigational task learning hypertext handbook requires different navigation strategy 
viability search strategy probably contingent information seeking task 

appropriate metrics provide useful characterizations user web navigation behavior diagnose variety problems getting lost finding desired information 
ability predict task outcomes precision extremely useful practice 
needs done define select best metrics 
effective diagnostics great assistance building adaptive web solutions
