tracking approach 
group tracking real group people defined set persons close 
detect real groups people structure call group 
group structure set moving regions characterised particularities size coherence moving region group dimensions person bigger persons partially 
spatial coherence moving regions inside group close 
temporal coherence speed moving regions inside group exceed speed person 
structure coherence number size moving regions inside group stable 
person goes away real group come back times moving region corresponding person stay inside group structure order compute stable behaviour analysis real group 
main problems tracking groups appearance disappearance real groups real group appear disappear observed scene 
dynamic real groups persons groups come merge existing group leave 
motion detector failure persons detected moving region head body detected different moving regions labelled person
