increasing demand linguistic resources consisting substantial amounts data presents challenge building computational infrastructures capable handling unprecedented amounts information 
corpora size reached frontier especially consider potential constructing corpora pooling different resources spread globe 
proper management corpus demanding task terms technological infrastructure human resources 
document retrieval formatting corpus management software design maintenance large amounts data extremely demanding tasks difficult perform satisfactory way single organisation 
solution need huge amounts data proposed team kilgarriff scholars pointed klein raw documents internet presents major drawbacks linguistically noisy especially terms representativeness 
due extremely heterogeneous nature online documents linguistic accuracy amount raw data generally poor 
widespread presence scripts programs internet sources corrupt reliability query results affect global statistics derived 
scholars biber pointed representativeness source data matters terms linguistic inquiry terms statistical information 
internet provide sample actual language extremely high quantity available data principle hide reduce bias introduced phenomena language investigation
