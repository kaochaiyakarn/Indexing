increasing storage capacities current pcs searching world wide web ironically efficient searching personal computer 
introduced desktop search engines step coping problem satisfying solution 
reason desktop search quite different web counterpart 
documents desktop linked way comparable web means result ranking poor algorithms pagerank desktop search 
hand desktop search potentially profit lot implicit explicit semantic information available emails folder hierarchies browser cache contexts 
investigates extract store activity context information explicitly rdf metadata additional background information ontologies enhance desktop search 
capacity hard disk drives increased tremendously past decade number files usually store computer 
wonder find document know saved 
ironically quite cases nowadays document looking faster world wide web personal computer 
web search efficient pc search due boom web search engines due powerful ranking algorithms pagerank algorithm introduced google 
arrival desktop search applications index data pc promises increase search efficiency desktop 
search applications weaker web counterparts rely ranking mechanisms revolutionized web search 
unfortunately fall short utilizing desktop specific characteristics especially context information 
missed opportunities include email context utilized existing search algorithms clearly drops useful information 
example email contain question describing object looking email thread include answer question form attached document 
email attachments lose contextual information soon stored pc emails usually include additional information attachments sender subject comments 
discuss colleague brainstorming session send electronic version email helpful comments 
colleague remember details recall discussed question raised discussion included comment email 
helpful find stored content associatively context folder hierarchies barely utilized search algorithms spent considerable time build sophisticated classification hierarchies documents store 
example pictures taken hanover probably stored directory entitled germany lower hanover nice utilize information search pictures 
browser caches include information user browsing behaviour useful finding relevant results example remember find project home page corresponding api specification providing additional context results 
useful search application returns specific scientific downloaded citeseer repository referenced referring papers downloaded occasion

exploiting mail context scenario 
alice interested distributed page ranking advisor asked write report summarize state art research area 
remembers month discussed colleague distributed pagerank algorithm colleague sent article email 
article mention distributed pagerank talks distributed trust networks basically equivalent distributed pagerank colleague remarked email 
obviously able find article additional information 
context metadata 
aspects relevant email context 
sender receiver fields email clearly relevant pieces information 
information captured analyze date email reply field gives thread information useful determine social network information general example people discussed topic metadata generated automatically user works 
example email received system automatically generates email rdf metadata instantiating comment metadata email fields associating document attached email 
fig 

email prototype useful rdfs ontologies 
basic properties context properties referring date email sent date accessed subject email email body 
status email described seen unseen read unread 
property type reply represents thread information 
attachment property describes relation mail attachments 
properties connect class connects class person 
person usually associated instances 
attachments keep connection email saved search attachment want attributes originally connected email attached 
stored attribute inverse relation file stored property see 
corresponding association rules 
association rules infer materialize additional metadata information 
example creating annotations stored file associate subject derived subject email file attached 
corresponding association rule written datalog style looks follows subject ile subject stored attachment ile attachment mail attachment subject mail subject 
similarly associate date body text attached documents accessed ile date stored attachment ile attachment mail attachment accessed mail date 
body ile body stored attachment ile attachment mail attachment body mail body 
name sender original email ile name stored attachment ile attachment mail attachment mail belongs erson name erson name email threads connected reply relationship inherit email subjects bodies addition original email subject body subject mail subject 
subject mail subject reply mail mail subject mail subject 
body mail body 
body mail body reply mail mail body mail body 
note association rules generate materialize appropriate metadata query evaluated materialized metadata directly search similar full text file document 
example retrieve correct document body text sender information associated document inherited original email 
exploiting file hierarchy context scenario 
second scenario alex spent holiday hanover germany lot digital pictures 
usually saves pictures trip folder named city region visits 
time rename image file names ones camera example dsc jpg 
forgets directory name ordinary search retrieve pictures word remembers germany appear file names directory structure 
certainly useful enhanced desktop search pictures germany retrieve hanover pictures 
context metadata 
example need consider file type directory name information need able go simple keyword search part relationships synonyms account 
enrich context metadata provided file directory names wordnet lexical system contains english nouns verbs adjectives adverbs organized synonym sets representing underlying lexical concept 
different relations link synonym sets 
case additional relationships hypernym designates class specific instances 
hypernym kind holonym designates superset object 
holonym part synonyms set words interchangeable context 
synonym substitute certain context altering meaning

file prototype useful rdfs ontologies 
obviously context metadata files include basic file properties date access creation file owner 
file types inferred automatically provide useful information case file type jpeg image data 
additionally file visited web page stored computer attachment saved email 
stored property great importance represents information current file systems provenance information 
keep track file path including directory structure 
extend strings name type metadata wordnet information synonyms hypernyms 
term add information provided wordnet order enrich context stored file 
corresponding association rules 
wordnet induces association rules name ile string name ile string synonym string string 
name ile string name ile string holonym string string
