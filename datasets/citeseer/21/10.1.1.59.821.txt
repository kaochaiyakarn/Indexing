remainder section presents approach taken allow gradually building trust peers promote sharing system 
multicast communication sgl allows group peers communicate securely 
peers participate handshake protocol results derivation group shared secret key encrypt protect messages 
sgl specification allows extensions authentication mechanism 
pluggable authentication managers initial phase sgl handshake protocol called hello phase 
peer authentication manager presents peer credentials sgl collects credentials peers attempting join group determines set eligible peers may proceed handshake 
define secure multicast channel tuple ip address port locator public key 
channel administrator may user information sharing application creates channel configuration policy ccp 
administrator signs ccp secured private key 
peer interested joining group obtains channel tuple offline methods uses locator retrieve ccp verifies ccp public key 
important note peer performs steps attempting join channel ccp part authorization data sent hello phase 
ccp contains serial number allows peer detect case ccp received group 
scenario occur peers downloaded latest ccp resolved simply picking ccp highest serial number 
consequently peers security operational parameters 
particular authentication method trusted cas listed ccp determine trustworthiness peers 
normally untrusted peers part phase sgl handshake join group 
order allow gradual build trust solution uses sgl channels separate ccp 
channel secure encrypted allows trusted peers know group key referred trusted channel secure allows pseudo certificate join referred untrusted channel 
peers satisfy policies defined administrator admitted trusted channel 
order distinguish peers privileges channel uses akenti capabilities contain certificate peer certificate order verify right join group 
section describes authentication method detail 
peer admitted untrusted channel

sgl level authentication managers accept peer presents valid chain proof possession corresponding private key 
application level handshake complete peer performs trust check cas trusts

fine grained access control section fine grained access control mechanisms allow trusted peers different privileges 
identified resources system 
multicast communication channel shared information content metadata 
sharing resources large dynamic peer communities may span number trust domains highly controlled 
user able define clear secure manner just shared 
seen previous section sgl tls perform coarse grained access control provide equal access authenticated peers 
akenti authorization system basis fine grained access control scales large dynamic populations 
akenti engine allows multiple distributed resource owners supports powerful ways express constraints resources 
furthermore uses minimal centralized knowledge securely collect distributed policy form certificates evaluation phase 
dynamic policy collection enables akenti scale large cross domain populations terms policy management terms peers joining leaving forcibly organizations 
section introduce design fine grained access control multicast communication 
fully integrated group authorization model developed secure access shared content metadata 
multicast channel section showed ccp sure peers consistent way configuring sgl channel runtime certificates may authentication 
minor modifications authentication method akenti capabilities provide peers different levels access trusted channel 
owners channel necessarily peers generate deploy authorization policy 
system set correctly minimal policy elements kept central site 
policy elements change frequently resource usage constraints deployed sites conveniently accessible owners 
akenti engine uses minimal central knowledge collect dynamic policy elements runtime 
policy elements collected engine evaluates privileges peer produces capability certificates trusted eligible peers 
capability certificates signed akenti engine contain name associated peer typically user peer public key name channel list rights actions awarded named peer 
actions may additional applicationspecific conditions attached time period action valid 
channel authentication managers ccp capability certificates sgl behalf peers 
verify integrity received capabilities akenti engine public key conveniently contained ccp verify identity peers public keys contained capability certificates 
possible actions granted peers join invite escort attend reject 
join action allows peer join sgl group full fledged member attend action allows peer join sgl group guest 
peer join attend action listed capability order access channel 
peer granted invite action called inviting peer may allow peers join sgl group guests 
inviting peer provides potential guest signed invitation form capability certificate listing attend actions capability 
guest presents chain invitation chaining allowed certificates sgl handshake 
peer able verify validity invitation having contact inviting peer 
peer granted escort action called peer may allow peers join sgl group guests 
case peer participate sgl handshake guest admitted group 
guest peers follow steps case invitation 
change peer needs sure peer handshake 
peer granted reject action may remove peer sgl channel forcing re key operation presenting negative capability certificate peer removed 
negative capability certificate names peer list action 
summary channel owners specify peers join trusted channel 
peers may capability invite untrusted peers trusted channel experience 
flexibility essential forming secure spontaneous collaborations 
information hide complexities akenti policy language providing group authorization model layered user akenti 
currently policy simply named container holds set groups set rejected peers 
akenti engine asserts peer satisfies policy conditions satisfied 
peer listed rejected peer list 

peer belongs listed groups policy list groups 
group named set peers managed authorities assert peers belong group 
peers create groups groups created peers third party entities 
peer group available storing group membership certificate public directories 
peers groups policies create simply supplying owner group location public directories containing group information 
akenti engine asserts peer belongs referenced group engine locates listed public directories peer valid group membership certificate 
consequently peers added removed groups communication peers 
peer wants access resource simply retrieve relevant policy resource policy mapping managed peer evaluate peer privileges policy 
system resources hierarchical peer satisfy policy hierarchy
