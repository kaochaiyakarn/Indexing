surprising consider instance yahoo news audience millions users 
internet complements television news coverage provides different perspective greater depth information statistics pictures interactive maps streaming video analyst comments said peter nielsen 
certainly events sars war iraq terrorism alerts similar dramatic events contributed diffuse online news search engines 
huge amount news articles available online reflects users need plurality information opinions
