rely neighbor monitoring dynamically assess trustworthiness neighbor nodes excluding untrustworthy nodes 
reputation systems proposed mitigate selfishness stimulate cooperation mobile ad hoc network including confidant core ocean confidant buchegger boudec reputation protocol called confidant making misbehavior unattractive 
stands cooperation nodes fairness dynamic ad hoc network works extension demand routing protocols 
confidant aims detecting isolating uncooperative nodes making unattractive deny cooperation 
nodes rely passive observation packets hop neighborhood 
confidant node components monitor trust manager reputation system path manager 
components interact provide process protocol information

monitor reports suspicious events incoming alarm messages trust manager 
trust manager decisions providing accepting route information accepting node part route part route originated node 
consists components alarm table containing information received alarms 
trust table managing trust levels nodes determine trustworthiness alarm 
friends list containing friends node may sends alarms 
alarm messages contains type frequency protocol violations sent trust manager node warn malicious nodes 
outgoing alarm messages generated node having experienced observed received report malicious behavior 
recipients alarm messages called friends administered friends list 
incoming alarm messages originated outside friends nodes source alarm checked trustworthiness triggering reaction 
reputation system protocol manages table consisting entries nodes rating 
rating changed sufficient evidence malicious behavior significant node occurred number times exceeding threshold rule coincidences 
avoid centralized rating local rating lists black lists maintained node potentially exchanged friends 
path manager performs functions path re ranking reputation nodes path deletion paths containing malicious nodes action receiving request route malicious node ignore send reply action receiving request route containing malicious node source route ignore alter source 
node monitors behavior neighbors 
suspicious event detected information reputation system

rating turns intolerable information relayed path manager proceeds delete routes containing misbehaving node path cache 
buchegger improved confidant protocol cope false disseminated reputation information 
trust rating introduced represent trustworthiness node 
addition reputation rating node maintains trust rating node hand information neighbors 
hand information disseminated reputation rating trust rating published updated accordingly 
second hand reputation information compatible current reputation rating accepted

global vs local reputation reputation systems mobile ad hoc network uses global reputation node knows reputation node network

indirect reputation information may untrustworthy node reputation systems global reputation information suffer false rating false accusation false praise 
issues global reputation mechanism include 
node maintains reputation values node storing information requires storage node 
take confidant core example node maintain reputation information number nodes network 

disseminate reputation information greatly increases volume network traffic 
confidant core reputation message distributed reputation disseminate period number nodes network 
consider mobile ad hoc network bandwidth limited important issue 

time node receives indirect reputation information decide accept 
information accepted incorporated reputation table updated 
causes additional computation node 

reputation information data packet modified replayed accidentally lost transmission 
discussed global reputation methods unreliable complex distributing reputation information cause additional expense node network 
global reputation really necessary 
answer 
may argue global reputation helpful node moves network 
behaved node mean behave moves place 
example malicious node may build reputation moves certain location behave maliciously 
furthermore nodes usually care reputation distant nodes 
concerned reputation nodes neighborhood care local reputation global reputation 
ocean uses local reputation direct hand observations neighbors 
second hand reputation exchanges disallowed 
simulation ocean achieves reasonable performance terms network throughput complex vulnerable false accusations 
compare global reputation local reputation mechanism low cost reliable efficient 
initiate reputation value new node enters network node moves new location knows reputation initial reputation value 
reputation system learning period network know new node behave 
assign lowest possible reputation value new node force perform positive gain reputation discourage new participants malicious behavior 
mechanism may feasible ad hoc network instantaneous connection required nodes mobile 
may take time new node establish reputation 
assigning null value reasonable approach confidant core ocean allocate neutral reputations new nodes 
inconsistent reputation value reputation systems different nodes may different reputation values node 
called inconsistent reputation problem 
may caused reasons 
nodes may calculate reputation values differently 
example core confidant reputation value node combination ratings network functions applied functional reputation values 
reputation mechanisms usually assume node assign weights functions 
potentially inappropriate assumption mobile ad hoc network nodes different capabilities roles place different levels importance different functions 
different nodes hand reputation values node may vary 
node gets hand reputation information nodes interact experience 
node may behave differently interact different nodes reputation value node may vary 
example nodes interact node may different reputation values possible react differently request may interact 
node deals received indirect reputation information judgement 
results difference 
reputation information accepted node may accepted node incompatible experience trust sender 
reputation methods discussed require nodes mobile ad hoc network reach consensus nodes misbehave 
problem caused inconsistent reputation value nodes network may different ratings 
node may considered regular nodes considered misbehaved 
hard distinguish correct reputation ratings false reputation message problem especially important indirect reputation message distributed global reputation value calculated 
detection misbehavior tracing fault order reputation values valid nodes need reliable way detecting bad behavior 
confidant core ocean rely promiscuous observation monitoring function operations 
passive observation presents weaknesses mobile ad hoc network detect misbehaving node presence packet forwarding listens packet forwarding multiple hops watchdog mechanism 

ambiguous collision 
shown ambiguous collusion scenario packet collision occurs listening forward packet 

receiver collisions 
example tell sends packet tell receives 

limited transmission power signal strong overheard previous node weak received true recipient 

collusion multiple nodes collusion mount sophisticated attack 
example forwards packet report drops packet 

partial dropping node dropping packets lower rate configured minimum misbehavior threshold 
reaction uncooperative behavior uncooperative node identified isolated exclude network 
usually neighbors uncooperative node refuse forward packets originated node network services 
function mobile ad hoc network depends participate nodes 
objective force nodes cooperate benefit 
uncooperative node punished temporally chance behave normal 
ocean uses second chance mechanism allow nodes previously considered misleading useful 
uses approach uncooperative node accepted network fixed period observed inactivity 
rating node changed quickly detected misbehavior continues
