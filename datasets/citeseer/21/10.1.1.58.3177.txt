emergent semantic web community needs common infrastructure testing scalability quality new techniques software machine processable data 
ontologies approaches believe accurate evaluation tools quality scalability performance research community needs freely available ontology large description base 
tools advanced semantic applications business intelligence national security instances knowledge base highly interconnected 
propose describe semantic web technology evaluation ontology test bed 
particular address requirements test bed support research semantic analytics steps development including ontology creation semi automatic data extraction entity disambiguation 

considering ontology tools question arises test compare 
similarly applications utilize ontologies inference semantic integration semantic analytics require benchmark quality scalability performance evaluations 
emergent semantic web community needs common infrastructure testing evaluations 
particular feel need large high quality test ontology various ontology tools assess test scalability properties 
particular interest just schema ontology population instances assertions description base ontology 
highly populated ontology ontology instances assertions critical assessing effectiveness scalability core semantic techniques semantic disambiguation reasoning discovery techniques 
ontology population identified key enabler practical semantic applications industry example reports typical commercially developed ontologies objects 
far ontologies available research community 
important factor related population ontology possible capture instances highly connected knowledge base deep inter entity relationships 
allow detailed analysis current semantic tools applications especially exploit way entities related 
exemplified project new complex semantic relationships queried dis covered traversing sequence links entities interest 
clearly ontology corresponding knowledge base real world scale needed benchmark evaluating comparing tools techniques 
propose semantic web technology evaluation ontology captures real world knowledge tens classes populated growing set relevant facts currently instances part creation adopted iterative process allows periodic extension ontology instances designing schema ontology design toolkit detailed ii identifying knowledge sources populate parts focusing specific domain iii utilizing extractors written humans toolkit periodically automatically extract parts knowledge various open public sources iv semi automatically applying disambiguation techniques extracted instances ontology limited human involvement eliminate redundancies improve quality knowledge base www com lsdis cs uga edu projects index php lsdis cs uga edu proj providing capabilities exporting instances internal representation world wide web consortium standards owl rdf allowing open :10.1.1.44.6030
remaining sections organized follows section details related area section describes methodology approach creation section presents current results section provides directions 

related due infancy semantic web little research focused development evaluation benchmark test bed 
current ongoing effort tap provides large knowledge base annotated rdf described shallow broad knowledge base 
differs provide smaller schema larger number instances highly interconnected 
additionally provide option serialize ontology owl allowing constraints expressiveness schema level 

methodology ontology incorporates instances extracted heterogeneous sources automatic population created extractors detailed section 

ontology creation test bed created bottom fashion data sources dictate classes relationships defined ontology similar spirit concept emergent semantics 
illustrate example consider listing people computer science department 
typically listed separately faculty students staff 
cases create appropriate classes ontology populate instances 
ontology created freedom commercial product evolved lsdis lab past research semantic interoperability score technology 
freedom toolkit allows creation ontology user define classes relationships involved graphical environment 
user relieved burden serializing ontology owl syntax 

selection data sources creation solid test bed requires selection data sources 
focused selection data sources considering factors selecting sources highly reliable web sites provide entities semi structured format unstructured data parse able structures html pages tables dynamic web sites database back ends 
addition freedom toolkit useful capabilities focused crawling exploiting structure web pages directories 
ii carefully considered types quantity relationships available data source 
preferred sources instances interconnected 
iii considered sources entities rich metadata 
example person entity data source provides attributes gender address place birth 
iv public open sources preferred government web sites academic sources desire openly available 

knowledge extraction knowledge facts populate ontology extracted freedom software 
essentially extractors created freedom environment regular expressions written extract text standard html semi structured xml database driven web pages 
web pages analyzed name spotting freedom extractors extracted entities stored appropriate classes ontology 
additionally provenance information including source time date extraction maintained extracted data 
utilize freedom api exporting ontology instances rdf owl syntax :10.1.1.44.6030
keeping knowledge base date extractors scheduled rerun user specified time date intervals 
automatic data extraction insertion knowledge base raise issues related highly researched area entity disambiguation 
focused greatly aspect ontology population 
freedom entity instances disambiguated syntactic matches similarities aliases customizable ranking rules relationship similarities entities 
freedom able automatically disambiguate entities extracted 
furthermore freedom detects ambiguity new entities knowledge base unable disambiguate preset degree certainty entities flagged manual disambiguation system help possible matches 
lastly special cases software humans directly determine entities 
example consider persons named john smith 
metadata attributes system humans determine looking entity name 
research direction wish follow semantic similarity state degree certainty persons john smith fact person 
remove types entities knowledge base order maintain consistency
