van der weide january detailed knowledge collection users find difficult formulate effective queries 
fact observed web search engines users may spend large amounts time reformulating queries order satisfy information need 
proven successful method overcome difficulty treat query initial attempt retrieve information construct new hopefully better query 
way improve query global thesauri information 
article new hybrid approach projects initial query result global information leading local conceptual overview 
resulting concepts candidates query refinement 
show effectiveness show conceptual structure resulting typical short query terms contains refinements perform accurate query formulation 
show query navigation effective mechanism cases finds optimal concept small number steps 
optimal concept finds acceptable sub optimum 
show proposed method compares favorably existing techniques 
formulating queries simple task 
searchers searching strategy search engine contribution recall searcher concerned precision see example 
typically searchers carefully select small number keywords describe information need 
queries referred short queries 
example reported excite web search engine average number terms query amounted 
searcher challenged finding small combination discriminating keywords 
especially critical searcher familiar actual description relevant documents 
problem short queries usually large degree ambiguity 
query result adequate short query seen indication lowerbound query formulation expressiveness 
full text queries trec ad hoc evaluations see appendix may seen accurate formulation information need 
balanced cover kinds details relevance searcher 
interpret results queries indication upperbound query formulation expressiveness 
try bridge gap lowerbound upperbound offer mechanism help searcher go upperbound formulation expressiveness 
order solve problem query result interpreted materialized meaning assignment query see 
case ambiguity query result mix various interpretations query 
non ambiguous queries may lead better formulation information need refining query elements meaning 
case ambiguity refinement process starts selection intended particular meaning variant 
directions chosen handle query refinement problem 
shortly discuss extensional approach intentional approach collaborative approach 
weather related 
document report type weather event directly caused location 
relevant document include number people killed injured weather event reporting type weather event location event 
trec query 
extensional approach materialization information need terms documents 
query enrichment method may done user intervention example relevance feedback user intervention called local analysis 
case relevance feedback searcher may asked assign relevance judgements number documents 
approach ask searcher indicate highest ranked relevant document 

intentional approach meaning keywords 
thesauri describe meaning relations terms 
locating short query thesaurus reformulation query obtained 
thesaurus may underlying collection world knowledge wordnet 
case restricted area interest representative collection may serve meaning framework area interest 

collaborative approach system tries employ previous behavior searchers obtain better idea intended meaning query 
see example 
employ mix extensional intentional approach 
discuss hybrid form query expansion called conceptual query expansion 
approach local initial query result global information complete collection 
conceptual structure resulting global collection information project structure local initial query result 
resulting concepts may seen structured overview various interpretations query 
experiments trec associated press collection automatically generated index expressions describe contents documents 
mechanism better suitable word combinations 
reason finds word combinations go word position sentence 
index expressions connector clarify relation combined words 
lead better quality generated concepts 
index expressions effectively obtained text high level precision parser technique 
assumption best ranked documents initial query result form proper basis generate local thesaurus 
top ranked document relevant searcher address topics query 
top ranked documents may map meaning structure associated query reasonable extent 
order investigate principle get impression potentials restrict benefits single document top ranked document 
experiments consider effect highest ranked relevant document 
generating local thesaurus projecting global thesaurus top ranked document obtain conceptual sub structure 
argue concept structure relates specific meaningful query expansion 
problem find best concept related query expansion 
important result experiments local thesaurus contains concepts approximate full text formulation upperbound see section 
consequence local thesaurus reasonable framework query expansion 
simple heuristic locate nearly optimal concept obvious 
practice searcher may navigate local thesaurus query navigation see locate best suitable concept 
illustrate power mechanism simulated searcher perform process query navigation 
experiments show searcher effectively locate best concept navigation steps 
usually searcher takes straight course
