geospatial semantic web section provide ontologies postal addresses

note semantics centroids polygons street front center points building entrance points simply arbitrary points inside polygons 
address files exist calculated street network datasets 
street segments contain typically attributes representing house number intervals sides segment

note case geocode represents point street network necessarily inside boundary polygon 
typically point route planning requires dynamic segmentation street network
