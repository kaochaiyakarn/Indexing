step maps boolean query node lattice second step builds display set parents children node determined earlier step 
step carried computing set documents satisfy query extent lattice node corresponding query determining set terms possessed previously documents intent lattice node corresponding query 
simple common case query consists conjunction terms lattice node associated query assuming set query terms dit dit

section examine relation turn 
cleverdon proposed approach supporting interactive reformulation boolean queries named quorum level searches 
starting clause containing terms user may choose new query level query hierarchy level disjunction clauses obtained removing terms original top clause 
query hierarchy may drive user narrow broader formulations initial conjunctive query vein proposed systematic powerful approach 
describes infocrystal system computes users prefer simple conjunctive queries suggested studies similar technique different goal help assessors evaluate recall large databases 
display result terms number documents possible boolean queries normal form involve terms user query 
method advantage applied boolean expressions conjunctive queries quorum level searches 
approaches meaning proposed reformulations may difficult understand user 
refiner reformulation obtained deleting terms query enlargement adding new terms query refinement reformulation shown infocrystal quorum level search contains terms user query connected different operators different precedences 
queries displayed systems may semantically distant search query utilization may obvious user 
instance set reformulations produced infocrystal response query contain query 
raises question system retrieval effectiveness experimental evidence fact reported 
limitation infocrystal scale query contains terms build display queries 
refiner quorum level search infocrystal help user select relevant terms document collection 
third approach supporting users boolean retrieval fire 
fire provides main kinds support terminological help strategic help 
terminological help consists new system generated terms expanding refining user query 
fire source terms proposed user manually constructed thesaurus explicit relation content database searched 
contrast refiner new queries suggested systems actual refinement user query respect database 
strategic help provided fire set rules modifying constituents boolean expression including terms operators precedence users faces adverse situation 
respect fire powerful refiner certain kinds strategic help easily deduced refiner display screen 
instance query produces empty output refiner shows minimal query non empty answer set 
brajnik compared performance automatic support query reformulation versus non automatic support printed thesaurus human expert interested evaluating enhanced boolean retrieval system perform better basic boolean system 
great deal research hybrid approaches concentrated combination browsing querying styles interaction 
browsing generally seen aid conventional query retrieval alternative search method 
approach described search term space improve query formulation distinct document space 
example second approach hierarchical browsing system supplements boolean query system 
systems network supports browsing usually developed maintained distinct component 
main drawback retrieval architectures user map different concept representations data spaces 
refiner contrast integrates browsing querying single term document space 
advantage user may combine query refinement direct inspection document database 
users commit specific retrieval mode may exhibit continuum behaviors varying querying browsing characterized level specificity information seeking goals 
application concept lattices information retrieval explored :10.1.1.47.800
systems build concept lattice associated document term relation employ various methods access relevant information including possibility user search terms user specified 
systems severely affected computational requirements build entire concept lattices applied databases modest size document described small number index terms 
contrast refiner builds relevant portion lattice allows full text indexing databases 
furthermore refiner combines potentials lattice inspection great expressive power boolean retrieval query mode systems described inherently limited 
improving cooperative behaviour information systems done fields database query answering systems logic programming deductive databases see review 
common concern recover failing query query producing empty answer set extending relational deductive database systems facilities find minimal failing maximal succeeding minimal conflicting subqueries 
compared approach done area relies different assumptions structured data powerful query languages versus unstructured data simple query languages different scope 
library searches convenient consider query enlargement query refinement database querying useful concentrate ways recover failing queries seen special case query enlargement considering implicit causes failure violation integrity constraints 
refiner approach combining boolean retrieval content navigation concept lattices 
main advantage system suggests controlled ways refining enlarging conjunctive boolean query 
additional distinguishing feature refiner combines querying browsing styles interaction user may choose hybrid retrieval strategy continuum ranging casual inspection highly specific information seeking goals 
compared refiner retrieval effectiveness conventional boolean retrieval system subject searching task 
results suggest performance query refinement enhanced boolean retrieval may better unrefined boolean retrieval especially respect search time databases non trivial size 
research extended directions 
fundamental design choice refiner size topology lattice region built displayed response query 
current version refiner shows set parents children focus node advanced visualization techniques fisheye views show distant ancestors descendants nodes directly comparable focus siblings 
clear small region efficient build large region shows refinements contains information content database 
hand clear larger region automatically result better retrieval performance may increase cognitive overload user disorientation 
currently exploring fundamental trade offs 
related research issue concerns scope approach 
experiment performed provides results taken indicative 
suggested factor needs controlled evaluate system efficiency effectiveness characteristics lattice region displayed visual interface 
operational situations may important parameters need controlled 
direction perform experiments evaluate performance results change controlling wider range factors including database scale indexing strategies characteristics domain users
