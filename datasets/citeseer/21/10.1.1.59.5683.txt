social dilemmas arise group benefit members certain choice members incentive opposite choice 
consider fishing lake 
fishes limit lake soon empty community benefits people limit catch

rest free riders enjoying benefits cost 
people free ride public provided community benefit produced 
free rides 
experiments shown people contribute public goods conditions 
social psychologists study related problem social observation people expend effort working group 
researchers proposed number accounts social 
example kerr blames free riding 
suggests specifically people hard evaluate individual contributions 
collective effort model williams integrate accounts social collective effort model general model understanding people motivated contribute groups 
model see expectancy value account motivation 
account suggests motivation effort depends effort translates performance outcomes expected level performance lead outcomes valued 
model posits people consider factors individual group perspective

tried similar approach online discussion group telling people unique relevant information add conversation 
tactic increased contributions
