stage performs sorting substrings text finds length prefix parts adjacent substrings sorted table 
second stage calculation gram asked specific existing character combinations require table entries frequency count need reserve big space gram table

calculation grams arbitrary large number difficult calculate grams large number memory limitation computer 
example japanese language different characters want gram frequencies japanese text reserve entries exceed grams calculated far 
new method developed calculate grams arbitrary large number reasonable memory size reasonable calculation time
