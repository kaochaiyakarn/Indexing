high incidence breast cancer women especially developed countries increased significantly years 
disease clear reasons increased number cases 
currently methods prevent breast cancer early detection represents important factor cancer treatment allows reaching high survival rate 
mammography considered reliable method early detection cancer 
due high volume mammograms maria partially supported alberta ingenuity fund za ane partially funded nserc canada read physicians accuracy rate tends decrease automatic reading digital mammograms highly desirable 
proven double reading mammograms consecutive reading physicians increased accuracy high costs 
computer aided diagnosis systems necessary assist medical staff achieve high efficiency effectiveness 
methods proposed classify digital mammograms categories normal benign malign 
normal ones characterizing healthy patient benign ones represent mammograms showing tumor tumor formed cells malign ones mammograms taken patients tumors 
generally errors occur radiologist decide benign malign tumors 
mammography reading prove suspicious area malignant benign 
decide tissue removed examination breast techniques 
false positive detection causes unnecessary 
statistics show breast cases proven 
false negative detection actual tumor remains undetected lead higher costs cost patient life 
digital mammograms difficult medical images read due low contrast differences types tissues 
important visual clues breast cancer include preliminary signs masses clusters 
unfortunately early stages breast cancer signs subtle varied appearance making diagnosis difficult challenging specialists 
main reason development classification systems assist specialists medical institutions 
data physicians deal increased significantly great deal research done field medical images classification 
effort widely method classify medical images 
medical domain requires high accuracy 
mis classifications different consequences 
false negatives lead death false positives high cost cause detrimental effects patients 
automatic medical image classification rate false negatives low zero 
important mention manual classification medical images professionals prone errors accuracy far perfect 
important factor influences success automatic classification methods working team medical specialists desirable achievable 
consequences errors detection classification costly
