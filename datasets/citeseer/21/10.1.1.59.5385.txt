keywords mnemonics portable device interaction embodied interfaces mobile telephones personal digital assistants pdas handheld computers currently fastest growth areas computing 
existing devices limited input output capabilities making cumbersome hard mobile 
consequently current requirement field development new interaction techniques specifically designed mobile scenarios 
data devices commonly managed traditional desktop laptop computer mainly retrieve information mobile 
making retrieval easy quick possible essential interface design 
gestural interfaces demonstrated successful alternative physical screen buttons handheld devices 
typical interfaces involve shaking tilting device trigger different commands 
adopt related approach inertial sensing embedded portable device 
design concept looking command gestures propose system information stored body space

ask user think shoulder location information 
different way thinking historically established memory technique called method loci harnessed 
technique originally means long narratives 
architectural space mental model associating story fragments different rooms 
europe method adapted include body space 
different body positions markers remember lists computational system 
facilitate study interaction paradigm currently developing inertial sensing board fits expansion slot pda tracks motions device 
gesture common starting location system compare motions previously stored movement patterns triggering desired functionality
