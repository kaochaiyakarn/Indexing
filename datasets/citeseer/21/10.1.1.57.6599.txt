tree encoded rst encoding leaf nodes placing leaves input layer feeding activations hidden layer 
resulting hidden layer pattern represents leaf node input layer encode node belongs 
manner encoding tree built nal hidden layer pattern produced representing tree 
decode raam encoding tree encoding hidden layer activation fed forward output layer produces children top node 
may symbols hidden layer patterns decode 
decoding process ends symbols tree extracted 
raam trained layer feed forward network inputs form target outputs 
typically training algorithm back propagation
