overview tap tap project years attempted create platforms publishing consuming data semantic web 
platform built number applications validate assumptions help bootstrap semantic web 
building simplest toy applications requires substantial amount data 
unfortunately semantic web current stage little offer regard 
hand large body unstructured knowledge human readable world wide web 
solve problem bootstrap semantic web created large scale knowledge extraction aggregation system called 
tap includes html page templates able read extract knowledge different high quality web sites 
html template system currently read pages discovering entities asserting triples entities 
system aggregates data run dynamic mode response query application batch mode 
batch mode aggregator create classification index keyword queries scanning documents referenced entities

contextual phenomena section discuss contextual phenomena observed process building tap knowledge base cause problems data aggregation 
examples contextual phenomena observed classified small number varieties contexts

discuss handle cases aggregation 
class differences different sites particular class slightly different ways 
sites may differ meaning seemingly unambiguous concepts erson 
example site classifies po robot star wars person sites classify robot 
aggregation map erson general 
alternately believe say resource says contradicts site says 
propositional attitude related phenomenon site having implicit propositional attitude 
example sites providing reviews television shows specify character plays role president television series west wing president united states 
aggregation propositional attitude statements explicit 
property type differences common source differences sites property types capacity price differently 
example capacity nuclear power plants 
plants different kinds capacities design capacity actual capacity 
sites specify design capacity specify actual capacity cases just refer capacity 
aggregating need create generalization capacities determine capacity particular site referring map capacity site appropriate version capacity aggregate 
point view substantial differences occur conflicting points view 
taiwan country province china 
answer depends strongly site queried 
similarly different sites classify terrorist organization freedom fighting organization organization 
kind subjective data mixed objective data head capital taiwan 
aggregating data sites subjectivity explicit propositional attitudes selectively import facts contentious 
implicit time sites publish piece data true time publication temporal qualification left implicit 
equally data get updated longer holds 
number sites list bill clinton president refer yugoslavia country unfortunately implicitly temporally qualified data mixed data temporally qualified 
example true bill clinton graduated yale latitude longitude changed 
aggregating data sites time explicit selectively import facts changed 
similar phenomenon site leaving unit measure associated attribute value implicit 
specifying price simply say

approximations approximations source differences sites
