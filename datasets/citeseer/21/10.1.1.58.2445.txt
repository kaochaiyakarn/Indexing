usability affects size anonymity set matters security system 
ideal system described follows provides anonymous access sending information availability hiding information recipient sender identity anonymity maximum large set users incentives cooperate minimum degradation usable bandwidth response time performance 
evaluate mix cascades networks perform realising goals analyse impact flexibility routing task sharing mentioned aspects 
anonymity maximum anonymity provided mix cascades means senders recipients messages particular time interval mixes cooperate trace message intention sender recipient 
proof fact possibilistic probabilistic setting effects flexible routing anonymity described 
assuming globally listening participating adversary authors conclude mix route trustworthy achievable anonymity distinctly lower mix network compared synchronously working mix cascade 
thesis networks assume adversaries outside closed group people 
evident requirements anonymity service heavily depend threat model considered 
threat model senders recipients 
mixes deemed strong arguments modifying parameters replacing design 
anonymity level cascade downgraded reducing number mixes number messages required batch 
measures favourable side effects lead increase performance quality service 
second cascade design keeps advantages clear structure system contrast distributed approaches cascades easy analyse easy prove 
means system robust idea proof outlined document org talks pdf degree complexity systems apparently inspires researchers write fancy papers 
consequence complexity really important aspects regularly neglected exit policies simplified unrealistic assumptions low number small fraction resp colluding nodes 
mix cascades vs peer peer remaining threats information outside considered model 
third threat model changes stronger anonymity may required switching costs kept moderate levels cascade infrastructure set changing parameters far cheaper switching new topology 
task sharing dimension low number known mix servers mix cascades vulnerable adversaries try gain control servers :10.1.1.13.5636
cascade proponents argue symmetric task sharing networks dangerous peer nodes run users box operating systems 
combination withstand decent attacks compared dedicated mix servers security experts asymmetric case 
equal peers symmetric architecture forcing users change route 
frequent route switching increases probability time collusive nodes 
thesis proponents err assuming sheer number nodes implies minority 
thesis implications terms nodes terms links 
danger powerful attacker participating large set nodes quite understood 
measures proposed reputation systems attack difficult 
node necessarily need malicious owner bad intentions 
possible attacker selectively throws precisely nodes impede observation 
cited strength distributed systems denial service dos time attract active attackers just routes dynamically switched partial failures keep unnoticed

availability availability anonymity services includes steps possibility reach access point second correct operation mixes communication third accessibility requested information 
step concerns possible blocking efforts states organisations 
depending details filter method powerful blocker restrict access anonymity services 
obvious publicly known central access points vulnerable distributed networks 
concerning step symmetric systems dominate asymmetric ones protocols information network topology exploited block packet forwarding rarely addressed aspect literature 
second step robust symmetric structure denial service attacks hit large set peers central servers 
hme mix cascades equipped redundant backup servers 
addition professional administration mix servers vulnerable user run peers 
step probably difficult discuss 
peers white lists manage exit policies see probability get arbitrary information internet quite low 
institutionalised mixes cascades suppress access certain content depending respective jurisdiction

common implication researchers discuss usability performance aspects evaluate incentives participate 
aspects depend flexibility routing task sharing 
apart task sharing dimension responsibility exit nodes important point marginally addressed literature :10.1.1.13.5636
risk averse user accountable arbitrary crimes linkable ip address computer major drawback structures 
case say music industry participant anonymity service went public user base danger vanish 
risk participation major users intentions 
assume user restrict access limited amount obviously innocuous websites exit policies usually white lists cost managing policies exceed resources majority participants 
black lists completely evade risk demand huge effort keep date white lists 
probably exclude requested information network render system useless 
thesis systems receive support ample community 
masses mixes strong arguments suggest mix cascades 
talking masses means considering users individuals described spoiled reluctant 
apart said performance equally critical success factor 
performance proponents state centralised routes set upper limit service performance mix cascades perform worse 
statement true second needs consideration 
fact batch size general flushing strategy sets upper limit level anonymity service provide 
frequency packet arrivals determines response latency mix 
certain limit packets pass mix cascades vs peer peer mixes faster packets arrive 
mix cascades usually connected higher bandwidth distributed peers upper limit cascade far limited bandwidth nodes 
atypical relationship volume delay mix cascades dominate systems performance batch size 
thesis high load cascades leads reduced response latencies batch size 
reach capacity effects performs worse 
dummy traffic described effective measure prevent longterm intersection attacks 
designers systems suggest dummy traffic bandwidth reduce risk traffic analysis observing adversary 
dummy traffic adjacent mixes prevent attacks insiders mixes separate dummy packets real data 
dummy traffic indistinguishable real data routed multiple peers 
leads inefficiencies dummy packets definition indistinguishable treated quality service payload packets cause additional load critical bottlenecks network topology 
thesis insider adversary dummy traffic flexible routing systems useless jams connections 
cases performance suffers little reward 
summing arguments general level put points security cascade design proven little assumptions

mix cascades fragile comparison fully connected mix networks failures network interrupt service new routes unavailable nodes constructed route traffic 
fragility cascades susceptible denial service attacks

applies legal attacks sufficient operation node disrupt communications 
default fewer nodes participating cascade due traffic load legal attacks easier mount technical point view 
mix cascades vulnerable small minority insiders attempt disrupt service dropping packets flooding subsequent nodes 
rich literature exists cascade designs publicly verifiable rely extremely expensive cryptographic primitives extremely complex protocols

mix cascades require trust user mix networks user choose nodes wants trust add mix cascade 
symmetric systems vulnerable attacks asymmetric systems security level nodes lower 
contrary claims designs state fact having nodes network imply strong attacker able control significant number nodes
