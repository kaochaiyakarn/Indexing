main advantage ipsec authentication encryption facilities protect virtual peering

approaches possible 
approach vpc learn ebgp routes known border router 
ibgp session border router easy 
vpc measure quality ebgp route predefined criteria requesting border router perform latency bandwidth measurement technique 
instance measure latency routes maximum bandwidth available route 
result measurement vpc select single border router 
second approach consists establishing multiple tunnels 
vpc select multiple border routers serve tunnel head ends 
approach interesting sas multiple peerings providers located distant places 
case interesting setup tunnels departing peerings order favour hot potato routing

case border serve tunnel head packets sent prefix 
instance example fig 
learned ebgp route prefix tail router 
tunnel established border router advertises ibgp new route indicating reach destination prefix 
route higher value local pref attribute force ibgp neighbours prefer routes received outside virtual peering 
path advertisement contains path route border router uses reach tunnel tail 
ebgp routes reach tunnel tail may due bgp policies border router serve tunnel head packets sent prefix 
assume typical ip network fraction border routers able serve tunnel head ends 
example depend type interfaces installed router 
allow vpc know routers capable establishing virtual peering links assume router indicates igp link state packets originates types tunnels supports 
encoded capability defined 
link state database vpc easily determine capabilities border routers inside 
security considerations security viewpoint virtual peerings approach proposed section exhibits major issues 
message advertises global internet ip addresses attached prefix 
attacker modify content virtual peerings extended communities bgp advertisements passing transit router redirect virtual peering requests machine 
lead traffic redirection attacks 
noted attacker able modify bgp messages types attacks possible standard bgp deployed today 
order avoid problem best solution bgp extensions proposed allow authenticate bgp advertisements 
extensions possible solution ensure ip address vpc belongs advertised prefix 
second issue due 
receiving vpc able verify ras authorised advertise prefixes tunnel tail ends 
attacker easily redirect packets sent sas premisses tail ras 
verification publicly available address allocation registries ripe 
major isps notably europe databases filter routes advertised peers customers
