syntactic vs semantic cloaking syntactic cloaking considered unacceptable search engines 
example page sent crawler doesn contain advertising content php session identifier distinguish different real users problem search engines 
contrast acceptable cloaking define semantic cloaking cloaking behavior effect manipulating search engine results 
step cloaking study randomly selected pages pages detected syntactic cloaking pages manually checked percentage semantic cloaking 
practice difficult judge behavior harmful search engine rankings 
example web sites send login page browser send full page crawler 
categories acceptable cloaking unknown semantic cloaking 
pages classified pages semantic cloaking unknown acceptable cloaking 
different types cloaking process manually checking pages sections different types cloaking 
types term cloaking identified different methods sending different term content crawlers web browsers 
categorized magnitude difference 
consider case content pages sent crawler web browser quite different 
page provided crawler full detail web browser empty contains frames javascript 
web site sends text page crawler sends non text content macromedia flash content web browser 
page sent crawler incorporates content sent web browser contains redirect error response 
second case content differs partially pages sent crawler browser remaining content identical copy slightly content 
pages sent crawler contain text content ones web browser 
example page sent crawler contains keywords shown 
different redirection target urls contained pages sent crawler web browser 
web site sends different titles keywords crawler web browser 
example header browser uses shape things movie info video universe meta description crawler uses great prices shape things vhs movies video universe 
great service secure ordering fast shipping everyday discount prices page sent crawler contains javascript javascript sent browser pages different sent crawler web browser

case pages contain similar number links pages quite different number links 
situation examples include number links page sent crawler web browser corresponding link pairs different format 
example link web browser may contain php session id link crawler 
example page crawler contains absolute urls page browser contains relative urls fact pointing targets absolute ones 
links page crawler direct links corresponding links page web browser encoded redirections

example refresh tag may put inside tag browsers support javascript 
estimate number real redirection refresh tag randomly selected pages pages refresh tag checked manually 
real redirection inside tag 
pages may identical target url refresh tag keep refreshing 
counted numbers

step pages pages refresh tag refresh different page 
usually time value assigned refresh tag show long wait refreshing 
time small seconds users see origin page redirected new page immediately 
fetched time value pages draw distribution different time values range seconds seconds 
pages refresh different url seconds refresh second 
estimate real distribution javascript refresh method randomly selected pages pages identified candidates javascript redirection step 
manually checking files real redirections conditional redirections rest redirection purpose avoid showing percentage pages number seconds refresh distribution delays refresh

redirection cloaking mentioned section site may return pages redirecting different locations case different user agents 
consider redirection cloaking 
pairs pages pairs different response code crawler normal browser doing redirecting 
usually web sites send response code send response code 
pages different redirection method crawler normal web browser 
example may crawler refresh tag response code normal web browser 
summary discussion detection search engine spam challenging research area 
cloaking redirection impor tant spamming techniques 
study sample quarter pages top responses popular search engine hot queries web 
identified different kinds cloaking gave estimate percentage pages sample show estimation distribution different redirect 
issues see addressed 
bias dataset 
data sets pages near top results queries nearly reflect web 
argued reflects web important purposes finding pages affect search engine rankings cloaking 
second address ip cloaking pages provide content major engines recognize crawling ip 
welcome partnership search engine collaborate crawls 
final issue bottom line 
search engines may interested finding eliminating instances cloaking proposed technique requires crawls 
ideally technique incorporate stage approach identifies subset full web contain pages full crawl browser identity necessary 
hope study provide realistic view techniques contribute robust effective solutions identification search engine spam
