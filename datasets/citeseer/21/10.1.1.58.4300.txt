identifying synonyms important step development structured terminological databases 
number nature synonyms analyzed domain affect important design choices structured synonym sets synsets synonym constitute separate node hierarchy 
second normative function choose recommended form synset 
third construction multilingual synsets analyzed order decide connect synonyms languages 
experience trainers synonym identification basis subjective intuitions seen daunting task 
probably due fact synonymy hard define property clear cut boundaries 
example merriam webster line defines synonym words expressions language nearly meaning senses course extremely difficult develop robust intuitions explicit criteria decide meanings words near justify treating synonyms 
automated procedure identifies synonyms basis objective distributional grounds great help 
turney shown simple algorithm applied large corpus web performs remarkably task identifying synonym target word set candidates 
method compute mutual information pair words frequency cooccurrence frequency data extracted web altavista search engine rank www com www altavista com pairs basis score 
pairs high mutual information avmi score synonyms 
avmi method differs traditional approaches synonymy detection look context words occur simply direct cooccurrence 
simplicity approach counterbalanced fact statistics large corpus web 
fact avmi require annotated language resources specialized nlp tools particularly attractive method discover synonyms rapid multilingual development 
turney studied synonyms belonging general language 
automated synonym detection technical sub language harder task terms specialized domain tend certain degree semantically related 
study test validity avmi applied sub language english nautical terminology 
results promising indicating avmi approach extended terminological domain

context similarity cosine approach compared avmi standard contextual cosine similarity approach 
detailed discussion approach intuition similar words tend occur similar contexts see manning sch tze sec 

contextual similarity computed building vector collects frequencies cooccurrence target words words corpus subset 
cosine normalized contextual vectors dot product cos cosine ranges perfectly correlated vectors totally uncorrelated vectors perfectly inversely correlated vectors 
notice context methods require construction cooccurrence vectors target word comparison vectors harder scale large corpora similarity measures direct cooccurrence counts 
latent semantic analysis lsa particularly sophisticated computationally intensive version contextual similarity approach 
dimensionality reduction techniques lsa takes account cooccurrence words cooccurrence words similar 
landauer dumais applied lsa toefl synonym detection task success rate 
comparable performance average foreign test taker considerably lower success rates attained turney terra clarke respectively simpler algorithm larger corpus landauer dumais corpus words 
experiments computed cosine similarity scores collecting frequency counts corpora 
corpus described detail contains words documents hand picked web sources representativeness domain nautical terminology 
built larger corpus words automated queries random combinations nautical terms google search engine 
informal inspection documents corpus valid examples fair compare avmi knowledge free unsupervised measure

synonym pairs vs random pairs experiment avmi cosine similarity look synonyms random pairs terms domain 

test set word test set contains synonyms pairs included pairs bottom hull frames displacement weight pairs 
created re combining terms synonym set order control possible term specific effects 
remaining pairs constructed forming random couples nautical terms 
non synonym pairs belong domain topically related stronger semantic links 
running tests classified random pairs strongly semantically related vs strongly related basis intuition knowledge domain 
judged pairs formed strongly semantically related terms 
examples pairs include decks cockpit stern board install hatch coated underway cruising 
synonym detection setting clearly harder task non synonym pairs taken general vocabulary 

results discussion table reports percent precision recall levels various similarity measures 
tools build corpus available tools bernardini 
list contain pair categorized terms synonymy hyponymy standard relations recorded 
case ties treated synonym pairs ranked non synonym pairs 
avmi far best measure outperforming context measures avmi combination 
recall synonym pairs avmi precision non synonym pairs mixed synonyms 
promising result confirming direct cooccurrence method applied large corpus outperforms context method applied smaller corpora web large corpus true dealing terms specialized domain 
variants context approach ones narrower window perform better worse data scarcity problems big tails synonym pairs bottom list terms extremely sparse non overlapping vectors 
contextual measures derived corpus outperform web look top lists recall increases precision drops faster values close chance level reflecting quality quantity tradeoff expect smaller hand built corpus larger automatically constructed 
interestingly inspecting false positives pairs get recall level avmi list find pairs judged strongly semantically related see previous section 
higher proportion strongly related pairs list 
consistent portion rivals synonyms pairs strong semantic links kinds 
suggests mi method detecting semantic relations general synonymy particular 

synonym pairs vs semantically related pairs explore issue raised previous section ran second experiment test set modified systematically include types semantically related words 

test set added pairs test set described 
pairs bruce anchor mushroom anchor flexible tank rigid tank hypo hypernym pairs stern platform sun deck canopy antonyms ahead aboard 
hypo hypernym pairs include instances relations share term synonym pairs 
antonym pairs pairs type 
order maintain synonym ratio experiment removed randomly picked non synonym pairs test set 
repeated experiment removing different random subsets consistently obtained results similar report 

results discussion recall avmi cost cost comb table synonyms vs random pairs percentage precision recall levels 
recall avmi cost cost comb table synonyms vs random related pairs percentage precision recall levels 
table reports percent precision recall levels modified test set 
avmi best measure recall levels performance dropped dramatically 
confirms avmi finding semantically related terms general single synonyms strongly related terms 
drop performance due combined effect hypo hypernymy 
example top pairs ranked avmi list find synonym pairs pairs hypo hypernym pairs total pairs 
antonyms interfering synonym detection ranks respectively 
performance cosine combined measures drop avmi probably due effect 

study confirms effectiveness mi measured large corpus semantic similarity measure extending results turney terra clarke technical domain terms tend certain extent related task identifying similar terms harder 
results suggest avmi measure find semantically related pairs general synonyms particular 
impressive results turney terra clarke probably due fact synonym candidate sets true synonym word semantically related target 
turn avmi full fledged synonym mining technique necessary find ways filter types nyms results 
step performed manually discovery hyponymy seen particularly challenging task 
alternatively process filtering semantically related non synonyms automated
