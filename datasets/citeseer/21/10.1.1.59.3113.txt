evident correlation semantic distance creativity treatment metaphor 
tenor vehicle concepts metaphor semantic neighbors local structure taxonomy constrain interpretations significantly curtail breadth search space 
reliance taxonomy wordnet ideally suited treatment local metaphors 
distance involved creative metaphors means tenor vehicle rarely belong semantic category interpretation involve simple recognition common taxonomic parent 
creative metaphor effectively involves interpretation exploit internal relational structure tenor vehicle 
describe certain key elements qualia structure concept pertaining agentive telic properties automatically extracted sense glosses wordnet 
conventional wisdom suggests strong correlation creativity figurative comparisons metaphor conceptual semantic distance involved comparison 
suggestion goes greater conceptual distance concept described target tenor concept carrying description source vehicle greater mental leap performed metaphor greater mental agility demanded listener 
creative metaphors high wire circus acts figurative speech impressive performed safety net 
mundane kind metaphor kind scarcely wanders outside category tenor find vehicle tension evoked creative metaphor caused primarily disparate nature concepts combined real danger combination may misunderstood rejected altogether meaningless 
appreciate figurative creativity contrast term local metaphor distant metaphor 
local metaphors involve tenor vehicle combinations belong superordinate category surgeons cars computers structure superordinate tease small set essential differences see 
contrast distant metaphors involve altogether ambitious kind require interpreter recognize established taxonomic commonalities categories useful latent similarities allow tenor meaningfully terms vehicle 
local metaphors challenge established taxonomic ordering distant metaphors suggest new ways seeing existing concepts terms behave stored 
shall see kinds metaphor creative transcends existing order imposed central taxonomy 
interested understanding behaviors affordances lexical concepts adopt generative view lexical structure pustejovsky 
argue generative lexicon expect find precisely kind relational structure needed interpret local metaphors passport travel diary travel documents distant metaphors protein magician cell 
practical reasons exploration creative metaphor conducted context wordnet comprehensive lexical knowledge base english 
structure wordnet explicit relationships needed construct generative lexicon obviously formal taxonomic constitutive aspects word meaning 
truly test computational model metaphoric interpretation large scale necessary augment relationships telic agentive components encoded directly merely alluded textual glosses associated sense entry 
sections follow describe mechanism automating extraction relationships wordnet glosses vein demonstrate extracted structures mapped projected generate appropriate interpretations creative metaphors 
qualia extraction wordnet glosses generative lexicon core elements word meaning represented nexus relations called qualia structure ties formal hierarchical relations constitutive telic functional agentive construction creation aspects word 
instance diary formally kind book constitutes collection personal writings telic purpose record observations agent compiles 
word diary metaphorically relational nexus provides structure determining internal systematicity interpretation 
instance apt describe passport kind travel diary kinds book formal record telic travel experiences 
describe approach qualia extraction wordnet glosses balances coverage quality attempting extract relatively narrow slice relational structure inherent wordnet glosses confident quite high levels competence 
narrow slice yields significant amount qualia structure wordnet encodes formal constitutive relations taxonomic links synsets 
concentrate efforts extraction telic goal oriented agentive activity oriented lexical relations 
exploit fact agentive telic aspects lexico conceptual structure expressed nominalized verbs implicitly encode relational structure 
small number highly productive morphology rules connect observe observer observation vice versa specialize specializer specialization 
example wordnet concepts defined glosses explicitly employ term specializing evoking concept specializer hyponym expert specializer compatible concepts virtue hyponym person turn suggests seen hyponyms specializer making specializer appropriate telic relation 
combination derivational morphology simple taxonomic reasoning relational structure specializer specialization associated concept 
structure encoded wordnet provides additional dimension similarity metaphoric mapping 
broad clues syntactic form gloss passive voice valuable source extraction information especially robustly inferred simple combination keyword analysis inflectional morphology 
example passive voice cause extracted relation inverted case wordnet gloss person 
resulting relational structure approach requires wordnet taxonomy act vital sanity check extracted relationship 
general sensible associate relation concept nominalization denotes concept belongs taxonomic category sensible ascribe specializer relation specializer specify sub category person 
broad finds important exception metonymic contexts 
consider wordnet gloss diary journal daily record usually private experiences observations yields extracted relationships experience experience recorder recording observer observation 
taxonomic sanity check reveals diary journal sub category communication compatible recorder observer sub categories person 
taxonomically compatible objects relations recording observation suggests diary object observer recorder 
metonymy evident familiar address dear diary diary conceived counterpart observer 
concept diary journal yields modified relational structure diary journal observer observation recorder recording experience experience signals observer recorder relations hold literally 
presence relationships facilitate creative uses concept diary follow general pattern artifacts viewed intentional stance 
example consider wordnet gloss concept witness spectator close observer relational structure extracted witness spectator observer observation apt metaphorically consider diary witness life experiences 
structure mapping terms reflected internal systematicity finding key relationship observer observation common diary witness spectator 
local metaphor local metaphors source target concept united common taxonomic parent 
metaphors local necessity common parent far removed source target interpretation vague meaningful 
common parent conceptually close source target source target conceptual neighbors taxonomy 
advocates taxonomic approach allow common parent carry meaning metaphor see 
butcher meaningful metaphor surgeon professionals cut flesh living 
place burden meaning common parent definition metaphors symmetric nature 
symmetric metaphors exist little semantic tension rise status simple example consider credit unions banks 
contrast creative metaphors asymmetric impose highly developed relational structure source concept developed target 
imposition relational structure metaphor highlight existing similarities create new ones creative function 
notwithstanding perspective local metaphors symmetric lacking creativity 
key seeing local metaphor creative move burden meaning common taxonomic parent structure projected source target 
projection relational structure performed literally 
literal interpretation relational structure source simply instantiated target concept example literal travel diary diary contains travel recordings travel observations 
contrast figurative interpretations attempt retrieve counterpart source target retrieval cue project relational structure source counterpart 
instance wordnet contains variety concepts formally similar diary journal mention travel glosses travel guidebook passport 
facilitate reading travel diary journal passport observer travel observation recorder travel recording experience travel experience projecting relational structure diary journal passport causes seen journal travel observations experiences 
travelers retain old purpose 
metaphors apt projection highlights latent relational structure exists target concept 
example compound pastry surgeon understood taxonomically referring pastry cook surgeon sub category person 
fully appreciate surgeon apt hyponyms person say look shared relational structure highlighted metaphor 
wordnet defines surgeon physician specializes surgery pastry cook glossed chef specializes pastry 
surgeon pastry cook associated relationship specializer 
common relational structure facilitates measurement termed internal systematicity gentner sense 
surgeon seen apt vehicle pastry cook people specialize particular field 
instantiation shared structure leads interpretation pastry surgeon pastry cook specializer pastry surgery choice delve deeper recursively determine appropriate interpretation pastry surgery left comprehender may choose read metaphor simple request view pastry specialists 
raises question structure shared interpretation appear apt merely 
example equally say pastry linguist pastry highlight specialist nature pastry linguist associated extracted specializer relationship 
alternate metaphors clumsy difficulty assigning appropriate interpretations recursive metaphors imply pastry implies metaphor pastry geology pastry linguist implies metaphor pastry linguistics 
pastry linguist pastry cook specializer pastry linguistics pastry linguistics non starter wordnet terms pastry surgery potential meaningful interpretation plastic surgery surgery concerned therapeutic cosmetic reformation tissue pastry surgery plastic surgery reformation pastry tissue interpretation requires existing form surgery recruited adapted accommodate concept pastry 
taxonomic terms plastic surgery appropriately adapted purpose tissue pastry hyponyms substance wordnet 
possible recruit established metaphor schema see accommodate interpretation schema lexicalized wordnet 
consider instance metaphor genetic person maps person specializes genetics genetic mapper genetic mapping possible interpret sub metaphor genetic mapping terms existing metaphor wordnet chromosome mapping process locating genes chromosome genetic performs chromosome mapping 
distant metaphor distant metaphors involve juxtaposition source target concepts considerably removed taxonomic scheme things 
pairings common taxonomic superordinate generally vague contribute way structure constraints meaning metaphor 
distant metaphors lack safety net developed common ground meaning determined 
example consider metaphor protein magician cell 
metaphor concepts protein magician lowest common hypernym wordnet entity physical thing 
hypernym unique beginner tens thousands hyponyms little gained concept common ground metaphor 
metaphor understood terms structural relations imposed protein vehicle magician magician performs magic tricks audience performer magic trick entertainment protein magician performer protein magic trick protein entertainment projecting relational structure magician extracted wordnet gloss protein succeed shifting onus interpretation sub metaphors protein magic trick protein entertainment mean 
turn yield analysis local distant metaphor 
consider local analysis taxonomic terms rephrase problem magic trick entertainment types activity wordnet hyponyms activity involve proteins 
find hyponyms need construe activity widest possible sense confine search specific sense entailed entertainment magic trick 
broadening senses kind domain see necessary distant metaphors relational structure concept restructure concept radically different taxonomic tree 
activity sense activity natural process find candidate hyponyms active transport transport substance protein drug cell membrane concentration gradient proteins peptides amino acids cleavage peptide bonds point reach limits wordnet powered analysis matter subjective opinion activities considered magical entertaining 
limited superficial measurements active transport candidate explicitly mentions thematic keyword cell 
paraphrase wordnet interpretation protein magician cell follows facilitating active transport cell protein acts way considered magical entertaining 
conclude empirical observations regarding efficacy extracting qualia structures wordnet glosses 
process described operating entirely combination derivational morphology rules taxonomic sanity checking currently able automatically extract relationships noun glosses wordnet 
furthermore noun glosses contain word denotation extraction set suggests extensions process may able obtain higher coverage relatively minor additions mechanism 
encouraged view events development wordnet soon augmented explicit hand coded morpho semantic connections verbs nominalizations see news developments 
hand coding increase precision extraction process entirely removing dependency generating morphology rules 
wordnet encyclopedia sense say lexical taxonomy useful features encyclopedia 
essential difference advantages disadvantages 
plus side brevity textual definition associated wordnet synset means gloss contains highly relevant information extraction techniques applied larger definitions quality extracted relationships surely lowered dramatically 
negative side means expect extract just concept useful relational content 
properly handle recursive sub metaphors entailed creative metaphors viewing activity protein entertaining magic trick need draw richer source word world knowledge 
may worthwhile consider usefulness large text corpora text content dynamically available world wide web basis interpreting creative metaphors
