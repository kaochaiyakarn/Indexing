appleseed trust metric appleseed trust metric constitutes main contribution novel proposal local group trust metrics 
contrast advogato inspired maximum network flow computation basic intuition appleseed motivated spreading activation strategies 
spreading activation models proposed quillian order simulate human comprehension semantic memory 
commonly described models retrieval long term memory activation subdivides paths emanating activated mental representation 
time writing seminal quillian respect seed node ported plethora disciplines latent semantic indexing text illustration 
example briefly introduce spreading activation approach adopted semantic search contextual network graphs order relate appleseed 

searches contextual network graphs 
graph model underlying search strategies contextual network graphs identical structure section edges connecting nodes edges assigned continuous weights 
source node start search activated injection energy propagated nodes edges set simple rules energy fully divided successor nodes respect normalized local edge weight higher weight edge higher portion energy flows edge 
furthermore supposing average outdegrees greater closer node injection source paths leading higher amount energy flowing general 
eliminate endless marginal negligible flow energy streaming node exceed threshold order run dry 
described approach captured formally algorithm propagates energy recursively 
procedure energize energy energy energize algorithm 
recursive energy propagation 
trust propagation 
algorithm shows basic intuition spreading activation models 
order tailor models trust computation appleseed trust metric serious adaptations necessary 
instance procedure energize registers energy passed node accumulated energy 
energy represents rank higher values indicate higher node rank 
time energy contributing rank passed loss successor nodes 
interpreting energy ranks trust ranks implies numerous issues semantic consistency computability 
consider graph depicted left hand side 
applying spreading activation trust ranks nodes identical 
common sense tells accorded trust shortest path distance trust seed higher 
trust decay commonly agreed people tend trust individuals trusted friends individuals trusted friends friends 
right hand side entails serious implications 
energy trust respectively distributed edge trapped cycle accorded nodes part cycle nodes eventually acquire infinite trust rank 
obviously bottleneck property hold 
similar issues occur simplified versions pagerank cycles accumulating infinite rank dubbed rank sinks :10.1.1.31.1768:10.1.1.31.1768

node chains rank sinks 
spreading factor 
handle issues trust decay node chains elimination rank sinks tailoring algorithm rely global spreading factor denote energy influx node respective parameter denotes portion energy node distributes successors retaining 
instance suppose energy quantity flowing node total energy distributed successor nodes amounts energy rank energy increases 
special treatment necessary nodes zero outdegree

formally suppose energy injection source equation holds computation step modified spreading algorithm incorporating concept spreading factor energy spreading factor may seen ratio direct trust trust ability recommend trustworthy peers 
instance beth maurer explicitly differentiate direct trust edges recommendation edges 
generally assume values may reasonable 
instance having allows agents keep trust granted pass small portions trust accorded peers 
observe low values favor trust proximity source trust injection high values allow trust reach nodes away 
furthermore spreading factor crucial making appleseed retain levien bottleneck property shown sections 

rank normalization 
algorithm edge weight normalization quantity ex energy distributed successor node depends relative weight compared sum weights outgoing edges ex normalization common practice trust metrics pagerank eigentrust :10.1.1.31.1768:10.1.1.31.1768:10.1.1.58.2191:10.1.1.58.2191:10.1.1.11.4846:10.1.1.11.4846
normalized reputation trust reasonable models plain non weighted edges serious interferences occur edges weighted case trust model adopted section 
instance refer left hand side unwanted effects amount energy node accords successors respectively identical value 
note issued trust statement telling trust weak 
hand assigns full trust individuals trust rank higher successor accorded obtain 
trusted times reasonable 

issues trust normalization 
backward trust propagation 
issue discussed solution proposed arguing substantially results achieved despite drawbacks :10.1.1.11.4846:10.1.1.11.4846
propose alleviate problem making backward propagation trust source metric computation takes place additional virtual edges node trust source created 
edges assigned full trust 
existing backward links weights overwritten 
intuitively node supposed blindly trust trust source see 
impacts adding backward propagation links threefold mitigating relative trust 
refer left hand graph 
trust distribution underlying case fairer backward propagation links obtains source accorded 
trust ranks amount times trust assigned avoidance dead ends 
dead ends nodes zero outdegree require special treatment computation scheme 
distinct approaches may adopted 
portion incoming trust supposed passed successor nodes completely discarded contradicts constraint energy leaving system 
second retaining incoming trust keeps trust 
approach sensible encourages users issue trust statements peers 
luckily backward propagation trust nodes implicitly linked trust source dead ends consider 
favoring trust proximity 
backward links trust source favorable nodes close source eventual trust rank increase 
hand nodes away penalized 
overly rewarding nodes close source dispute may pose issues 
fact represents tradeoff pay welcome aspects backward propagation 

nonlinear trust normalization 
addition backward propagation integral part appleseed propose supplementary measures decrease negative impact trust distribution relative weights 
situations nodes poor ratings awarded high trust ranks low outdegree avoided 
squares local trust weights provides appropriate solution ex example refer node 
squared normalization total amount energy flowing backward source increases amount energy flowing poorly trusted node decreases significantly 
accorded trust quantities amount respectively 
serious penalization poor trust ratings achieved selecting powers

appleseed suffers common trust metrics notably finding principal eigenvectors 
hand approach pursued advogato penalize trust relationships asserted eager trust node capacities depend local information 
remember capacities nodes pertaining level assigned capacity level outdegree nodes part level 
advogato encourages agents issuing numerous trust statements appleseed penalizes abundant trust certificates 
deterministic trust computation 
appleseed deterministic respect assignment trust rank agents 
arbitrary trust graph node linear equations allow characterize amount trust assigned quantity accords successor nodes 
advogato non deterministic 
number trusted agents computed maximum flow size determined input parameters set agents 
changing order trust assertions issued may yield different results 
example suppose cv holds trust seed furthermore assume issued trust certificates agents actual choice trustworthy peer maximum flow depends order nodes accessed 
model output type 
basically advogato supports non weighted trust statements 
appleseed versatile trust model weighted trust certificates 
addition advogato returns set trusted peers appleseed assigns ranks agents 
ranks allow select trustworthy agents relate respect accorded rank 
definition thresholds trustworthiness left user tailor relevant parameters fit different application scenarios 
instance raising application dependent threshold selection trustworthy peers may absolute relative value allows enlarging neighborhood trusted peers 
appleseed adaptive flexible advogato

expanding nodes possible highly desirable 
choosing reasonably large instance twice number agents assumed trustworthy may expect relevant nodes mind appleseed proceeds breadth considers close nodes eligible trust distant ones 
upper bounded path lengths

furthermore supposing trust quantity injected assigned trust ranks greater value enlarging gaps neighbors trust rank 

testbed local group trust metrics trust metrics models trust propagation intuitive underpinning need application occam razor
