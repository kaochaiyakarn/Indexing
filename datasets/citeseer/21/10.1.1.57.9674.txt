springer verlag berlin heidelberg specification enforcement access control describes mechanism securely exchanging soap messages 
provides main security features ability send security tokens user name certificates part soap message authenticate users provide message integrity message confidentiality 
security assertion markup language oasis xml framework exchanging authentication authorization information extensible access control markup language xacml oasis lets express authorization access control policies xml 
xacml defines vocabulary specify subjects rights objects conditions 
implementations xacml standard exist example sun xacml implementation written java access control engine software 
knowledge implementation enforces xacml policy application 
approaches mentioned concentrate developing new approaches security web services propose integrate wellestablished security model different domain web service applications 
security model called view access control originates corba applications 
variant role access control provides specification language view policy language vpl access control policies specified 
authorizations specified fine grained level single web service operations authorization rights change dynamically triggered operation calls 
model implemented corba infrastructure accompanied comprehensive set powerful xml management tools 
enforces vpl policy corba systems 
identified features needed describe access control web services extended vpl accordingly applied vpl specification access control requirements web services 
infrastructure enforce web service security policy 
developed proxy intercepts soap messages 
proxy extracts authentication service information delegates access decision infrastructure 
infrastructure decides request rejected web service executed 
advantages integration established security model web services unique access control model access control language house applications web services 
reduces expert security knowledge required system designers administrators 
powerful access control language dynamic right changes expressed authorization explicitly granted denied level web service operations 
example xacml provide possibility dynamic right changes tomcat specifies access control level entire web applications 
vpl especially designed readability easy developers system administrators 
xacml mainly designed describe access fink koch control policies format allows efficient machine evaluation access requests access requirements 
vpl suitable system designers administrators reduces design administration errors 
vpl supports automatic type consistency checks

vpl view defines authorization subset operations single web service referenced controls clause 
example view gives permission call operation web service 
vpl view statically restricted certain roles listed restricted clause assigned roles 
example view assigned role staff customer 
view gives permission operations 
video store register customers see requirements sec operation called subset possible operation parameters 
example get called calling video store video store gets registering video central web service 
analog operation called calling video store 
restriction parameters necessary vpl originating corba applications 
operation granted called possible operation parameters denied
