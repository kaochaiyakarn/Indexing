usually need data processing invalid data cleaning session identification 
data cleaning removes log entries images needed mining process 
order identify unique users sessions heuristic methods mainly ip session time outs 
context considered new session created new ip address encountered visiting page time exceeds time threshold minutes ip address 
original web logs transferred user access session datasets analysis 
process illustrated 
clustering users sessions useful discovering groups users exhibiting similar browsing patterns groups pages having related content url occur 
clustering users sessions important web applications line monitoring user behaviour line performance analysis detecting traffic problems 
clustering web documents helps discover groups pages having related content 
general web document considered collection web pages set related web resources html files xml files images applets multimedia resources

clustering algorithms hierarchical partitional applied order determine classes clusters user session assigned 
hierarchical algorithms define hierarchy clustering merging similar clusters 
hand partitional approaches means define flat clustering pre determined number clusters minimal costs 
originally sessions clustering efforts considered sessions unordered sets clicks number common pages visited similarity indication sessions

model probabilistic clustering approach model clustering techniques widely shown promising results applications involving web data 
specifically modelbased approach users sessions clusters generated follows

design hierarchical indexes indexes calculate efficiently distance metrics required clustering procedure various parts xml documents easily maintained reflect changes statistics 
current examples issues explored include xml retrieval systems xxl xirql hierarchical indexing methodologies flexible indexes dynamic generation vector spaces 
interesting issue arises viewing xml documents data centric approach 
treating elements categorical attributes values red green blue element color categorical attribute values elements market basket data values element price brings data mining perspective task grouping xml documents content 
challenge application data mining techniques example rock algorithm clustering categorical attributes context xml documents requirement granularity 
clustering xml documents structure dimension modeling xml documents tree models face clustering xml documents structure problem tree clustering problem exploit tree edit distances define metrics capture structural similarity 
assuming set tree operations insert delete replace node cost model assign costs tree edit distance trees minimum cost costs possible tree edit sequences transform 
tree edit distance estimate structural similarity trees represent xml documents included clustering procedures identify clusters structurally similar xml documents 
tree edit distance calculations quite intensive vector approaches capture hierarchical relationships tree structures explored basis design appropriate efficient indexes 
main issues consider case structure dimension clustering procedure 
need ordering elements xml documents 
difference importance elements structural primitives hierarchy imposed xml document deletion top element vehicles important deletion bottom element wheel bicycles xml document 

semantic dissimilarities different tags refer semantically similar elements elements price cost 
current examples issues explored include change detection methodologies clustering methodologies indexes time series management bitmaps model tree structures 
web modelling web searching need improved 
emphasis put increasing expressiveness modelling tools web content capturing 
new research directions include developing techniques efficiently cluster entire web similarity searches high dimensional spaces developing scalable robust fuzzy techniques model noisy data sets containing unknown number overlapping categories developing techniques locality sensitive hashing web pages hashed way similar pages higher probability collision dissimilar pages exploring new techniques handle linguistic textual features 
sources new research directions appear considering called deep web 
sources structured stored relational dbmss specified schema 
schemas define object domain source goods movies query capabilities price actor
