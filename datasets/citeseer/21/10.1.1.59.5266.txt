allows presenters manage multiple versions presentation customized situation 
customizable presentations structured nested sub paths organization advantages linear hyperlinked presentations 
pass interface authoring navigating presentations 
key words presentations hypertext powerpoint millions people powerpoint similar tools create deliver presentations 
tools easy speakers organize thoughts linear narratives 
big disadvantage fixed linear structure disregards way talks typically created edited practice 
best planned presentations require clever improvisation current tools events usually dealt rapid fire clicking button skip sections presentation hand waving discussion topics visuals inaccessible 
disrupts flow talk consumes speaker time effort 
furthermore common create multiple versions talk intended different situations audiences say minute conference presentation versus hour colloquium versus minute summary 
today presenters typically create new version making copy slide set editing new situation 
changed copies multiply diverge difficult keep versions coherent edits propagated back forth 
fact speakers append extra slides presentations preparation questions illustrates designed talk paths example audience asks certain question

interface authoring viewing customizable presentations navigating giving talk 
interface designed provide greater degree flexibility speakers adding cognitive load authoring overhead presenter quite arguably concentrate content presentation system displaying 
tools conjunction powerpoint developing system creating richly animated slides 
word caution word processor help produce attractive document quite easy wizards notwithstanding produce unattractive ones similarly interface guarantee user plans appropriate multiple versions talk form sort coherent 
provide environment plans related versions talk maintained conveniently 
customizable presentations just speaker designs presents talk author customizable talk design adaptability designed adaptability presentation 
preparing new talk preparing old talk new audience author customize talk expected audience situation presentation speaker may need adapt talk arise detailed questions shortened presentation times design presentation quite different views presentation reflecting 
views designed desiderata simplest customizable presentation require effort produce linear presentation 
second presenters able add aspects adaptability presentations gradually time prepare give talk new audience 
third simplest case customizable presentation require effort give linear things go exactly expected speaker give presentation software instructions advance slide unexpected occurs system allow speaker seamlessly shift appropriate version presentation enhance contents suit audience 
structuring customizable presentation possible ways structure customizable presentation collection slides 
simplest give speaker random access slides 
presentation time demands ordering talk fly substantial cognitive load distracting speaker decision go slide 
approach ignores logical structure content may suggest natural sequences related slides 
possibility may implemented current technology create hyperlinks slides structuring presentation directed graph 
approach lets speaker build sequencing dependency authoring providing substantial flexibility presentation time 
requires speaker choice branch point presentation complex demands speaker increase 
ideally want structure allows speaker plan order talk organize order alternatives 
authoring tool accomplishes hierarchy predefined paths 
just author structure book chapters sections allow presentations structured nested sections 
section speaker defines section paths logical sequences slides subsections represented paths directed graph 
concatenation nested section paths results presentation path 
hyperlinks multiple paths intersecting slide predetermined way leaving slide long speaker chooses remain path need decision branch points 
speaker wish change paths intersection paths ideal place seamlessly

implementation occupies particular point design space 
allow presenter flexibility control runtime representing versions talk multiple paths single pool 
created short customizable presentations research clearly needed speakers adaptability real life presentation situations 
offer tools test cases methods compared 
ways today computational power help better presentations 
example system devised aid speaker choosing paths fit time presentation automatically adapt time remaining avoid going 
speaker navigation view allows ways improving presentation experience 
example time presentation system compile estimate long speaker spends slide 
allow system provide prediction long alternative path may take 
speaker may choose limit displayed paths fit allotted time 
streamlining navigation view allowing speaker collapse irrelevant sections leave space extensive notes large slide preview animation controls interactive slides
