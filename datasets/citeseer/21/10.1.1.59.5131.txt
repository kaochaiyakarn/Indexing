comparison extent neighboring segments contain stems 
high degree overlap neighboring segments different topics little similarity probably placed different segments 
methods segment analysis text relatively robust words topic boundaries 
decided proceed approach specific segmentation algorithm segmenter 
kehagias report performance greatly segmenter relied training data claimed achieved highest performance segmenter reported literature 
performance test corpus kehagias terms beeferman pk metric compared algorithm 
lower beeferman scores indicate higher performance 
little justification system requires training comparable results achieved need training data 
problem employing requires input segments place topic boundaries segments 
case written material generally unproblematic sentence paragraph normally single topic 
problematic case audio video material transcripts produced asr expected reliably mark sentence boundaries 
problem avoided simply making input segments sequences words silences marked asr transcripts 
short input segments segments words long grouped segment 
calculates similarity input segments cosine measure see example jurafsky martin 
measure gives high scores segments contain mainly words words occur similar frequencies lower scores documents contain different words words occur different frequencies 
absolute values measure reliable assessing similarity short segments looks ranking cosine scores similarities pair segments part input text 
initially input segments grouped big super segment segmentation proceeds breaking initial segment successively smaller super segments 
time divided attempt divide break dissimilar neighboring segments contains 
decide optimal segmentation achieved need specify topical segments created 
bbc news programs fails create separate topical segments short stories covered sentences 
headlines create problem break topical segments fairly arbitrary manner usually resulting stories appearing topical segment
