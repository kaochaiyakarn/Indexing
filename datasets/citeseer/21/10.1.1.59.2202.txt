improving text collection selection coverage overlap statistics thomas hernandez arizona state university dept computer science engineering tempe az th asu edu environment distributed text collections step information retrieval process identify available collections relevant query accessed answer query 
address challenge collection selection full partial overlap available text collections scenario examined previously despite real world applications 
collection selection approach uses collection specific coverage overlap statistics 
describe experimental results show approach displays desired behavior retrieving new results early collection order performs consistently significantly better cori previously considered best collection selection systems

emergence meta search engines news meta searchers bibliography search engines apparent challenge retrieving relevant documents group collections involves just searching information source hand ranking results 
effective system choose collection subset collections call answer query 
particular process generally referred collection selection 
especially important redundant irrelevant calls expensive terms query execution cost post query processing duplicate removal results merging network load source load naturally number collections increase effective collection selection essential performance retrieval system 
general trend existing approaches collection selection evaluate goodness collection type information term document collection frequencies

kambhampati arizona state university dept computer science engineering tempe az rao asu edu proaches require term frequency statistics collection order select sources deem relevant query 
general strategy works fairly collections overlap 
approaches fail take account overlap collections determining collection order may decide call collection new documents considering documents retrieved moment 
take example case mirror collections 
deemed highly relevant highly relevant collections called calling second provide new results 
evidently collection selection approach prevent unnecessary collection accesses useful probably complementary existing approaches 
motivation design system able order collections collection accessed collection provide new results 
system capable making types predictions collection relevant documents collection useful ones selected 
presents collection selection approach called uses information coverage individual collections predict point information overlap collections predict second point 
easy see coverage overlap information regarding collections help collection selection open issue efficiently gather information 

approach essentially composed offline component gathers statistics collections online component uses statistics runtime determine collection ranking new incoming query 
offline component offline component obtain appropriate coverage overlap information collections set training queries 
overlap text collections means documents highly similar opposed strictly identical 
complexity computation mainly affected observations 
collection overlap non symmetric single result collection highly similar stands collection selection coverage overlap statistics results 
second document overlap transitive document overlap document document highly similar 
address inherent challenges compute overlap collections particular keyword query follows collection documents returned query put single bag keywords 
similarity keyword bags approximate overlap collections particular query 
furthermore compute pairwise overlaps collections 
addition overlap statistics offline component retrieves coverage statistics simply refers number documents collection returns specific query 
coverage overlap statistics collected list past queries 
offline component identifies frequent item sets previously asked queries 
computes new statistics corresponding item set averaging statistics query contains item set 
justification frequent item set computation storing statistics respect item sets effectively map runtime new queries set item sets store statistics approximate statistics new query 
online component online component encompasses phases 
incoming query mapped set item sets system statistics 
mapping accomplished determining group item sets covers query 
second coverage overlap statistics query computed averaging statistics mapped item sets 
estimated query statistics system determines collections call order 
collection selected simply highest estimated coverage 
collections selected determining lead largest remaining result set document account estimated overlap collections 
formally step select collection cl argmax ci argmax cj ci cj bag corresponding union result documents query collection ci set selected collections

collection test bed composed real online collections acm digital library acm guide compendex citeseer cs bibliography synthetic collections cumulative number new results oracular cori coverage collection rank performance oracular cori variation approach collection test bed 
created intent having relatively large test bed controlled degree overlap collections 
setup documents essentially publications containing title author names list queries consisted distinct real user queries gathered mediator 
offline component query list probe collection identify frequent item sets training query list gather coverage overlap statistics online component 
remaining query list test collection selection approaches 
kept track cumulative number new results retrieved terms number collections called order analyze degree approach able retrieve results collections called 
displays cumulative plots different approaches illustrates usually retrieved results cori number collection calls 
experimental results 

probably interesting direction follows fact approach relevance results collection guide final collection ranks 
interesting extension attempts design collection selection system take account content relevance documents collections overlap collections 
essentially considers complementary strategy proposed literature preliminary subject point promising system
