basic scheme section presents basic scheme incentive mechanism assumptions listed section 
basic scheme consists components neighbor monitoring reputation propagation punishment described follows 
neighbor monitoring scheme neighbor monitoring collect information packet forwarding behavior neighbors 
due promiscuous mode assume node capable overhearing transmissions neighbors 
capability mobile node maintain neighbor node list denoted contains neighbor nodes node learns overhearing 
addition node keeps track numbers neighbor denoted 
rfn request forwarding total number packets node transmitted forwarding

way hash chain identification authentication address problems natural solution identification authentication identification authentication behaving nodes identified rewarded misbehaving nodes identified punished 
design effective identification authentication scheme needs consider unique property ad hoc networks different wired networks wireless cellular networks

due feature design identification authentication rely infrastructure help communication management mobile nodes 
note design principle different assuming existence authentication infrastructure public key infrastructure pki friendship infrastructure 
design principle propose authentication mechanism way hash chain 
node gets identity denoted idn random number rn recursively applying pseudo random function rn times idn hk rn recursively obtained hi rn hi rn rn joining ad hoc network broadcasts identity idn neighbors receive identity put identity

secure dynamic routing protocol mitigate problem enhance dsr routing protocol security measure 
briefly describe dsr protocol 
dsr demand source routing protocol 
key component dsr route discovery protocol invoked source node node know path node destination works 
node initiates route request packet rreq broadcasts neighbors 
neighbors turn append address packet rreq broadcast 
process continues packet rreq reaches destination packet rreq contains complete path node node reaches node node send route request reply packet rrep containing path information back node reverse path 
node receives packet rrep path node node contained packet rrep confirmed 
packets node forwarded identified path 
start discussion vulnerabilities basic scheme section 
worried selfish node may cooperative forwarding route request packets doing damage reputation 
concern selfish node may play tricks forwarding route request rreq route request reply rrep 
example selfish node may provide source node fake path include selfish node looks shorter valid path includes selfish node 
usually shortest path picked shorter path containing selfish node selected selfish node avoids responsibility forwarding data packets cheating detected 
kind misbehavior severely degrade performance network packets transmitted invalid path reach destination 
fake path including selfish node may take actions 
case node neighbor source node participates normal procedure route discovery protocol assume route request reply rrep conveys valid path record containing node 
node fake route request reply rrep containing arbitrary path length shorter discovered path containing node denote fake path nl destination neighbor node nl selfish node asked forward packets node node case node neighbor source node participates normal procedure route discovery protocol 
receiving route request rreq including route record say nj casts packets denoted rreq rreq hop rreq contains node route record rreq 
destination return route request reply messages rrep rrep rrep contains route record nj nj nj nl number hops route rrep contains nj nj nl 
receiving rrep rrep rrep rrep node nj 
assume node nj check node neighbor node nj broadcast rrep node receive rrep node path specified rrep fake shorter path include node selfish node asked forward packets node node alternatively node may fake invalid path length valid replacing id spoofed id doing may path nj nj nl 
probability valid path containing node selected reduced 
address case enhancing dsr protocol source destination authentication scheme 
key assumption scheme source destination verify authenticity messages communications 
assumption reasonable communication implies existence association secret key shared association 
accordingly communication partners secret key compute macs order authenticate messages communications 
fact feasibility assumption usually basis secure routing protocols 
source destination authentication scheme 
receiving route request rreq destination computes message authentication code denoted forthe message nl seq macs nl discovered path seq query sequence number macs mac seq generated source query sequence number seq query identification allows discard replayed queries 
destination appends reply packet rrep nl seq macs sends rrep reverse direction discovered path 
route reply rrep accepted contained valid 
mac computationally infeasible forged secret key shared difficult selfish node source accept fake path 
address case borrow idea originated associativity routing abr 
abr protocol node periodically transmits beacons indicating existence neighbors receives beacons neighbors 
node maintains table entry registers number beacons node heard neighbors different entry table corresponds different neighbor 
numbers abr measure node connectivity relationship associativity neighbors 
abr associativity measure select reliable path 
different abr utilize associativity measure identify inactive neighbors faked selfish nodes 
neighbor node regarded active node periodically receives beacons node node regarded inactive 
transmission collision shared channel guarantee node receives transmitted beacon neighbors 
practical way deciding active node marks neighbor active number successfully received beacons node certain time period exceeds pre determined threshold 
assuming time slotted system section tag active inactive way hash chain authentication scheme described section propose enhanced route discovery protocol dsr 

source node initiates route discovery protocol constructing broadcasting route request packet rreq seq macs seq query sequence number macs mac message seq computed key shared 
th intermediate node path receives request rreq th interval node works 
identity node contained route record rreq discard request 
node forwarded rreq active neighbor discard request 
route record rreq contains active neighbor discard request 
described rreq incorrect discard request 
node removes rreq append identity route record compute message authentication code nj nj seq macs key th interval broadcast request rreq nj nj seq macs ki key disclosure delay ki key th interval 

request rreq reaches destination works 
seq rreq new discard request 
node forwarded rreq active neighbor discard request 
route record rreq contains active neighbor discard request 
mac rreq incorrect discard request 
node constructs route request reply rrep nl seq macs mac message nl seq macs 
node sends rrep source reverse direction discovered path 

rrep reaches node nodes operates 
rrep incorrect discard rrep 
accept path rrep valid path pick shortest path valid paths send data packets 
help source node find optimal path 
step optional 
authenticate may need wait key disclosure upstream node nj 
reduce delay immediate authentication achieved method 
secure routing protocol selfish node play tricks source node pick fake shorter path 
possible trick node periodically broadcasts beacons behalf neighbor say node neighbor node hops away node sending fake beacons may cost energy resource forwarding packets 
scheme beaconing required may incur quite bit overhead abr type routing protocol beaconing readily available pay extra cost 
reduce energy consumed beaconing increase beaconing interval node need send beacons communicated certain time period node marks neighbor active node learns certain amount communication node time period
