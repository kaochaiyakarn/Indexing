straightforward way attempt enforce cooperation mechanism user amount resources user long continues donate similar amount resources 
willing extend certain amount credit point paying back 
simple mechanisms limited 
direct interaction may occur infrequently giving little chance resources donated second unclear happens say leaves system having chance pay back solution type strongly biases users interacting parties direct previous positive experience 
intuitively appealing potentially limits utility system users tend trade repeatedly partners explore new partners 
note difficult new users fully integrated system

useful insofar models worst case behavior system clearly gives adversary control 
realistic model players paired random time period 
furthermore model assume player interacts exactly time period correspond synchronous network 
coalitions sybil attacks 
simplifying assumption adversary acts coalitions act single player adversary powerful simulate actions multiple users 
general view assumptions realistic agree simplify analysis 
case easy modify model appropriate way limiting adversary single play query time period model class adversarial behavior 
equally easy modify model bound maximum coalition size enforced 
preliminary results briefly sketch preliminary results design robust trust inference protocols
