structured messages middleware combined complexity biology autonomous nature bioinformatics integration different data resources extremely difficult 
key data types bioinformatics standard representation standard representations different formats representing dna sequences formal specification simple bit code dna sequence essence simplest biological data types data types considerably complex 
standards exist arisen result years collaborative 
service providers service consumers high degree buy formalisms exist

paolucci note complex types wsdl specification accessing amazon com totally arbitrary 
problem taken extreme bioinformatics complex types simply 
demonstrate point gathered bioinformatics service descriptions defined complex types simple list type 
just structuring data xml schema provides little value 
projects accepted data receive structured standard way 
obvious corollary restructuring information largely opaque service layer 
projects coped different ways 
simplest approach grid 
service providers largely autonomous change data formats compelling reasons 
grid imposes additional structuring data 
problems stemming lack formal representation formats bioinformatics long time solve problems tools parsers capable coping multitude formats 
grid project existence formats described enables www mrc ac uk software themes html swissprot database instance pages human readable specification format 
alternatively regexp grammar designed parse database lines long fully parse implicit structure www ebi ac uk mygrid webservices discover services translate formats formats opaque middleware 
process previously described automatic semantic translation 
adopted terminology shim services addition format translation situations users supported composing services discover 
firstly identifier dereferencing bioinformatics extensive identifiers substituting identifier data describes common task secondly decomposition selecting subset data produced service 
cases appears services automatically composed safe manner change intended meaning experimental design enable 
moby services semantic moby provide additional structuring messaging format 
moby services uses specialised xml schema defines messages acts thin envelope opaque structuring legacy formats 
having accepted existence wrapper moby services migration path increasing structuring data 
currently facility introduce cross characteristic features bioinformatics data addition links related data encoded mainly hyperlinks databases 
cross provide similar facility programmatically accessed services 
semantic moby hand uses owl dl rdf xml messaging layer owl dl content structuring 
ontological concepts mapped xsd data types providers description resource 
rich expressivity owl means time concept descriptions customized extending domain ontologies new properties combining ontologies constraining usage owl dl property restrictions 
short projects assume providers automatically restructure data formats defined xml schemas provide migration paths methodologies reduce problem syntactic heterogeneity 
service provision service interfaces key sociological problem interoperability middleware faces attempting gain support service providers 
semi autonomous tending respond requests service consumers 
happen system usable usable system requires existence services 
moby services project taken different approach 
assumes service providers support moby services specific service interfaces easy generate require minimal changes way shim small piece material fill gaps ensure tight fit level surface service providers 
realm bioinformatics existing services look somewhat command line application 
input output 
usually set parameters values modify way service works command line options 
describe style interface table document style 
moby services uses subset full web services functionality limiting service interfaces basic data model 
service atomic stateless unrelated services 
grid project assumes various service providers develop web service interfaces purposes middleware solutions just able cope 
additionally developed set services package called 
interestingly available services conform paradigms 
services operations conform simplified model moby services inputs outputs parameters 
service providers group related independent operations single service moby services services single operation 
second paradigm described table object style service operations define ad hoc object model 
creates problem terms invocation 
client uses services understand semantics operations 
grid project enabled extensible invocation framework workflow enactment engine 
approach falls short generic solution framework needs extended different styles web services 
constrained domain bioinformatics relatively service providers sufficient 
document style sequence gap object style void sequence void gap 
invoke table 
different service interfaces blast widely bioinformatics tool 
blast operates biological sequence number parameters returns single complex blast report 
document style interface single method complex set parameters object style interface uses object identifiers provide ad hoc object orientation 
semantic moby service interface somewhat different 
rest architecture service interface example 
underlying messages provide richer interface defined semantic argued web services designed support object style interfaces 
may true grid aims services autonomous providers needs cope 
moby upper ontology 
moby services service interface atomic stateless unrelated services 
compared general wsdl services simplified approach projects taken service interfaces important consequences 
owl defines grounding ontology describes relationships ontological concepts underlying invocation description wsdl 
required projects semantic moby service interface defined upper ontology moby services service interfaces heterogeneous grid enactment engine deals small amount heterogeneity 
services atomic decomposable 
result similar owl process ontology 
grid uses services require complex interaction services interaction handled enactment engine 
user centred service descriptions semantic web services architecture requires set semantic service descriptions matchmaker service discover services 
projects seeking enable discovery services user 
projects share similar ideas questions users wish ask 
context user specific piece data wishes know services operate type data 
outcome user wishes get specific type data wishes know services produce kind data 
task user knows kind task alignment retrieval search perform wishes known 
grid project introduced number properties services including called uses resource 
bioinformatics tools operate different data sources 
underlying data critical impact service may affect interface presents 
user centred approach users concepts services necessarily confirm underlying middleware 
example grid services generally collection independent related operations 
object style interfaces described section user wishes find service individual operations essentially implementation detail 
moby services abstraction directly represented middleware service operation 
second example distinction inputs parameters distinction understood analogy command line main argument set options switches 
general users interested searching inputs primary secondary inputs moby services parlance parameters safely ignored invocation time 
serving users needs distinction serendipitous effect greatly reducing space technology search 
biggest limitation service descriptions moment assumption single class user 
example grid ontology aimed main user base 
previous systems tambis aimed biologists biological concepts protein modelled bioinformatics concepts swissprot id 
projects somewhat differing ideas provide service descriptions 
moby services semantic moby systems service providers describe services 
conversely approach service provision grid project concluded service providers may may choose short term descriptions third party members grid project 
essential may desirable long term 
service descriptions currently manually generated projects 
relatively simple familiar formalism moby services see section ensures process relatively straightforward 
alternatively semantic moby grid relying provision tool support ease process 
grid project effort area reusing tool pedro project presents user fill form generates services descriptions 
describing services arduous process simplified service interfaces reduce required complexity service descriptions section 
addition legacy formats section means little information mined wsdl files tools wsdl daml relatively ineffective information 
information gained reading associated documentation guesswork service operation names experimental execution services followed manual inspection results clear approaches scalable 
possible automated techniques may applicable 
restricted domain bioinformatics possible partially automate experimental service execution 
short term authoring service descriptions remain major bottleneck 
generating ontology complex domain fundamental difficulty semantic web services architectures requirement domain ontology 
ontology reflect users understanding domain enable description services service providers pedro man ac uk difficult services demonstrates clearly better service descriptions genuinely needed 
helpful third parties particularly support user oriented service discovery 
complex changing domain bioinformatics small undertaking 
fortunately bioinformatics community conversant generally convinced value ontological descriptions 
years community developed gene ontology go 
hierarchically organised controlled vocabulary 
ontology structurally simple having subsumption part hierarchies 
ontology widely consists terms describe database entries
