web data extraction integration objectives approaches unstructured web today contains millions documents query able database heavily mix layout structure 
annotated 
huge gap web information qualified structured data usually required corporate information systems envisioned semantic web 
vision semantic web realized faster achievement goal absolutely necessary semi automatically extract relevant data html document automatically translate data structured format xml 
transformed data applications stored databases populate ontologies 
program automatically extracts data transforms format markups content semantic information usually referred wrapper 
wrappers bridge gap unstructured information web structured databases
