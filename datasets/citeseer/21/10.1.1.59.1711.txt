snaket draws snippets search engines enriches querying anchor text kb 
enriched snippets subsequently filtered list stemmed segmented phrases analyzed extracting part speeches named entities 
process called snippet analyzer fig 

snaket generates gapped sentences labeling folders incremental approach see module sentence generator fig 

initially snaket extracts enriched snippets pairs words occur fixed proximity window 
pairs ranked dmoz engine boosting factors depend pos ne 
low ranked word pairs discarded 
remaining pairs incrementally merged form longer gapped sentences 
suffix trees suffix arrays word pairs merging gapped sentences words may occur contiguously snippets 
approach combination inverted lists bitmaps built fast fly snippets 
data structures allow efficiently incrementally merge gapped sentence word pair wh wk appear snippet proximity window 
resulting longer gapped sentence preserves original order wh wk appear source snippet 
rank sentence function ranks constituting pairs adjacent words computed dmoz ranking engine 
low ranked sentences discarded process repeated merge possible sentences formed words number customizable 
sentences discarded process provide candidate labels annotation leaves folder hierarchy 
notice cost merging process negligible respect operations linear size inverted lists 
hierarchical clustering snaket uses innovative bottom hierarchical clustering algorithm aim construct folder hierarchy compact terms total number folders balanced terms descending folders overlapping snippet cover multiple themes 
snaket aims assigning folder labels accurate respect snippets themes distinct avoid overwhelming repetition words intelligible means variable length sentences 
process called hierarchy builder fig 

initially snippets grouped folders candidate gapped sentences share 
folders provide leaves hierarchy labels provide annotations called primary labels 
postulating snippets sharing gapped sentence deal theme clustered folder 
order leaf folders hierarchy construction snaket enriches folder set secondary labels defined gapped sentences occur snippets currently 
primary label provides finer description secondary labels provide coarser description folder snippets 
manage primary secondary labels efficiently concatenate unique string special character separator 
string called signature folder denoted sig 
inductive step bottom hierarchy construction process consists main phases parent formation ranking pruning 
parent folder created group 
cj folders share gapped sentence signatures primary secondary labels deployed

snaket builds weighted bipartite graph sets vertices parent folders currently construction children folders edges denote parent child relationship weight vertex rank corresponding folder 
graph exploited pruning phase goal clean current level folder hierarchy order match goals stated section 
snaket adopts different pruning rules discard currently formed parent folders 
rule aims discarding parent folders redundant wrt graph covering relation parent folders cover children folders snaket keeps parent folder having largest rank 
second rule aims discarding parent folders redundant wrt syntactic similarity relation labels parent folders annotated labeling words snaket keeps parent folder having largest rank 
rule takes account label conciseness accuracy distinctiveness 
rules applied weighted bipartite graph greedy approach details full 
number discarded folders negligible deletion contributes hierarchy intelligible compact 
note graph covering rule similar proposed additionally gapped sentences labels apply syntactic similarity relation obtain better folder labels see fig 

pruning remaining parent folders provide level bottom process repeated 
process currently stopped levels built deeper hierarchy user friendly
