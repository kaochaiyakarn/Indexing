prot owl plugin prot driven biomedical applications 
prot started specialized tool specific kind problem solving evolved generic flexible platform types knowledge applications tools kinds domains 
prot characterized ontology development environment 
provides functionality editing classes slots properties instances 
strengths automatically generate user interface class definitions support rapid knowledge acquisition 
prot supports database storage scalable concepts provides multi user support synchronous knowledge entry 
current version prot highly extensible customizable 
core frame knowledge model support metaclasses 
metaclasses extended define languages top core frame model 
languages prot extended backends alternative file formats 
currently back ends clips uml xml rdf daml oil owl available download 
prot allows developers extend internal model representation customize user interface freely 
illustrated prot user interface consists screens called tabs display different aspects ontology different views 
tabs filled arbitrary components 
existing tabs provide tree browser view model tree left details selected node right hand side 
details selected object typically displayed means forms 
forms consist configurable components called widgets 
typically widget displays property selected object 
standard widgets common property types ontology developers free replace default widgets specialized components

building owl ontologies prot owl ontology regarded network classes properties individuals 
classes define names relevant domain concepts logical characteristics 
properties called slots attributes roles define relationships classes allow assign primitive values instances 
individuals instances classes specific values properties 
semantic web regarded network ontologies web resources 
owl ontology concepts concepts ontologies 
basic mechanism capability ontology import ontology import resources existing ontologies create instances specializations classes 
biomedical example ontology class defined kind measured average depth 
individuals ontology describe specific case data specific left central sulcus individual value mm depth 
example ontology import existing ontology units reuse concepts class editor prot owl plugin 
files support knowledge sharing 
take look elements defined prot 
classes important view prot owl plugin tab 
tab displays tree ontology classes left selected class shown form center 
upper region class form allows users edit class metadata name comments labels multiple languages 
widget upper right area form allows users assign values annotation properties class 
annotation properties hold arbitrary values author creation date 
ontologies define annotation properties reuse existing ones dublin core ontology 
contrast properties annotation properties formal meaning external owl components reasoners extremely important vehicle maintaining information 
typical case annotation properties biomedical field assign standardized identifiers icd codes concepts describe disease 
annotation properties predefined rdfs seealso define cross concepts 
owl plugin uses annotation properties store prot specific information manage lists ontology authors 
properties properties widget tab allows users view create relationships classes 
provides access properties instances current class 
characteristics property edited form shown 
form provides metadata area upper part displaying property name annotations similar presentation class form 
owl property form prot 
available choices range drop box depend property datatype property primitive values object property classes 
datatype properties prot supports enumerations symbols owl oneof reasonable xml schema datatypes grouped booleans floats integers string types 
example datatype property take floats values 
object properties store individuals classes ontology 
example object property take instances values 
depending property object datatype property prot provides widgets property characteristics property symmetric transitive 
symmetric properties describe bidirectional relationships related property rs related 
example contiguity relationship symmetric 
property rt transitive related rt related rt related rt 
part relationships usually considered transitive 
domain widget restrict property domain list classes property 
domain restrictions optional left blank owl ontologies may slow reasoning processes 
property domain restriction instances class 
specialization owl theoretical foundation description logic 
description logic class set individuals 
concept corresponding set individuals usually called top thing 
set individuals subset set individuals bis said subclass ofa bis said kind ofa 
classes subconcepts 
words superclasses define necessary conditions class membership 
conversely subclasses define sufficient conditions class membership 
example frontal lobe necessary condition left frontal lobe order instance individual instance certainly fulfill requirements 
conversely left frontal lobe sufficient condition frontal lobe instance instance may instances instances 
really important keep mind subconcept subset individuals 
common mistake mix specialization composition hierarchies 
subconcept erroneous lobe lung kind lung part lung 
correct subconcepts lung 
specialization principle implies inheritance properties 
instance say sulcus subclass 
subclasses specific superclasses range subclass may subclass range superclass 
called property restriction 
example say sulcus side class side subclass sulcus side subclass 
prot tree widget tab organized subclass hierarchy 
see thing represents root tree 
prot users browse view edit classes tree create new subclasses move classes easily drag drop 
direct superclasses listed conditions widget described 
owl plugin allows navigate edit ontologies relationships classes particular visualize part relationships common biomedical domains 
logical class characteristics conditions widget tab allows fully take advantage owl description logic support express conditions classes property restrictions expressions 
syntax owl expressions prot summarized table 
key point understand expression involving property range property concept property concept represents set individuals interpreted concept 
example lobe set individuals related instance relationship related instances concepts 
conversely lobe set individuals exclusively related instances relationship related relationship 
similarly union intersection sets sets interpreted classes 
example gyrus represents set left anatomical parts time gyri represents set individuals instances concept 
operator define class individual class 
instance set individuals instance 
owl allows define class exhaustively enumerating instances 
logical symbols prot owl plugin widely description logic community 
major advantage allow display complex class expressions relatively compact form 
shown prot provides convenient expression editor support mouse keyboard editing 
domain experts especially non technical domains biomedicine may require training get symbols 
users prot provides english prose explanations owl expression mouse moved 
collaborators working alternative editors support template editing metaphor 
prot generic form architecture allows quickly assemble alternative editors environment 
prot provides comfortable editor arbitrary owl expressions 
formal definitions owl primitives exploited reasoners 
compute specialization relationships inheritance classes logical definitions 
reasoning support shown valuable feature ontology design particularly biomedical domains 
ontology designers periodically invoke reasoner see logical class definitions meet expectations sure inconsistency arise 
necessary conditions 
mentioned necessary condition individual instance class instance superclasses class 
addition saying class subclass superclasses subclass lobe necessary conditions allow specify properties class fulfill 
important activity building ontology don want limit saying frontal lobe kind lobe want represent specific frontal lobe opposed lobes 
example frontal lobe delimited central sulcus lateral sulcus 
original condition lobe add necessary conditions 
conditions hold concepts individual fails fulfill conditions instance 
necessary sufficient conditions 
necessary conditions interpreted subset superset relationships sets individuals 
similarly may want represent classes exactly instances mutual subclasses 
example left right frontal lobe kinds frontal lobe owl element symbol key example expression prot owl allvaluesfrom owl somevaluesfrom owl hasvalue yellow owl mincardinality value owl maxcardinality values owl cardinality exactly value owl intersectionof gyrus owl unionof owl owl oneof 
table prot uses traditional description logic symbols display owl expressions 
property names appear italics 
common naming convention uppercase names lobe represent classes individuals written lower case 
condition 
want say frontal lobe left right frontal lobe 
necessary sufficient condition basically says frontal lobe left right left right frontal lobe frontal lobe 
classes necessary sufficient conditions called defined classes represented orange icons prot classes necessary conditions called primitive yellow icons 
conditions widget allows edit type conditions copy move expressions blocks 
open world assumption 
description logic called open world assumption said denotes lack knowledge contexts databases said assumed false 
direct consequence don say explicitly classes disjoint perfectly valid individuals common 
widget lower right corner tab allows users represent axioms control aspect 
classification consistency checking major strengths description logic languages owl support intelligent reasoning 
context reasoning means infer new knowledge statements asserted ontology designer 
reasoners tools take ontology perform reasoning 
owl plugin interact reasoner supports standard dig interface racer 
reason ers separate tools discuss details focus application oriented utility 
ontology design interesting reasoning capabilities tools classification consistency checking 
classification 
classification infer specialization relationships classes formal definitions 
basically classifier takes class hierarchy including logical expressions returns new class hierarchy logically equivalent input hierarchy 
illustrated prot display classification results graphically 
user clicked classify button system displays asserted inferred hierarchies highlights differences 
example defined frontal lobe located left hemisphere 
appears direct child concepts asserted hierarchy 
similarly defined lobe located left hemisphere lobe 
definition doesn mention concepts don appear related 
classification reasoner infers lobe subclass 
note defined wouldn known reasoner 
reasoning capability associated description logic particular importance allows prot provides access description logic classifiers display asserted inferred class relationships 
user provide intensional definitions classes 
specialization relationships consequences definitions allow constraints inheritance 
reasoning capabilities approach creating ontology extensional 
require explicitly state specialization relationships concepts previous example 
support especially valuable domain biomedicine deeply nested hierarchies multi relationships part anatomy 
owl ontology designers just add new concept describing logical characteristics classifier automatically place correct position 
furthermore report side effects adding new class 
consistency checking 
addition providing automatic classification reasoning capabilities exploited detect logical inconsistencies ontology 
introduce class 
concepts defined disjoint reasoner reports individual instance class 
clearly consistency checks help tremendously construction maintenance large biomedical terminologies 
owl full owl dl important issue reasoning owl reasoners able handle full expressivity owl 
owl specification distinguishes owl full owl dl indicate language elements typically tractable reasoners 
ontologies owl full elements metaclasses classified 
prot allows users edit owl full concepts provides features help convert ontology owl dl classifier 
owl full ontologies state prot support complete owl full syntax 
linking biomedical resources semantic web section demonstrates owl link biomedical resources semantic web 
scenario owl ontologies provide vocabulary describing contents images scientific articles 
order describe biomedical images defined small image ontology basically defines single defines properties image integer provide dimensions image stores image location property link image owl class defined brain cortex ontology 
content concepts intelligent agents search purposes 
prot create new ontology cortex images owl imports cortex ontology images ontology 
new ontology basically contains instances image class uses classes cortex ontology contents values 
concepts imported ontology prot displays prefix cortex 
prot provides excellent support acquisition instances 
illustrated owl plugin functionality available individuals tab 
class ontology prot generates forms appropriate widgets acquire instances class 
individuals tab shows classes instances form selected instance 
default form contain default widgets numeric text field integer properties clickable list object properties 
example prot selected list widget create add remove buttons property 
property system selected simple text field widget optimized displaying images 
fortunately prot provides forms tab customize forms 
forms tab allows users move resize widgets replace widgets suitable ones 
example replaced default text field widget image widget preview image shown uri 
prot open architecture allows users add arbitrary java components widgets catalogue default widgets sufficient 
little bit programming provide widget allows users select image fills values width height automatically 
instances individuals edited exported web server agents find process 
simple search agent crawl multiple image repositories analyze image ontologies owl parsing library jena supplied search concept agent retrieve filter images semantic proximity 
similar approach implement repository scientific articles 
discussion main goal introduce prot owl plugin show provides promising platform biomedical ontology semantic web projects 
owl plugin pioneers components building reasoning description logic ontologies 
researchers jena sourceforge net description logic community managed create deeply studied maps theoretical terrain believe time put languages owl practice reveal strengths weaknesses languages particular domains everyday 
issues handle description logic development large clinical terminologies discussed 
necessary particular training biomedical domain experts rich semantics owl 
advantages owl obvious 
descriptions logic rely defined semantics modeling structure meaning domain possible 
opposed formalisms frames description logic allow users provide intensional definitions concepts 
consequence ontologies compact error prone easier maintain 
precise semantics description logic possible perform automatic reasoning 
intensional definitions concepts exploited classifiers 
adding new class doesn worry anymore putting right place taxonomic hierarchy 
multiple inheritance automatically detected dealt 
classifiers detect logical inconsistencies class definition prevent having instances 
eventually reasoners infer correct relationships combining ontologies related domains extending ontology context specific features 
point favors sharing common semantic reuse various contexts 
expect owl play key role semantic web evolution sharing biomedical knowledge
