goal preliminary metric time efficient computing trust scores unknown users user take limited amount cpu time 
trust metric named ver works walking social network starting input user propagating trust trust edges 
precisely trust metric works steps 
step purpose destroying cycles 
example cycle trusts trusts trusts 
problem created cycles require passing node times adjusting progressively temporary trust score value converges 
trust metric able walk user just doing compute definitive trust value 
way running time linear number nodes 
assume predicting trust scores unknown users point view user firstly orders users shortest path distance user parameter trust propagation horizon trust propagated distances greater value default 
intuition reliability propagated trust decreases new trust hop 
way number nodes trust metric consider reduced means smaller computational time 
point removes trust edge user certain distance users lower equal distance example edge users distance users distance removed social network 
step ends 
social network directed acyclic graph trust flows users flows back cycles 
second step simple graph walk modified social network starting user trust score maximum definition 
computes trust score users distance users distance trust score user distance depends trust scores users distance computed definitive 
predicting trust score user analyzes incoming trust edges 
trust edges coming users predicted trust score greater considered 
users trustworthy trust statements simply ignored 
predicted trust score user average incoming trust edge values weighted trust score user issued trust statement 
intuition opinions users weighted explicit predicted trustworthiness 
trust horizon structure network possible trust metric able reach node predict trust score

plan verify simple efficient trust metric suitable moleskiing community need design complex trust metrics soon start collecting significative amount data users 

boosting trust recommender systems general works sizeable quantity information available 
means require large user base large number annotations provided users 
long new community sites arise potential community users fragmented smaller communities non exchanging information
