design criteria target users coplink experienced users pressing critical information needs 
design coplink connect closely guided user requirements acquired brainstorming sessions system demos structured questionnaires interviews 
main design criteria considered coplink project included platform independence police departments utilize hardware software platform independence critical 
chen decision support systems stability scalability system offer room system growth expansion 
intuitive ease front user interface intuitive easy flexible meet demanding investigative needs officers 
typical law enforcement applications usually legacy systems having dated performance capability 
example tpd rms took answer simple requests min complex queries 
improved response time critical restoring departmental efficiency 
ensure application speed issues data network communication disk access system needed addressed 
meant carefully distributing logic quickly efficiently executed user input error checking done front database access logic achieved pre compiled stored pl sql procedures database 

data organization access critical issue especially designing system deployed multiple agencies acknowledging agencies store incident data exactly way 
important come data organization design flexible applied underlying data set 
database team designed series standardized views fitted typical information search presentation situations 
example data tpd systems related person location vehicle incident information 
set views developed areas interest underlying data sets mapped standard views making system portable law enforcement agencies 
current law enforcement data scattered distributed information sources
