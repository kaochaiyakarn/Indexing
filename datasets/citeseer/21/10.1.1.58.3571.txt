layer assignment 
fairly common approach layering break directed cycles temporarily reversing connections assign nodes layers topological sorting 
reversing minimum number connections nicely corresponds finding layering maximum number upward pointing arcs 
layer graph crossing lines graph subdivision lines layers reordering nodes bend points 
note bend points shown final visualization intuitively appealing idea successfully employed drawing advice network form basis automatically generated status visualizations 
substantive arguments approach support exploratory data analysis 
firstly implicit definition status directed lines imply receiver higher status sender yields partial ordering coordinates impose complete ordering 
secondly minimum cardinality set cycle breaking connections need unique potentially equally valid interpretations suggested 
just consider network consisting directed cycle 
thirdly problem determining set minimum cardinality hard karp computationally intractable 
results heuristic approximation algorithm suffer problem encountered multiple optimal solutions potential multitude contradictory results uncertainty suggested interpretation granted 
illustration consider layered drawing advice network produced standard instance sugiyama framework heuristic layer assignment procedure implemented library algorithms graph drawing 
means resulting visualization readable 
substantively grossly misleading suggested manuel control auditing group 
summary aspects introduce arbitrariness complete ordering actor status layering implies 
interpretation relative status unreliable impossible visualizations maximum number upward pointing arcs notion status supported 
kathy susan donna manuel sharon nancy stuart bob fred charles wynn carol harold misleading layout advice network resulting standard layer assignment procedure assuming formal status indices sound theoretical basis discussion appropriateness interval scale measurement scope index coordinate node subject scaling determine layering 
trivial layer assignment partition nodes sets equal status place set layer vertically ordered respect status index 
status values differ marginally leading close layers cause perceptual problems crossing non crossing 
line segments running horizontally see 
avoid problems status values clustered vertices status values cluster assigned logical layer changing coordinates 
clustering may examples prepared agglomerative clustering scheme starting singletons merging layers minimum status difference pair nodes different layers threshold depending number nodes network 
crossing reduction 
step layering nodes introduce bend points lines need cross layer 
goal find readability problems caused close layers horizontal orderings nodes bend points layer number crossing lines small 
note number crossings depends ordering actual coordinates 
finding ordering minimizes number crossing lines hard problem garey johnson time affects readability interpretation 
common heuristic layer sweep ordering say layer fixed second layer reordered reduce number crossings 
order second layer fixed third layer reordered 
reaching layer process reversed repeated layering yield improvement 
note minimizing number crossings neighboring layers ordering layer fixed hard eades wormald 
practice layer problem solved optimally instances computationally involved method nger 
general number crossing minimum anyway simpler barycenter heuristic placing node average position neighbors layer obtain initial ordering 
global sifting applied reduce number remaining crossing 
roughly speaking global sifting picks node time finds locally optimal position layer probing 
combination heuristics perform quite satisfactory experiences suggest additional effort caused sifting worth 
horizontal placement 
coordinates layering ordering nodes bend points layer remains compute actual coordinates respecting horizontal orderings 
pleasing visualizations obtained ensuring long lines run vertical possible reducing horizontal distance spanned
