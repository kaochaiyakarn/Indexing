advantages proposed architecture aggregates user related profiles diverse sources advantages 
construction personalized profile profiles collected environmental sensors example value interpreted differently user 
system possible infer user context preferences interpreting general profiles user intentions 
profiles high correlation dynamically linked 
personal repository user experiences user terminals different capabilities requires centralized data repository 
assume user home server available pa useful data utilized generated user daily life periodically synchronized pa system supports management user knowledge information history user experiences 
decision maker creating services aggregated profiles employed merely sharing information users making decisions needed dynamically create context aware service 
confederation aggregators helps creating new services

user goes shopping appropriate shopping location recommended personalized profiles current location shopping list shop membership list nearby shop information 
shopping information displayed suitable time registering user schedule 
shopping mall floor information database registered user pa user obtains shop information user preference location 
user may consult database searching locations easily navigate potential locations 
pa automatically checks shopping list buying item
