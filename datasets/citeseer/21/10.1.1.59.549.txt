contributions attempt propose combination rdf owl soap useful building semantic web services sws show combine technically 
soap envelope comprises header control data body transaction data 
defined xml schema syntactically semantically resulting inflexibility web services invocation 
rdf owl introduce ontology semantics soap 
provide level sws level combinations plus base level easy comparison 
sws level internal translation process multiple data formats internally translating format soap 
sws level simple pointing link owl individual soap allow service receiver decide process 
useful business cases product service promotion 
sws level direct embed owl individual soap envelope define types messages wsdl owl classes xml schema 
useful add semantics gradually current web service infrastructure 
sws level semantic soap relax nearly constraints wsdl receive send understand process semantic soap encoded general ontology 
useful casual integration agents met 
motivation ontology markup added kind resource semantic web 
added web sites 
added multimedia 
added web services 
additions improve ability computers processing data producing sophisticated useful applications 
instance adding semantic markup web service resulted semantic web services sws enable automatic service discovery service composition service interoperation :10.1.1.12.7316
focuses web services invocation 
look soap messages exchanged web services kind resource try add semantic markup 
reasons focus web services invocation 
adding semantics soap messages grabbed broad attention building semantic web services sws 
example consider semantics vertical layer may exploited horizontal layers service description publishing discovery trading partners service flow composition 
obviously regard semantics xml messaging soap important element framework semantic web enabled web services 
second adding semantics soap messages enhance flexibility integration 
current web services infrastructure xsd syntactically defines soap envelope including header control data body payload 
consequently achieve transactions internet commerce web services choose package xml schema xml frameworks internet commerce 
hard communicate 
inflexibility efficient regular tested transactions infeasible casual transactions product advertisement 
try soap messages meaningful simplify wsdl improve flexibility 
third reduce ambiguity transactions 
partner mm dd represent date uses dd mm easy communicate 
explicitly specifying semantics data type help clarify ambiguity 
resulting new type sws different current sws see table aims issues 
web service wants communicate web service met resolve issues 
send message effort adapt web service definition 

understand message sent

changes happen internal software agents physically implement web services 
internal translation required agent process xml framework agents may different vendors various operations 
translation service developed incrementally independently meaning incrementally adding translated frameworks cxml rosettanet owl adding framework translate disrupt quality translating previous frameworks

basic idea simply encode owl individual class soap 
looks pointing link service receiver decide connect process 
fig soap listing 
rdf encoding style points owl individual order class 
fig wsdl seller web service 
see message types remain called simplifies writing wsdl kind web services 
propose simple rdfs vocabulary describe owl individual 
instance shown soap body fig

soap message fig leaves receiving web services decide connect owl individual connect transport protocols ignore invocation 
sws level provide mechanism receiving web service decide connect process individual conditions reject conditions met web service gets individual reason ontology provided sender 
semantic web technologies help owl individual understood 
propose simple messaging 
simplicity speed complex web service developments 
instance suppose want build composite web service normally complex composing simple web services ws ws web service operation web services invoked sequence ws ws ws ws format consistency checking 
small inconsistency disrupt composition 
complexity exponentially increase considering requirements security reliability transactions 
easy fulfill aspects requirements composition 
better start simple build complex project incrementally 
useful business cases product service promotion ordinarily required receiving web services casual simple messages high possibility omitted
