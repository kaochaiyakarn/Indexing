defeasible assumptions appear problems involve dealing uncertain world 
assumptions crucial simply address possible situations occur

diagnosis engines usually assumption failures rare say components failed 
assumption crucial diagnosis engine consider possible failure modes interactions

framework particularly suited studying plausibility changes time 
important intuition capture minimal change 
suppose agent gets new information time certainly expect plausibility assessment beliefs time incorporate new information expect assessment time changed minimally assessment time probabilistic reasoning argued conditioning captures intuition

hand capture km update need put mild restrictions changes environment strong restrictions agent initial plausibility measure 
particular agent initial plausibility measure prefer runs abnormal events occur late possible 
means agent consider run slight abnormality early stage run abnormal event occurs time event surprising

particular claim restrictions imposed km update agent prior plausibility measures unreasonable situations 
general want pure revision update 
agent observation may need revise earlier beliefs assume change occurred world 
see consider example variant kautz stolen car example car parked full fuel tank time time owner returns find parked left 
owner believes parked cars tend stay put believe changes occurred time 
believe time discovers fuel tank empty 
update treats observation indication change time example gas leak 
revision hand treats indication previous beliefs belief tank full time wrong 
practice agent may want consider number possible explanations time observation depending considers sequence events time time 
example previous gas leaks may consider gas leak chapter 
plausible explanation 
hand spouse car keys may consider possible car absence 
reasonable approach lets capture considerations natural manner 
chapter show get applying straightforward ideas probability theory qualitative setting 
approach propose starts agent prior plausibility measure runs 
described get minimal change beliefs condition prior new knowledge 
agent beliefs determined initial prior 
obvious problem approach possible states uncountably possible runs 
agent describe prior plausibility complex space 
similar problem occurs probability theory want describe probability measure possible runs measure called 
standard solution assume state transitions independent occur probability system going state state independent sequence transitions brought system state markov assumption significantly reduces complexity problem 
necessary describe probability state transitions 
markov assumption shown widely applicable practice kemeny snell howard 
show chapter qualitative analogue markov assumption simplify description prior plausibility 
making qualitative markov assumption gives behaved notion belief change making occasionally unreasonable assumptions belief revision update 
particular allows user weigh relative plausibility observation due change word due inaccuracy previous beliefs
