today middleware systems follow request reply paradigm client requests particular service server sending request message performing remote method invocation rmi receives reply return 
mode operation works local area network lan context moderate number clients servers scale large networks internet 
request reply paradigm allows communication model forces tight coupling involved parties

type attribute publish subscribe traditionally impedance mismatch programming language objects events 
content pub sub systems view events untyped collections attribute value pairs modem programming languages support statically dynamically typed objects 
result event middleware support proper event typing events treated firstclass programming language objects 
cambridge event architecture cea developed idea mind hermes follows approach associating event subscription event type type checked 
event type contains number data fields attributes 
call underlying model type attribute publish subscribe 
publish subscribe systems divided content systems 
topic systems allow subscriber specify topic interest shortcoming filtering finer granularity 
hand content subscriptions allow filtering depending event data large scale system grouping events related types topics help manage large number different events 
type attribute system combination event subscriber specifies event type topic interested supplies filter expression operates attributes provided event type 
middleware knows event type definition type check events subscriptions inform user mismatches 
helps build robust distributed system especially environment event types evolving 
event type managed event broker functions rendezvous node type 
event types organised event type hierarchies similar class hierarchies object oriented language 
means event types derived inheritance create specialised types 
subscription operates parent type match events descendent type supertype subscription 
global type hierarchy enforced independent hierarchies distinct root types exist 
single global hierarchy enforced intemet scale

pub sub layers exchange kinds messages overlay network layer type messages add new event types system set rendezvous nodes 
type message contains definition event type stored rendezvous node 
published events type checked definition 
advertisement messages denote event publisher capability publishing certain event type

fault tolerance entire design fault tolerance plays important role large scale middleware system link node failures frequent wide area networks nodes 
hermes takes advantage fault tolerance repair mechanisms provided overlay routing layer 
enables survive multiple link broker failures adapt routing state deliver events subscribers 
entire state event brokers soft state refreshed periodically 
ensures neighbours event broker reachable alive 
general hermes middleware handle different kinds failure different techniques available 
link failure link failure short long term inability node contact logical neighbours 
caused failure ip routing level 
overlay routing algorithm adapt logical topology broker network circumvent failed link :10.1.1.111.1818:10.1.1.1.4196
affect event dissemination tree limited degree 
event broker failure regular heartbeat message detect failed event brokers absence communication 
failed broker cause gap event dissemination tree 
heal tree event broker detected failure re routes subscriptions advertisements previously went failed broker rendezvous node 
overlay network adapted new path different broker set old path expire time soft state 
event client failure failure event publisher event subscriber handled entirely soft state approach hermes 
event client failed refreshing advertisements subscriptions 
routing state network expire time 
rendezvous node failure prevent rendezvous nodes single points failure replicated 
event client receive rendezvous node sending subscription advertisement message try contacting replica 
node id replica rendezvous node obtained concatenating salt value event type name calculating hash function 
loadbalancing latency reasons event client replicated rendezvous nodes primary contact point 
transparently handled fault tolerance module middleware layer 
challenge keep consistency replicated rendezvous nodes ensure event dissemination trees cover replicas 
problem similar multicast multiple cores described 
subscriber able contact replicated rendezvous nodes able receive events coming event publishers attached different replica 
different techniques identified achieve currently working simulating respective benefits 
clients subscribe rns client issues subscription separately send subscription replicated rendezvous nodes 
global subscription rendezvous nodes contacted 
event publisher may advertise rendezvous node 
subscriptions expensive terms message counts 
clients advertise rns event publisher advertises event types replicas subscribers may subscribe replica 
creates overhead event publisher system 
rns exchange subscriptions event clients subscribe single replica replica subscribes ones 
case network partitions replicas subscriber potentially receive events able subscribe long replica reachable 
replicas need support reconciliation protocol re join network partition 
rns exchange advertisements scheme replicas exchange advertisements 
scalable previous scheme number subscriptions exceeds number advertisements system
