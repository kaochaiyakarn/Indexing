linguistic complexity user utterances extremely low domain timetable inquiries linguistic complexity quite simple 
initial utterance dialog shows highest complexity far nearly utterances elliptic consist just words

processing partial utterances vital robustness handle recognition errors spontaneous phenomena typical utterance grammatically formed 
processing partial descriptions parser dialog manager solves problems introduced phenomena 
quality synthesized speech influence users speech depending quality synthesizer intelligible speed machine human voice users clarity speaking style vary 
clear non human voice prefered human voice users talking humans tend lazy grammar clearness usage words 
system responses seconds acceptable immediate response prefered users accept wait system utterance utterance directs dialog goal 
waiting system just respond isolated question confirmation boring humans tend express ways verbal prosodic forms 
realizing hung connection germany feedback provided telekom hook phone side 
apart simple crack usually audible message disconnected line 
acoustic recognizer needs timeout feature dialog strategies watch subsequent timeouts order finish call 
situation satisfying characterized workaround 
humans tendency react unpredictable way get angry machine mistakes 
models humans behavior incomplete 
variety possible spoken reactions large investigate corpus analysis techniques 
large corpora clarify distinction typicality randomness user reactions 
current handcrafted models viewed light modified better comprehension human machine interaction 
system performs better just sequence components 
traditional methods sequential systems modules recognizer parser dialog manager estimate system success product modules performance probabilities 
dialog system strict sequence filters closed loop 
robust methods system cf
