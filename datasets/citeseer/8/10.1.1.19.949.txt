experiment task robot performed asking poll question 
number reasons choosing task 
implementation point view short constrained interaction scripted hand relatively easily 
feedback robot needs give order appear understood human response minimal necessity integrated speech recognition system 
people egocentric interested sharing opinions believe expect reasonable degree cooperation participants 
poll contains elements interaction interested studying particularly aspect engaging people interaction having deal complexity full way conversation 
think success task indicate significant step longer complicated natural interactions 
robot script poll task ran follows 
robot waits detect area interest 
robot detects begins tracking 
robot pay attention exclusively person interaction finished 
person stops robot ask answer poll question 
robot ask poll question asking step microphone mounted pan tilt head answer 
person step forward prompted times 
person hasn cooperated robot tells person giving ends interaction 
person steps forward robot detects threshold distance robot interprets response question 
currently speech recognition onboard robot available cue person answered 
robot waits person step back outside threshold 
fail prompted step back times robot gives 
person outside threshold robot determines interaction person says goodbye 
interaction repeated nearest individual 
observed number people passed robot greeted stopped responded poll question finished interaction 
response variable recorded experiment person stopped greeted robot 
number provides measure success attracting people interact success completing interaction 
relatively people number stopped completed interaction 
major reasons people understand robot synthesized speech people step close robot answer robot prompt step closer 
answer distance frustrated robot hear 
experiment design interested exploring effects expression emotion indication attention robot success initiating interaction 
face ability move robot relies solely verbal cues attempt engage people interaction

turning person talking robot removes ambiguity 
gaze important way people initiate interaction cue recognizable familiar people 
face offers additional level expressiveness accompaniment speech acts facial expressions output speech synthesis package modulated indicate emotion supports people desire robot 
people find interaction robot human face appealing robot face
