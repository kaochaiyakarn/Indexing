gsd discovery protocol protocol concepts peer peer caching advertisements services group selective forwarding requests daml semantic information service requests service descriptions 
helps achieve efficient network bandwidth usage gives increased flexibility service matching process 
peer peer caching services gives protocol distributed approach different centralized semi centralized service discovery protocols 
service advertisements service advertisements initiated individual node hosting services 
service corresponding service description daml ontology 
node adv time interval sends list services nodes radio range 
peer nodes radio range considered hop sending node 
source send advertisement multiple hops 
case field adv diameter advertisement packet set number hops advertisement expected travel 
greater number hops number nodes vicinity receives advertisement 
comes cost increased number messages 
incorporation adv diameter helps regulating extent advertisement reach intelligently different mobility situations 
adv time interval parameter depends mobility node general mobility manet 
highly dynamic situations desirable small adv time interval vicinity changes rapidly vice versa 
advertisement packet consists fields packet type source address service description service groups groups lifetime adv diameter node contains broadcast id broadcast id increases monotonically broadcast node 
source address broadcast id disambiguate duplicate advertisements 
service description contain information service groups locally sender node 
advertisement packet contains field called groups 
field contains enumerated list groups non local services sender node seen vicinity 
information obtained service cache explained section iii 
lifetime field determines length time advertisement cached receiver node 
entry node advertisement expired 
peer peer caching node manet maintains finite cache store service descriptions remote services 
node receives service advertisement performs steps duplicate advertisement discard packet extract service description extract group information store entry service cache set lifetime entry entry service cache contains fields source address local service description service groups groups lifetime service cache node contains list local remote services node seen advertisements 
field groups contain list groups corresponding source address seen vicinity 
case local service field empty 
lifetime cache entry determined corresponding advertisement packet 
fast moving nodes manet small lifetime advertisements 
service cache full lowest lifetime policy remove entry cache 
entry lifetime cache 
cache entry lifetime expires 
request routing service request originates source application layer requests certain service 
service request described daml ontology 
firstly request description matched services local cache source node 
virtue peer peer caching local cache ideal scenario contains descriptions services nodes adv diameter hops 
comparing request local cache protocol automatically able check availability service adv diameter hops 
simple broadcast protocol caching broadcast request nodes vicinity 
protocol achieves increase efficiency discovering service available vicinity 
match local cache service request constructed 
service request contains fields packet type service description request groups source address address hop count field request groups contain service group request belongs 
hop count specifies number hops request travel 
specified source request 
determines search radius discovering service vicinity 
standard broadcast solutions calls broadcasting request peer nodes vicinity 
efficient far bandwidth usage concerned 
groups information entry service cache determine set neighboring nodes selectively forward service request 
groups field service cache entry specifies groups services sender advertisement seen vicinity 
request belongs groups chance requested service available near node sending advertisement 
broadcasting request protocol selectively forwards request nodes seen group services vicinity 
pseudo code algorithm follows hop count request packet entry service cache request groups gn belongs groups decrease hop count packet 
forward service request node request forwarded decrease hop count packet 
broadcast request neighboring nodes 
service advertisement sent node nodes vicinity field groups constructed manner entry service cache local group gm belonging service groups gi groups add gi groups list groups services seen sender advertisement sent advertisement 
way sending limited group information services advertisements intelligently regulate direction service request travels 
method sending group related information impose memory problems sending service descriptions services seen node case lead cache overloading 
reverse path setup request packet contains address field contains address node request coming 
node addition maintaining service cache maintains reverse route table 
reverse route table contains entries source address previous address reverse route table updated request forwarded nodes vicinity 
entry table kept rev route timeout time units 
value rev route timeout depends hop count request packet 
hop count request packet value rev route timeout increases accordingly 
entry send service reply back source request 
source address uniquely identifies reply packet corresponds request packet 
service reply generation request matches service description node irrespective service local node generates service reply 
node updates reverse route table entry 
service reply contains fields packet type service description source address destination address address source hop count destination address source pair look reverse route table find previous address send reply 
reply follows path request traveled 
multiple replies generated reply may potentially follow separate path source request 
hop count incremented intermediate node address changed intermediate node reflect actual previous node address reply coming 
field kept purposes 
service matching module node contains lightweight service matching module performs activities 
matches service request service description service cache 
services matched service groups input outputs functional similarity service capabilities matching module may potentially semantic features class subclass unionof daml increase richness service matching 
module provides functionalities extract group related information service description daml ontology 
fill respective entries service advertisements service requests
