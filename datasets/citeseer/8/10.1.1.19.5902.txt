useful introspection expert different field computer science reflect experience intended users 
experts tend remember imagine user interface design experience far questions assumptions fears actual users

cognitive scientists may surprised theories suggest user finds model incorrect correct model 
designers may upset feel designs correctly 
designers reliably introspect settings conditions new technology learned 
example users learn technology conditions require multiple ongoing splitting attention may due complex collaborative relationships 
questionnaires interviews frequently 
questionnaires limited stimulus response model interaction assumes question stimulus meaning subjects

model excludes interactions establish shared meaning subject interviewer 
open ended interviews allow constrained interaction interviewer interviewee longer considered subject experiment

include 
ethnomethodology requires naturally occurring data collected situation having significant social interaction members engaged activities regularly ordinarily 

ethnomethodology requires analyst understand members concepts methods 
necessary analyst understand certain members concepts methods certain degree achieve certain pragmatic goal difficult determine understood degree 

ethnomethodology requires grounding observations concrete circumstances social production 
design technical artifacts requires abstractions formalizations grounded 
particular methods ethnomethodology applied directly systems built 

practical point view important limitation methods ethnomethodology labor intensive 
particular take skilled person long time produce transcript videotape live interaction 
typical projects involve hundreds hours recording transcribing analyzing data 
regarding point data collected natural social situation principle accountability apply sure events data natural social significance 
precludes number convenient quick dirty ways collecting information questionnaires 
controlled experiments unsuitable sources data solitary operators equipment 
second point fairly general agreement prior method ethnomethodology necessary ethnography achieve prior orientation social milieu studied 
look ethnography guidelines ethnomethodology presupposes appropriate level understanding 
ethnographic literature provide help definite pragmatic goals working interface technology sociology develop suitable guidelines 
third point note design technical artifact typically formal object 
example design may expressed blueprint building computer program control machine tool entire automated factory 
similarly design information system typically expressed formal notations furthermore information system seen formal object nontrivial way part program written formal programming language running formally describable computer
