sections describe hyperdoc system developed demonstrate approach 
hyperdoc project undertaken fifteen people period approximately months 
objective explore issues producing hyper documentary generating media authoring story templates rendering presentation viewing web 
firstly examine interface 

interface hyperdoc interface shown asks user provide pieces information type documentary see subject documentary preferences style content 
example user chose view documentary particular individual subject individual name 
gathering user preferences style content complex interface simple expressive provide complete set user requirements hyperdoc engine 
user modelling adaptive systems employ explicit modelling users questioned preferences interacting system 
provides high level detail user explicit modelling seen time consuming intrusive 
alternative technique implicit modelling obtains user preferences observations users activities interact system 
implicit modelling provides positive exemplars user actions requires lengthy user interaction ability track users multiple sessions 
hyperdoc system currently provide interaction allow implicit user modelling 
compromise combine user preferences single interface component case slider graphical object moved various settings drag drop mouse action 
user slider indicate required style presentation loosely known television styles 
slider moves labels bbc mtv 
bbc represents formal content rich presentation mtv represents quick light presentation 
user chooses position settings depending required presentation 
slider produces value mapped style metadata depth mood described section

gathering content content important trying produce multiple stories narratives 
large corpus media fragments possibilities dynamic adaptation limited 
hyperdoc added requirements needed media fragments atomic possible deliverable web copyright 
decided produce hyper documentary iam group university southampton 
large group researchers worked years 
hyperdoc added group web site allowing visitors obtain novel view people research activities group technology 
discussed content appropriate subject produced right forms deciding initial areas 
video interviews academic staff 
approximately fifteen members academic staff group 
interviewing fixed set questions hoped gain body interviews form basis 
questions relation staff members projects 
best person worked 
questions type reused multiple stories 
video interview scripts added archive 

photographs groups social archives

addition photographic material asked professor wendy hall group founder record audio narration photograph 

pictures video shots campus groups laboratory 
taken give rest material kind context 

brief textual descriptions group projects taken iam web pages additional exposition 
hoped having large set multimedia fragments containing information related axis story layer able create different paths information 
music media forms currently omitted hyperdoc music 
music method creating continuity discrete scenes 
continuous looping mood music adequate presentation achieve certain effects user preferences example piece light presentation music story structure desirable 
mean scenes music structure example changing scene music beats requires substantial processing presentation layer detect appropriate markers care taken presentation ensure presentation disjointed

complexities added music prototype hyperdoc 
intention experiment music time 
music tracks royalty free sources available internet commercially project 
storing media captured stored central infrastructure machine urls access 
urls chosen provide abstraction method file delivery videos streamed rtsp images text delivered 
break data fragments storage interview stored single video file store indexes meta data free relational dbms mysql database treats individual answers separate objects 
database schema consists distinct types media objects region objects metadata descriptors relations 
media object mo describes physical file example recording 
mo provides url mime type 
region object ro sub divides mo distinct describable chunks 
example time range single answer video interview paragraph text document area image representing individual group photograph 
metadata object md contains metadata describing fragment information 
decided dublin core basis metadata specific qualifications higher narrative layers describing mood style content 
initially considered allowed enter metadata instance constructing categorisation system encoding data easier encoding carried individuals order consistent 
list metadata shown table 
relation object provides typed pair relation media region metadata objects 
requires tables md md md mo md ro ro mo 
structural triples metadata relation objects 
tables source relation target 
example metadata entry contributor id metadata object contributor triple type value 
relation md ro table describes metadata object describes region object 
table joins triples provide extensible flexible mechanism expressing queries example return region object ids metadata object describes region object relation contributor contributor 
drawback triples computational complexity computing large numbers table joins especially result sets large 
authoring system place store simple mechanisms needed enable authoring constituent material 
encoding media suitable format relatively straightforward process easily automated marking material metadata perceived extra burden author 
fundamental rationale hyper documentary authoring metadata forms crucial part process metadata adaptive story constructed 
majority source media hyper documentary authored situations simultaneous metadata creation possible recording video camera markup secondary activity occurring subsequent time 
envisage additional metadata production stages users system author annotations enrich content 
aid scenario developed set web pages php server side scripting language query create objects hyperdoc database 
comprised main dialogues allowing author md element description title short human readable description creator id author subject string representing subject matter publisher publishing organisation contributor id persons contributed date created creation date source type semantic type meta data question answer coverage starting date subject coverage date subject rights organisation owns rights description mood mood data trivial serious description depth amount detail data deep shallow mo ro element description format described media source id original item isbn url language language 
add new media object media url mime type 
create region objects associate media objects 
generate metadata object associate media region objects 
create relationship metadata objects web forms ease process metadata authoring relatively laborious lengthy task 
explored ideas assist metadata generation 
involved recording short video diary entries pc attached web cam 
facility available iam group week encouraged entries 
controlled environment metadata relating media type time date length captured automatically remaining metadata gathered prompted questions part recording process 
second initiative provided members research group email address carbon copy emails concerning hyperdoc project 
harvest metadata automatically original email data hoped build body background information useful hyperdoc 
cases user response disappointing produce material add final system 
simple metadata gathering systems appear barrier prevent wide participation 
limited experience conclude metadata authoring need fully automated associated technical privacy problems table metadata elements come vested interest creating 

story structuring certain perspective hypertext seen sequencing task allows dynamic paths followed collection interlinked fragments 
traditional hypertext systems allow reader explore information space freely consequence offer little support narrative 
technologies offer solutions particular trails tours create rigid structure readers may choose follow 
dynamic approach offered hypertext systems initially interlinked links removed set conditions
