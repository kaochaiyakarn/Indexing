haystack platform huynh designed store manage personal information mail documents contacts meetings types data semi structured nature better expressed semantic networks tables 
believe system primary data model semi structured intrinsic needs 
semantic data networks inevitably grow need organize conveniently flexibly navigate systematically 
second enormous amount structured unstructured data existence system allow data exchange outside world extend knowledgebase facilitate collaboration users systems 
third consequence collaboration managing cooperation services various systems important 
cooperation requires trust management different sources information 
haystack provide built solutions needs organization external data integration service cooperation trust management 
discusses various techniques fulfill needs 

resource description framework haystack resource description framework rdf rdf primary data model 
rdf core technologies developed semantic web project designed specifically modeling semistructured data 
basic unit data rdf statement takes form triple subject predicate object 
predicate arrow pointing subject object graph nodes 
addition predicates treated graph nodes 
predicate thought attribute name form statements attribute self 
example age said numeric 
reason distinguish rdf entities functions subject predicate object distinguish functions content holders 
rdf resource resource short concept concrete entity named unique resource identifier uri 
rdf literal string xml fragment holds content 
necessary define kinds predicates expected certain resources 
example resource represents book expect predicate named publisher exist 
rdf schema standard rdf schema specifies notions rdf class rdf property properties associated classes 
rdf defines built type predicate allowing resources declared types 
notion classes properties simply resources type class property respectively properties expressed uri property predicate 

organization navigation order help user systematically navigate personal information repository needs organization data user system 
existing software sole facility organization hierarchy containers mail folders file directories 
item organized fall container reality belong 
furthermore filed away item remains sight mind longer serve reminder pending task associated 
resolve problems introducing predicate links data item zero category resources 
essence predicate performs semantic tagging constraining storage location data item 
data item easily classified categories 
categorization mechanism useful scenarios ranging orga mail messages classifying capabilities software components agents 
purpose organization categorization set inclusion collections 
collection mathematical set objects 
collection uses predicate link collection resource elements 
categories collections principle membership containment item belong collections 
collections manage groups items set people room set documents notes relevant meeting set agents notifications needing user attention 

external data integration important address haystack interacts unstructured data existing world 
today urls represent documents images web pages content accessible file system world wide web 
advent technologies xml namespaces rdf larger class identifiers called uris subsumed urls 
initially rdf provided means annotating web content 
web pages identified urls referred rdf statements subject field connected metadata rdf content retrievable urls 
powerful notion existing storage infrastructure 
content described rdf question naturally arises store content rdf 
argue best solution reasons 
storing content rdf incompatible existing infrastructure 
second leveraging existing infrastructure efficient rdf encoding retrieve files 
require existing unstructured content stored rdf store user unstructured data existing technologies standard file 
service cooperation applying rdf describing agent interface protocol endpoint metadata done leveraging existing standards 
specification called web services description language wsdl christensen provides xml format describing metadata 
xml tags wsdl expressed rdf properties querying connectivity metadata simply special case general rdf query mechanism exposed rdf metadata store 
additionally defining custom rdf properties developers annotate agent descriptions arbitrary attributes reliability physical location degrees user preference 

trust management system myriad collaborators computer agents process information multiple agents generate conflicting information 
consider example agent determines due date document natural language processing agent date finds 
important agents results tagged authorship metadata user informed choice result choose case conflict 
giving rdf statements identifiers reification making statements statements identifiers 
framework recording statement metadata examine issues retraction denial expiration assertions statements asserted specific parties 
consider example agent responsible generating title property web pages 
web pages contents updated daily titles change constantly 
approach handling constant mutations information store allow agents replace outdated statement date version 
powerful allow users queries form find web pages title car maintenance tips point time allowing agents retract delete statements queries retrieve obsolete information information deleted 
additionally system permits users override statement agent denying statement retains denied assertion
