information available access logs site html may sufficient discuss support adaptivity meta information information page content 
examine issues arise designing adaptive web sites 
customization customization adjusting site presentation individual user 
customization allows fine grained improvement interface may completely tailored individual user 
way site respond particular visitors allow manual customization allowing users specify display options remembered entire visit visit 
microsoft network www msn com example allows users create home pages customized news information displays 
time individual visits msn home page sees latest site customizations 
path prediction hand customizes automatically attempting guess user wants go quickly 
path prediction system answer questions 
ffl predicting 
may try predict user step 
example predict link page particular user follow highlight link bring top page 
alternatively may try predict user eventual goal determine page site visitor looking immediately 
ffl basis predictions 
particular individual actions predict go 
hand generalize multiple users gather data quickly 
ffl kinds modifications basis predictions 
may little highlighting selected links making bold putting graphics example synthesizing brand new page think user wants see 
webwatcher armstrong see www cs cmu edu webwatcher learns predict links users follow particular page function specified interests 
webwatcher observes users time attempts learn user current page stated interests go 
link webwatcher believes follow highlighted graphically duplicated top page 
visitors site asked broad terms looking 
depart asked wanted 
webwatcher uses paths people indicated success examples successful navigations 
example people looking personal home pages follow people link webwatcher tend highlight link visitors goal

assuming users behave somewhat rationally actions precondition postcondition representation reason user done trying 
web domain observe visitor navigation site try determine page seeking 
quickly accurately offer desired page immediately 
challenge formalize user navigation web planning process amenable goal recognition 
user actions web carry evidence purpose 
avanti project fink see zeus gmd de projects avanti html focuses dynamic customization users needs tastes 
webwatcher avanti relies partly users providing information enter site 
knows user avanti attempts predict user eventual goal step 
avanti prominently links leading directly pages thinks user want see 
additionally avanti highlight links accord user interests 
avanti illustrated hypothetical louvre museum web site 
example disabled tourist comes site links regarding disabled access tourist information emphasized 
avanti relies users providing information initial dialogue site uses information guide customization user exploration site 
avanti attempts guess user go looked far 
example disabled tourist looks number paintings site avanti emphasize paintings links continues serve pages 
webwatcher ask avoid avanti requirement users explicitly provide information 
optimization customization focuses individuals optimization tries improve site 
making changes user site learns users site easier 
approach allows new users know benefit improvements 
may view web site design particular point vast space possible designs 
improving site corresponds searching space better design 
assuming way measuring better may view classical ai search problem 
possible quality metric measure amount effort visitor needs exert average order find looking site 
effort defined function number links traversed difficulty finding links 
example site popular local page buried links away front page improved making page accessible readily obvious link front page 
navigate space performing transformations site adding removing links rearranging links creating new web pages guarantee transformation improves quality site performing hillclimbing search 
challenge large search space appropriate search strategy 
restructure space avoid searching large portions 
perkowitz etzioni sketch design system repertoire transformations aim improve site organization transformations include rearranging highlighting links synthesizing new pages 
system learns common patterns user access logs decides transform site exploit patterns site easier navigate 
example web site department introductory computer science course contains web page homework assignment course 
assignment due date solution set assignment available 
system observe assignment due date visitors look solution set fact solution set popular pages site 
observation lead system promote solution set giving prominent link front page 
promotion making link page prominent simple effective transformation 
implemented form promotion existing web site approximately daily page accesses automatically generated links roughly visitors click link 
course note promoting link may self fulfilling making page prominent may increase popularity artificially inflating site apparent success adaptation 
ambitious transformation clustering synthesizing brand new web page contains links set related objects 
available data system infer set pages site related group 
inference content number pages cover topic user navigation patterns visitors page particularly visit certain final exams approach students tend look multiple solutions sets visit 
solution pages linked directly visitors navigate intervening pages 
pattern suggests solution sets form meaningful group visitors heads appear web site solution sets linked respective assignment pages 
system create new page link solution set new page available visitors site 
currently implementing clustering transformations user navigation data 
meta information web site ability adapt hampered limited knowledge content structure provided html 
example suppose page contains list links 
appropriate add new link top list 
answer depends contents list adaptive site add link course home page list links faculty home pages furthermore list alphabetical order new item added appropriate point 
clearly site ability adapt enhanced providing meta information information content structure organization 
section discuss means providing adaptive site sort information 
way provide meta information represent site content formal framework precisely defined semantics database semantic network 
approach pioneered strudel web site management system fernandez attempts separate information available web site graphical presentation 
manipulating web sites level pages links web sites may specified strudel view definition language 
addition web sites may created updated issuing strudel queries 
example create home pages employees merging data manager employee databases 
page created person database 
furthermore manager page links employees vice versa 
approach facilitate adaptivity strudel enable site reason logical description detect cases adaptations violate existing logic 
furthermore adaptive site easily transform issuing strudel queries strudel provides mechanisms automatically update site appropriately 
drawback strudel approach requires site entire content encoded set databases wrappers map web pages information sources strudel 
cost constructing wrappers existing web sites particularly relatively unstructured sites appears high 
lighter weight approach annotate existing web site meta content tags 
approach formal description content html documents 
may choose site annotate complex annotations 
meta content annotation facilitates reasoning connections parts site provides guidance changes 
approach type apple meta content format see mcf research apple com 
mcf attempt establish standard meta content annotation web 
user visits site mcf enabled browser choose navigate site dimensional representation site structure determined site mcf annotation 
shoe luke www cs umd edu projects plus shoe takes different tack 
shoe language adding simple ontologies web pages 
shoe adds basic ontological declarations html page refer particular ontology declare classifications relations pages 
example man home page annotated information fact person name occupation wife identity home page 
shoe designed facilitate exploration agents workings search tools ontological annotation support adaptation 
lighter weight strudel meta content tagging clear disadvantages 
meta content annotation separated actual content updated manually content changes 
second meta content attached existing html provides direct support automatic adaptation adaptation modify original html 
approaches described far require fair amount effort build maintain content descriptions 
wish facilitate adaptation effort may overkill 
alternative actively investigating extremely lightweight annotation system designed specifically adaptivity 
annotations form directives adaptive system telling may may changes kinds changes 
example add list tag html allow describe elements list ordered 
list declared list order unordered tells system may reorder list way chooses 
list declared list order popularity case system draw data access logs determine list 
list declared list order alphabetical 
list order chronological 
modified additions deletions long original ordering constraint preserved 
tags sort part adaptive html language called html perkowitz etzioni intention extend html higher level abstraction allowing web designer describe objects terms time relevance organization interrelationships 
note approach require global establishment html standard adaptive site uses server capable interpreting html translating standard html runtime 
resulting html served response page requests 
open questions quest self improving web site raises number related questions 
adaptive site active hours day days week 
site constantly analyzing data adjusting concepts models updating structure presentation 
time constant cycle reflect hours experience refinement 
past ai research focused single trials short lived entities systems run experiments shut start day blank slate 
approach may applied adaptive site challenge intelligent site surely continually accumulates knowledge pages users content 
user interface design difficult human beings perform 
adaptive web site take account design self improvements 
limit scope system ability change ensuring harm means limit scope improvement 
hand giving system free rein radical transformation mean giving free rein radical 
challenge formalize concept design 
limit potential harm overly limiting potential 
put ai system role advisor human master 
making changes cover night ai system intelligently suggestions human complete ex justification 
solution frees problem changing details changing design presents new interface challenge 
challenge adaptive web site communicate suggestions webmaster 
evaluation problem measuring quality web site design thorny identified preliminary approaches 
progress design adaptive web sites include sophisticated methods evaluating site usability 
propose basic metric usable site effort user exert average order find wants 
discussed section effort defined function number links traversed difficulty finding links pages 
standard daily access log may approximately measure user effort 
standard log data sufficient know visitor navigation 
example standard logs distinguish individuals connecting location record link user followed 
software available provide complete information 
example see www com allows site track individual user progress including pages visited links followed 
analysis site structure data system sufficient measure user effort 
analysis user logs provides information users interact site 
addition may controlled tests subjects 
tests advantage allowing observe users interact site get information encoded user access logs 
subjects perform tasks finding information downloading software locating documents may gather data ffl subject succeeded task realized solvable 
ffl long subject took solve goal 
ffl exploration required 
careful observation test subjects complement limited access data get site regular visitors 
course rely intermediate measures encouraging users fill feedback forms send mail messages 
posed challenge ai techniques radically transform web sites today inert collections html pages hyperlinks intelligent evolving entities 
adaptive web sites popular pages accessible highlight interesting links connect related pages cluster similar documents 
adaptive web site perform self improvements autonomously advise site webmaster summarizing access information making suggestions 
improvements happen real time visitor navigating site offline observations culled visitors 
juxtaposed number disconnected projects knowledge representation machine learning user modeling investigating aspects problem
