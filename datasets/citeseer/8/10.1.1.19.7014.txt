names mean james toole david gifford naming fundamental issue distributed systems growing importance number directly accessible systems resources grows point difficult discover names files objects interest 
experience building system combines ideas location naming propose naming architecture called content names departure traditional tree structured hierarchy 
content name system name include description user seeks addition interesting file object 
experience implementation content names semantic file system suggests widely applicable distributed system architectures 
addition experience observed trend content names new distributed services archie system daemon 
discuss semantic file system implement content names examine feasibility context usenet publishing system 
keywords naming file systems distributed systems information systems naming fundamental unifying concept difference collection networked centralized computing systems true confederation computing systems lies ability system provide uniform way accessing naming resources machine independent 
distributed systems grown single local area networks world wide internetworks logistics discovering resources interest correspondingly complex 
growing complexity finding information information large network internet motivated wide variety new tools naming support 
example archie system provides line index files available public ftp sites 
alex system provides uniform naming system caching services span hosts internet underlying file system provides primitive ftp support

significant impact distributed computer systems enable rapid inter user exchange information 
take advantage potential interchange need anticipate kinds sharing supported tailor naming system support needs 
believe significant new distributed systems area information publishing naming systems need anticipate requirements application 
information publishing natural extension mailing lists file transfer bulletin board systems 
common way publish announce widely read mailing list anonymous ftp location publication 
electronic world physical world exist known libraries usually operated large ftp sites archive wide variety useful information source code technical reports back issues moderated mailing lists 
physical world library bookstore typically contains materials provide indexed listings available documents 
publish information physical electronic domain requires information widely available cost locating information small 
natural expect amount information published internet increases query access important names describe precisely file wanted 
query support needs integrated naming system way applications high performance protocols access data interest 
example video files indexed applications may desire content names locate video files interest need high performance protocols access files playback 
note suggest location access services integrated single easy protocol 
content names semantic file system provides flexible associative access stored information automatically extracting attributes stored objects 
associative access provided traditional file system interfaces access methods 
system block diagram shows basic building blocks prototype semantic file system 
semantic file system implementation uses network file system protocol interprets file pathnames content names 
dynamic interpretation content names file storage system allows users communicate easily 
inter user communications involve content names content names correctly interpreted storage system mean files desired exactly files located 
example content names quickly create browse usenet news articles related solving problems new modem cd sfs news subject bis text pathname semantic file system block diagram dcom dcom dcom uucp uucp dcom dcom example command specifies desired properties usenet news articles enumerated ls command 
desired files examined simple file browser 
nfs permits content names resolved pathnames symbolic links 
subsequent access files incurs performance penalty 
information publishing occurs naturally semantic file system stored information automatically advertised virtual directory mechanism 
virtual directory directory indistinguishable ordinary directory computed demand semantic file system 
virtual directories semantic file system provide convenient way interested viewers locate previously published information 
traditional content materials library card catalogs books print virtual directory method semantic file systems combines means locating materials interest means accessing 
example problem video usenet usenet largest distributed file system active today 
primary service provided usenet participating sites shared file system known newsgroups 
newsgroup names form tree structured directory namespace 
files stored directories articles submitted users 
new data added usenet newsgroups aggregate rate approximately megabytes day 
week period users submit new files sites 
measurements indicate participating sites approximately users actively read articles system 
current usenet architecture uses flooding broadcast distribution method replicate published data participating sites 
high volume new data submission sites rapidly delete data 
locally stored copies data deleted users desiring access data ad hoc methods locate possible archive sites 
fact non trivial fraction inter user communications usenet appears repetitions previous traffic efforts avoid traffic widely distributing frequently asked questions 
believe naming methods usenet serve primary needs users 
users typically submit articles describe desired information 
indicates naming system usenet content names 
amount information published day usenet continues increase rapidly increasing graphical video data lead explosive growth 
compressed graphics currently constitute new usenet data represents new articles 
slight increase photographic data produce major increase total usenet traffic volume 
publication minutes full motion video segment probably overload existing usenet infrastructure 
introducing content names fundamental part usenet shared file system offers potential advantages provides convenient access published articles 
encourages embedding article relationships storage system 
enables publication items large immediate broadcast 
content names introduced usenet ways 
attractive possibility provide virtual newsgroups content names 
newsgroups accessed existing usenet file protocol nntp 
nntp server dynamically interpret content names create virtual newsgroups demand 
possible nntp serve network file access protocol articles broadcast global naming system similar alex address specific storage locations 
basic primitives distributed publishing systems basic requirements information publishing distributed storage system require efficient means locating published information resources content 
storage access protocols integrate basic content primitives integrated network global naming local caching 
basic techniques support information publishing client server paradigm decoupling storage naming features traditional network file systems 
semantic file system architecture permits information publishing distributed system 
loosely coupled network file system protocols afs nfs provide convenient access content attribute information actual contents 
large items digitized video segments published unnecessary copying network wide uniquely identify objects virtual directories alex
