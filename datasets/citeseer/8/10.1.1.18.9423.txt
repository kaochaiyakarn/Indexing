revocation deletion classification authors classify revocation schemes dimensions resilience propagation dominance combined various ways provide distinct categories 
authors consider revocation certificates deletion privileges granted delegation chain 
way representing privileges delegations find instructive consider classification apply classification revocation schemes framework 
dimensions 
resilience concerns privilege may revoked way effects persistent say way agent may subsequently re create 
example effect obtained creating negative privilege override positive counterpart 
way subsequent granting positive privilege effect negative 

propagation concerns revocation privilege may indirect effects privileges stemming delegation chain 

dominance concerns agent may allowed revoke privileges directly delegated 
example case considered agent retains ability revoke delegations agents privileges obtained delegation chain stemming

distinguish access level permission management level authority 
perm represents access level permission says agent permitted perform action object auth represents management level authority says agent authority bring privilege access level permission management level authority 
term privilege refer access level permission management level authority 
note having authority create privilege necessarily mean enjoy privilege oneself authority create privilege oneself 
considered simplest type revocation possible invalidate certificate time revocation occurs times 
current generalise revocation type allowing disable certificate past permanently just specified period time 
means time revocation occurs time revoked certificate invalidated independent 
furthermore previous framework allowed issuer certificate revoke possible get effects indirectly 
consider number alternatives heading dominance 
framework authority management framework contains type actions issuing certificates revoking certificates 
certificates represented certifies issuer time stamp id 
intended reading follows issuer attempt time time stamp bring privilege holds time interval 
say certificate certifies contains privilege call validity interval certificate 
permission action access level action read write file 
management level authority form auth action creation privilege id unique identifier certificate 
simplicity leave parts certificate management system impact reasoning required determine privilege holds time 
particular validation signatures course essential component verifying certificate signatures part reasoning process verifying privilege holds reason signatures appear representation certificates 
revocations represented revokes issuer id time stamp 
revocations certificates seen time stamped statements 
contrast certificates revocation id contains id certificate subject revocation 
interval called disabling interval represents period time revocation disables certificate id id specifying disabling interval revocation disable particular instance privilege certificate temporarily permanently 
note revocation works certificates privilege created different certificates revoking necessarily disable privilege 
certificates revoked happen 
historical database certificates revocations possible determine privilege holds time 
informally privilege holds time point certificate declaring holds interval containing certificate effective sense issued time authority declare hold interval authority turn requires certificate effective time issued chain effective certificates back source authority accepted certification determined organisational structure

diagram issuer revokes time issuance revocation affect certificates support new certificate issued time propagation revocations needs revoke certificate way affects validity certificates 
typical scenario discovers agent abused authority 
fraudulent agent management role delegated privileges wants delete authority privileges delegated turn 
kind propagation revocations specified privilege calculus disabling certificate fraudulent agent authority 
certificate disabled way support certificates vanishes 
done revocation disabling interval containing time points past certificate supports certificates 
similar say said past true statement said hold 
framework presenting explicitly designed support retrospective effects 
note reasoning different time lines time certificate database time privilege certificate holds 
example picture certificate issued agent directly supports certificates issued time issued time 
assume different agents included group agents receive privilege 
certain time tx finds fraudulent agent authority deleted immediately 
authority deleted authorities delegated deleted 
revoking time tx disable support disappears 
revoking tx time tx 
simple revocation time tx issuer 
order delete privileges delegated revoke time way support relation disappears 
course consider revocation format allows disabling intervals specified revocation statement 
similarly devise kinds macros commonly occurring patterns revocation statements 
note support longer automatically support disappears 
support remains disabling interval include 
authority management structure created remains untouched 
able exercise time tx authority received issue new certificate time tx gives privilege dominance framework far issuer certificate possibility revoke 
relaxing constraint complicate framework privilege calculus necessary want support revocation schemes dominance dimension 
need 
deliberate feature framework agent issues certificate identify certificate necessary authority certificate record certificate invoked certificate issued 
design 
realistic view require agents say am issuing certificate authority certificate 
agent may know identifier case dormant chain 
consider 
bjorn goes sweden weekend unable revoke certificates issued gets back 
way try discover issued certificates bjorn ask revoke certificates bjorn privileges revoked 
clearly 
problem mitigated introducing kind representation mechanism allowing bjorn specify act absence 
solve problems 
deal case bjorn forgotten appoint representative done deliberately 
general approach decouple entirely authority privileges authority revoke certificates introducing separate predicates auth says authority bring predicate auth says authority delete 
enable delegate authorities separately 
able give authority create privilege agent authority delete privilege different agent 
general approach cover interesting scenarios great flexibility believe framework powerful difficult manage 
consider general approach similar discussed heading dominance 
agent authority revoke certificate issued certificate issued basis delegation chain stemming certificates issued 
rationale 
agent delegates authority agent retains responsibility actions delegatee 
natural say delegator retain measure control delegated authority 
certificate framework suggests delegator allowed revoke certificates issued basis original delegation acts 
reasoning dominance mechanism discussed 
framework associated calculus privileges modified straightforwardly 
simply replaces pc 
privilege calculus elaborate version 
example presently 
number outstanding points detail examined 
particular framework supports issuing certificates retrospective effects easy produce undesirable effects 
example wishes revoke certificate issued simply issue certificate granting authority create privilege certified certificate effective start dormant chain supporting certificate careful specifying dominance relation may allowed authority revoke circumstances 
solution restrict attention rooted chains grounds validity rests ultimately source authority actions need questioned 
second check compare times issuance certificates chain blocking retrospective revocation certificates dominance mechanism 
questions remain explored systematically 
illustrate calculus privileges modified support form dominance just discussed 
investigation forms dominance properties topic current research

possible derive equivalent computationally efficient formulations 
implementation issues options considered 
leave detailed discussion dealing practical aspects framework 
example picture issuer wants delete privilege supported deleting privilege privilege 
issuer revoke directly touching validity 
extension framework updating privileges means authority certificates order provide richer variety revocation schemes originally supported 
original provide associated calculus encoded logic program reasoning privileges hold times database access database time stamped attribute certificates revocations 
find classification scheme revocation mechanisms introduced dimensions resilience propagation dominance identified extremely illuminating helpful structuring investigations
