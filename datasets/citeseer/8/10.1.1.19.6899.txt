document general structure norm basic characteristics normative agents discussed section 
section main components multi agent system controlled norms analysed formalisation provided

changes occur system norms issued complied violated described formalised different stages processing norms section 
section set normative relationships agents provided 
norms normative agents section describe basic blocks build theory normative multi agent systems 
conceptual infrastructure provides basis broad theory underpins aspects included described 
means building formal model normative agent repetitive adopt smart agent framework described 
addition follows adopt specification language construct formal model schemas allow facilities easy transition specifications programmes 
schema contains parts declaration part declares local variables predicate part expresses properties values variables 
set theory order logic details available 
brevity elaborate 
agents smart agent framework attribute represents perceivable feature agent environment represented predicate negation 
particular state environment described set attributes goal represents situations agent wishes bring motivations desires preferences affect outcome reasoning intended satisfy agent goals actions discrete events change state environment performed 
purposes formally describe attributes environmental states goals actions 
details remaining elements needed simply consider sets 
addition entity described non empty set attributes representing permanent features set goals wants bring set capabilities able perform set motivations representing preferences 
agents entities set goals empty autonomous agents agents non empty sets motivations 
omitting irrelevant details formalise follows 
norms agent may access certain norms represented data structures relating social rules 
may common agents mutually understood social law available 
norms mechanisms society order influence behaviour agents 
norms created different sources varying built norms simple agreements agents complex legal systems 
may persist different periods time example agent dies long agent remains society norms issued just short period time normative goals satisfied 
different aspects characterizing 
norms prescribed complied set addressee agents order benefit set agents possibly empty 
specify ought done consequently include normative goals satisfied addressees 
normative goals directly intended times role inhibit specific goals case prohibitions 
second norms applicable activation depends context agents situated may exceptions agents obliged comply norm 
cases norms suggest existence set sanctions punishments imposed agents satisfy normative goals set rewards received agents 
punishment rewards represented goals satisfied 
general structure norm formalised follows 
note specify normative goals set allow possibility multiple goals norm recognise typically singleton set 
norms divided eliminating possibility having categories types obligations prohibitions social commitments social codes 
roughly say obligations prohibitions norms adopted agent member society social commitments norms derived agreements negotiations agents social codes norms motivated feelings love friendship social conformity 
purpose discuss different categories norms consequently remainder term norm umbrella term cover type norm 
argue share structure 
important consideration point understand prohibitions norms normative goals avoided addressee agents 
normative agents normative agent autonomous agent behaviour shaped obligations comply prohibitions limit kind goals pursue social commitments created social life social codes may carry punishments fulfillment means identify part community 
permitted forbidden actions useful observe norms normative goals ought achieved actions lead satisfaction goals 
talk actions permitted forbidden norm follows 
situation state norm activated results action benefit achievement associated normative goal action permitted respective norm 
example normative goal norm taxes paid action paying taxes permitted action changes agent situation having taxes situation taxes paid 
analogy define forbidden actions actions leading situation contradicts hinders normative goal 
example action illegal parking forbidden action norm normative goal avoid parking front hospital entrance 
general trivial observe results action benefit hinder achievement normative goals 
example spend money try pay taxes obvious spending money may hinder normative goal paying taxes 
avoid drilling intricate details important somewhat secondary concern relation focus associations situation states benefit hinder goals taken granted formalised follows 
define relations hold action norm permit forbid action follows 
words action applied context norm results action benefit normative goals action permitted action forbidden

predicates describe respectively structure enforcement reward legislation norms 
notice enforcement norm norm enforce norm may corresponding enforcement norm means society legally entitled punish agent fulfill norm 
normative roles defining normative multi agent system way allows identification different roles agents 
roles depend kind norms agents responsible

agent defender directly responsible applying punishments giving rewards 
main responsibility police agents monitor compliance norms

addressee agents directly responsible achievement normative goals 
beneficiaries agents goals benefited normative goal satisfied 
normative roles agents mutually exclusive 
fact agents able normative role time depending kind norm considered 
example social commitment beneficiary agent police consequently encourage fulfillment norm defender apply sanctions give rewards agreed past 
office manager impose norms defender entitled punish employees 
complex society elaborate normative roles cases authorities judges police complex structure control generally named government legal norms directed control rest society

complementary relationships identified follows 
say agent responsibility rewarding agent agent defender norm second agent fulfilled 
addition agent right rewarded defender norm agent complied 
unfulfilled norm relations contrast norm unfulfilled events take place kinds relationships hold
