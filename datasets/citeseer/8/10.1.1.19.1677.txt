situation theory information retrieval model information stored relayed different forms including texts images audio video 
forms referred documents 
cases ir system rate entire information content document due factors efficiency complexity 
ir system handles manipulable representation document information content 
internal representation aims give faithfully possible document information content 
conventional text ir systems creation internal representation referred indexing 
user need information submits query ir system expresses information need 
query evaluated system transformed internal representation manageable system 
transformation query involves process similar represent document information content 
system compares query representation document representations determines matched computational techniques document representations may satisfy user request 
retrieved documents 
comparison representation processes documents queries additional semantic knowledge generally stored thesaurus 
example synonymous relationships document indexed item indexed eventually implicitly synonyms item stored thesaurus 
depending efficient adequate system retrieved documents correspond relevant documents satisfy original information need 
positive correspondence retrieved relevant documents main objective ir system ir system retrieve relevant documents possible relevant documents 
logical ir model supposed way represent information content document sentence information need phrased query sentence truth mean query sentence inferred document sentence 
put way information captured sufficient infer information represented ir world viewed document satisfying relevant query 
logic accurate model information flow principal concerns ir 
oxford english dictionary logic defined branch philosophy treats form thinking general especially inference scientific method 
logic formalization way information everyday life think infer conclude acquire knowledge decisions forth 
sense logic undertakes model information flow 
discussed preponderance flow information ir 
example textual ir systems flow allows read recognition letters words sentences flow allows understand reading semantics flow allows respect knowledge subject derive additional information read pragmatics 
logic modelling ir authors proposed interesting frameworks authors adopted truth logic corresponds second view logic oxford english dictionary frege logic formal system symbolic techniques mathematical methods establish truth values physical sciences language philosophical argument 
domains relate information artificial intelligence databases linguistics philosophy information represented structure calculus built concept truth 
hand line forth advance logic model ir logic information flow 
reason chosen theory situation theory primarily concerned representation information flow 
section show appropriateness situation theory model ir 
base discussion dretske provides comprehensive dissertation role information flow 
philosophy development situation theory conforms points expressed dretske 
relevant ir discussed section representations situation theory ontology emphasized 
term relevance contexts respect user correct ir world respect system indicating satisfaction 
main concepts situation theory summarized signal dretske explains information knowledge source communicated signal receiver 
ir source document receiver anybody observing document reading text listening observing image 
signals means information source delivered receiver 
example document text signal mixture reader vision capability understanding information read general knowledge subject 
signal indexing process delivers representation information content document 
dretske defines source structure information content situation primary concern 
situation information item 
signal carries information contains expressed written situation theory 
signal carries carries additional information situation situations owing exact fact supports 
information said nested fact supports 
dretske notes information encoded forms signal carries information digital form information nested information carried signal signal carries information analog form 
perception amount information contained documents usually large 
compare physical document information content sensory experience embodies great variety details 
dretske perception sensory experience process information delivered cognitive agent selective 
identified signal carries information source coded analog form 
information extracted signal corresponding recognition classification identification occurred 
successful conversion information appropriate digital form constitutes essence cognitive activity 
situation theory situations objects perception 
provide information signals carry analog form 
perception process embodies information variety details carried total cognitive agent require immense storage retrieval capabilities 
information extracted exploited cognitive agent 
information perception process carries analog form retained 
holds true ir systems 
indexing document give exhaustive description information content document 
information store possible exhaustively determine information content 
perception process determined information carried way carried 
seeing hearing reading different processes information carry information vehicle information delivered 
different concepts involved information delivered information represents 
situation theory concerned situation text image speech

cognition dretske describes cognition conversion information cognitive agent receives analog form digital form 
result usually qualified knowledge respect cognitive agent 
conversion referred dretske involves loss information turns structure greater information content lesser information content 
gained loss sort classification information provided 
indexing process ir compared process 
ir system cognitive agent 
document situation contains information analog form 
information successfully constitutes document representation 
goal minimize loss information involved conversion time obtaining small document representation storage capacity retrieval speed 
outcome cognition process partial representation information carried source document ir 
researchers refer situation partial object contain vast amount information part 
item information depends properties attached cognitive agent ffl capability perception 
example human robot perceive information level 
robot identify entities human vice versa 
ffl focus attention cognitive agents constructed fulfill task 
example color wall may interest moving device purpose avoid wall 
essence situation theory capture facts case frameworks truth classical logic default theory modal logic 
representation information item assessed belong belong document assessment truth value 
unreasonable information items connection whatsoever information content document 
document identified situation document contains information written text contained images 
text documents digital information information explicit indexing process 
information strongly dependent properties indexer cognitive agent 
information vs meaning dretske claims information meaning different concepts 
reason assume information signal carries identical meaning 
information contained signal exceeds meaning 
example statement keith home means keith home 
mean keith home keith home implies keith home 
signal carries keith home carries keith home 
information follows flow information springs meaning attached statement 
difference information meaning highlighted quote information commodity yielding knowledge information signal carries learn 
ir understanding meaning attached sentences document important insufficient determining information content document 
thorough representation document information content needs appropriate capturing flow information 
frameworks montague semantics appropriate theories meaning situation theory theory information 
flow information indexing process ir information constitutes document initial representation exhaustive description information content document 
representation customarily depicts explicit information content document determined meaning sentences document 
additional information identified part document information content 
additional information constitutes implicit information content document 
information carried analog form remain extracted indexing process 
carried digital form part known information content document 
existence information due flow information arises explicit information content document 
may help understanding notion flow information consider examples 
situation showing smoke contains information fire constraint smoke usually means fire 
object contains information object rectangle relative analytic constraint 
document pascal contains information programming languages 
see flow information characterizes information containment generally defined information object contains carries object 
purpose ir system provide information query query representation information need ir system attempts satisfy 
determining relevance consists computing information contained object document query 
problem identification flow information document object query object 
information containment usually described informative relationships items information object affected information containment 
relationship information items 
flow information relationship indicates object contains information item contains carries information second object contains information item situation theory constraints model relationships defined types 
oe types constitute constraint oe 
application constraint situation possible oe informs existence situation fact oe carries information 
flow information circulates situations nature flow defined constraint oe 
document object query object existence flow circulates means document relevant query 
nature flow determined constraints ir model thesaural semantic relationships holland netherlands synonymous pragmatic relationships systematic relationship people attach wine france complex relationships handled artificial intelligence 
uncertain flow information flow information uncertain 
example consider synonymous relationship terms basis flow 
synonymous terms different meanings certain contexts 
known sense term refers context flow relates term uncertain 
relationship appropriate respect context 
situation theory uncertain flows come fact constraints hold 
constraints hold called conditional 
conditional constraint written oe highlights fact constraint oe holds situation background conditions captured satisfied situation ffl situation satisfies background conditions constraint certain resulting flow 
ffl background conditions satisfied constraint 
ffl known background conditions satisfied situation constraint uncertain resulting flow uncertain 
background conditions ir model acknowledges important fact information seen dependent context 
example background conditions represent context respect polysemic words 
consider word bank document dealing finance 
inference respect word relate money bank context river bank 
background conditions particularly complex identify 
day reasoning people background conditions aware 
people asked express 
imply non existence background conditions 
devlin points background conditions concern constraint fails 
similar problems arise ir 
take example synonym constraint 
term referred constraint polysemic disambiguation necessary ensure constraint 
ir disambiguation unfortunately successful possible 
implies constraint uncertain leading uncertain flow 
uncertain flow relevant document 
ir usually insufficient say document relevant query knowing extent relevance mandatory uncertainty engendered uncertain flow basis numerical formulation relevance 
achieved mapping theory uncertainty top situation theory 
situation theory model ir uncertain nature flow information qualitatively captured initially studied 
natural language processing situation theory provides additional benefit develop framework natural language processing 
framework called situation semantics 
models utterance sentence entities type represents information content sentence situation sentence describes situation sentence uttered 
components sentence defined terms types entities combined form entities sentence
