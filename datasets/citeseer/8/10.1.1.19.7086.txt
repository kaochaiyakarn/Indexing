type distributed content unusual line hypertext 
considering today video capturing methods may early anticipate extensive type distributed video content 
may popular video content created video editing tools re existing video distributed sources 
distributed object video paradigm video editors need handle new challenges related synchronization particularly line real time editing systems 
earlier spatio temporal composition multimedia streams addressed issues higher granularity video clip audio sequence text images arbitrarily shaped video object level 
new research object level editing support real time interactivity required 

new media applications education printed media dominated education making 
dominance arose perverse error 
came largely experience captured writing reproduced printing effectively searchable accessible diverse persons locations extended times random access 
historically privileged written resources making experience recorded far easily knowledge formal education generation 
search modalities new media collections described endow visual auditory resources sort demand long enjoyed printed resources 
plan introduce search modalities classrooms help teachers students apply course 
search tools show variety educational applications 
way educators developed numerous strategies teach writing develop ways modalities teach seeing

developing skill finding information intellectual resources important school curriculum goal students going higher education secondary objective general education 
information society cultural assets civilization increasingly available online person place time ability select retrieve resources pertinent purposes increasingly important educational objective 
furthermore stock knowledge available demand increasingly multimedia stock content image search retrieval grows importance 
consequently plan concentrate considerable effort developing educational uses search tools

concluding remarks generation new media applications start enabling people audio visual resources flexible reflective ways 
long term cultural implications developments significant 
move vigorously realization need overcome key technical barriers inability existing sensors capture full view complete structure precise identity objects inability directly extract information content existing techniques multimedia representation retrieval difficulty providing easy techniques analyzing presenting interacting massive amounts information lack integration existing networking models ip atm wireless capable fulfilling new media application requirements including ease service creation resource allocation quality service mobility 
addition need bring generation new media applications everyday wide range situations education
