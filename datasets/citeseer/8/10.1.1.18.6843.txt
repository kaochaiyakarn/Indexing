explored retrieval phoneme grams 
phonemes addresses vocabulary problem grams allows approximate matching inaccurate phoneme transcriptions 
experiments explored utility word boundary information word elimination query expansion varying length phoneme sequences matched various combinations grams different lengths 
word recognition match queries speech phoneme representation words permitting test recognition matching process crucial retrieval performance 
experiments show deterioration effectiveness particular form matching vital sequence phonemes correct 
phone sequences recognised directly higher error rates words important select matching approach 
varying gram length trades precision recall combination grams different lengths particular grams grams improve retrieval 
phoneme retrieval effective word retrieval sufficient situations word retrieval impractical undesirable 
information retrieval techniques widely text databases identify documents relevant free text queries

experiments conducted part text retrieval conference trec sponsored nist darpa encourage research information retrieval 
trec spoken document retrieval sdr experiments word approaches consistently outperformed phoneme approaches 
reasons phonemes 
word recognition wbr assumptions recognition process 
recogniser uses large vocabulary containing words recognised 
trec sdr collection hours spoken documents contain unique words 
obtaining recognition performance requires vocabulary size 
second spoken documents consistent language model 
model determines recognition language structure embodying certain assumptions exactly word precede word 
model predict language higher recognition performance achieved 
computational resources required perform wbr available 
consider situation assumptions 
recognition process small hand held device computational resources limited large vocabulary may possible 
furthermore resources required build language model may available small language model spoken documents may consistent limiting usefulness 
consider basic recognition system phoneme recogniser run small processor 
due simplicity suffers poor recognition performance compared wbr approach 
second consider spoken document collection containing significantly high proportion vocabulary oov words adversely affect retrieval mis recognised 
example spoken collection names places 
textual retrieval perspective words due rarity document collection usually assist identification relevant documents 
wbr system having seen sufficient examples words training process may incorrectly recognise words
