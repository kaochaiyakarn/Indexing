periodic vehicle routing problem problem designing set delivery routes day planning period customers may receive deliveries day period 
problem typically arises distribution industries grocery industry beverage industry 
general customers industries low volume daily product usages 
economical distributors deliver products customers daily basis 
customers daily demands aggregated larger quantities delivered periodically week twice week 
frequent customers receive deliveries depend product usages storage spaces preferences 
multiple product periodic vehicle routing problem multiple depot environment considered 
typically distributor owns distribution centers region specify territory depot depot operate independently 
customers may located approximately equi distant distribution centers 
cases may beneficial incorporate choice distribution center suitable decision variable development model model select distribution center deliveries assign customer particular distribution center 
classical vehicle routing problem periodic vehicle routing problem vehicle allowed delivery trip day 
real world applications vehicle finishes trip short time vehicle dispatcher may consider assigning trip fully utilize resources 
multiple trips vehicle single day considered
