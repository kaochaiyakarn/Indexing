meta controller able decide appropriate engage trade negotiation appropriate trade negotiation negotiation decision variables subject trade offs current time set various parameters trade algorithm order optimise agent performance 
secondly explore opportunities agent learn information negotiation opponent agents come higher quality agreements efficient manner 
particular learning information opponent preferences relative weightings lead better outcomes
