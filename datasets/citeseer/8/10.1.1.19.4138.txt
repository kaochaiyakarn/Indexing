commercial wide network deployment mobile agent systems possible satisfying security architecture 
outlines design secure mobile agent architecture 
mobile agents mobile agent platforms exposed various security threats 
attacks mobile agents platforms usually come main forms active passive 
passive attacks try collect data authorization eavesdropping active attacks try modify system cause different behavior system
