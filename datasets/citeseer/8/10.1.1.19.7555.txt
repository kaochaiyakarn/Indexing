preliminaries preliminary definitions formal treatment term objective 
objective measure commonly thought fitness function takes genotype assigns unique value 
model employs ranking functions absolute fitness functions establish objectivity means regard ranking 
definition ranking function objective population vectors establishes ordering individuals infinite population regardless proportions really redefinition objectivity note objective ranking function trivially exists objective fitness measure simply order genotypes rank assign rank fitness 
definition ranking function population vectors establishes ordering individuals infinite population non zero proportions objective function existentially objective 
note crucial difference definitions 
ranking function mapped absolute fitness function definition implies objective fitness individual invariant population context including populations contain individual 
truly objective fitness measure allows directly compare results techniques chart fitness progresses course run 
second definition imply guarantees individuals existing population ranked way relative 
evolutionary system uses non parametric selection procedure second definition sufficient guarantee individuals subjective fitness measure selected exact way selected objective ranking function coevolutionary procedure guaranteed follow trajectory traditional evolutionary procedure uses nonparametric selection
