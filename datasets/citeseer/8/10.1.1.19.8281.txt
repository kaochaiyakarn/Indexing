concretely define follows 
definition defined points constraint time series indicating time range dynamic variable value range assuming 
multiple timeboxes drawn specify conjunctive queries 
data sets match constraints implied timeboxes order included result set 
creation timeboxes straightforward user simply clicks desired starting point drags pointer desired location opposite corner 
identical mechanism creating rectangles widely drawing programs operation familiar users
