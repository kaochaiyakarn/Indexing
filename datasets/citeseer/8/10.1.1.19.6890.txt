derivative markets involve buying selling forward contracts futures binding obligations options rights contract purchase sale units pre specified price date review simple types derivatives see 
derivative markets provide mechanisms spreading risk intertemporal arbitrage 
probable market organisations fewer simplifying constraints range possible actions available traders increases complex decision adaptation mechanisms required
