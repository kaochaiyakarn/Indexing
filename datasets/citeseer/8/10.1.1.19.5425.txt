particular consider dsdv dsr aodv ad hoc routing protocols tcp tahoe reno new reno sack versions 
ad hoc routing protocols classified reactive proactive 
reactive routing protocols find routes needed proactive ones try maintain valid routes routing tables 
easily seen important tradeoff exists terms performance power consumption 
general reactive protocols tend consume power expense having valid information routing tables 
hand proactive protocols incur higher overhead keep routing tables date consuming energy 
story having valid routes time translate having send fewer packets complete required transactions 
routing protocols developed ad hoc networks 
destination sequenced distance vector dsdv protocol introduced 
dsdv distance vector routing protocol requires node advertise neighbors routing table including hop information reach destinations network 
dsdv sends updates periodically proactive event link change sequence numbers order information 
dynamic source routing dsr reactive routing protocol source routing packets leave source node complete route headers 
dsr relies flooding route discovery mechanism find appropriate routes route maintenance mechanism know existing routes 
main advantage dsr dsdv intermediate nodes don need maintain routing tables 
dsr doesn need send routing table updates periodically need implement controlled flooding mechanism 
temporally ordered routing algorithm tora uses controlled flooding mechanism discover multiple routes source destination demand basis 
order reduce overhead tora utilizes sub optimal paths triggering new flooding procedure 
ad hoc demand distance vector aodv source routing protocol dsdv dsr 
utilizes sequence numbers dsdv demand route discovery maintenance mechanisms dsr 
thorough performance evaluation dsr dsdv aodv tora analyzing percentage packets received routing overhead relation pause time time mobile user moving new direction 
analyze routing protocols different values pause times continuous movement motion 
main related study dsr protocol movement provides highest percentage packets delivered lowest routing overhead 
results expected dsr source routing protocol doesn need routing updates nodes don move connections don break 
addition source routing effective valid route available time 
authors show tora worst performing routing protocol terms overhead pause times considered percentage packets delivered medium large pause times 
main reasons didn include tora performance evaluations 
initial design tcp suffered modifications caused different versions appear 
version tcp tahoe introduced 
tcp tahoe known slow start congestion avoidance fast retransmit mechanisms included 
new mechanisms improve tcp performance responsible stability internet 
meant probe network slowly reduce sending rate drastically event congestion 
fast retransmit mechanism allows retransmission missing packet faster activated reception duplicate tcp segment 
tcp reno includes main additions fast recovery mechanism window inflation deflation mechanism 
fast recovery mechanism activated fast retransmit doesn reduce congestion window half current value 
reception duplicate indication network heavily congested tcp throughput improved reducing congestion window drastically 
inflation deflation mechanism allows tcp continue sending new segments fast retransmit fast recovery phase avoiding timeouts 
tcp new reno introduced avoid timeouts case multiple segments lost window staying fast retransmit fast recovery phase segments correctly received 
tcp sack segments lost current window faster tcp newreno having specific information packets flight ones correctly received
