chat conversation structured 
chat continuous medium users entering leaving chat room 
furthermore chat room may users logged may participating 
users involved participate discussion users 
conversations simultaneously place users single participant may involved multiple conversations 
extremely chaotic environment glance lack consistent structure 
chat conversations interlaced multiple postings extracting authors content single cohesive units input ssb daunting task 
furthermore research observed numerous categories chat 
factors number participants topic chat familiarity users lead radically different conversation styles 
sampled session acquaintances discussing common topic example conversation flow tends informal little attention grammar 
session instance help session discussion medium focused topic users don know conversation focused formal larger vocabulary 
various chat specific issues considered 
chat conversation misspelled words chat specific terms 
emotion icons extensively chat conversations 
decoding terms crucial conversation domain hold semantic importance 
current approach develop methodology formatting chat conversational data collection items ssb input 
item consists postings relevant single topic users participated topic 
framework names screen names posters identify authors items identify content 
coauthorship relationship defined users content postings 
separate content author clusters created occurrence semantic features screen names noun phrases 
approach current goal develop methodology mapping chat conversation information input ssb 
mapping names isn difficult task screen names identifying authors chat conversation employ database names compiled united states census means accurately identifying names conversation 
difficult task develop technique identifying extracting items topics chat room conversation 
attempts settling current approach 
follows briefly discuss initial attempts describe current approach 
method chronological definition items initial premise point time chat conversation focused topic 
heuristically determined time period conversation separated segments individual document 
early development premise proved flawed manual study actual chat conversations noticed conversation isn contiguous expected fluctuates rapidly 
attempting time interval identification item result defined topically distinct items 
method topic second approach involved utilization marti hearst text tiling algorithm locate topic boundaries expository text 
texttiling algorithm report topic segment boundaries segment classified item consisting group authors 
result acceptable ssb input format 
motivation approach texttiling algorithm designed separate expository text paragraphs process paragraph conversation topic 
unfortunately algorithm designed structured data research articles organized corpuses 
chat multiple topics occur set contiguous postings 
resulted texttiling algorithm returning unpredictable results topics fragmented original data 
conversational flow identified threads analyses issues led classify topics chat conversation threads 
chat conversation chat medium flows intertwined multiple threads conversation 
instant multiple conversations simultaneously occurring result multiple threads 
participants chat conversations trouble identifying speakers remembering said 
shown particular room channel multiple conversations threads going time single user participates multiple threads time 
unraveling threads topic identification chat structure threads approach adapted process extracting threads storing thread conversation document 
employed choi algorithm order accurately represent single set postings single author corresponding single topic 
method frequency counts common words order create vectors segment similarity segments cosine measure 
essentially method involves determining arc weights relationships words segment similar 
goal organizing data manner effectively unwind threads classify thread separate item concerning particular topic 
planned employ technique determine authors belonged content threads 
unfortunately results indicated separating contents groups information lost 
due effects noted section fact single authors simultaneously participate multiple conversations 
furthermore chat conversations lacked organization richness unique words method relies 
method adaptive techniques threaded conversation identifying thread starts initial methods failed primarily designed corpuses regular semantic structure 
discovery chat conversation modeled threads lead new technique topic identification 
revised methodology starts individual threads conversation classifying thread starts topic non thread starts 
goal process non thread start attach appropriate thread start 
follows discuss techniques identifying thread starts validation approach experimental results
