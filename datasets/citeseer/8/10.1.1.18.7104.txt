induced vocal expression 
studies simulated vocal expressions studies acoustic features manipulated order evoke different reactions experimental subjects resynthesized vocal expressions 
classic experimental design emotion studies laboratory experienced speakers act specific state arousal glad angry sad order keep things equal carrier sentence test items 
experimental setting compared phonetic phonological experiments cf 
experiments generally performance reported subjects find intended emotions high reliability automatic classifiers yield high recognition rates
