due complexity human motion problem challenging ongoing topic research 
surface drawback method may appear need choose particular frequency band matching step 
choice difficult fact results highly dependent choice 
low frequency band provides information motion provide results 
resulting animations vary depending frequency band chosen slightly different regions data matched quite similar 
high band chosen resulting animation uncoordinated look motion accurately represented matching step 
similarly drawback method may appear animator specify degrees freedom matching angles 
spent time character quite easy practice specify information 
simplistic approach simply degrees freedom animator sketched motion keyframes 
cases fewer degrees freedom specified equally results obtained 
motion variation walking results pleasing fewer angles chosen matching angles 
fact fascinating correlated motions human body 
data angles hip knee angles leg synthesize rest body 
motion variation dancing better include angles ensure choices matching 
fewer joints matching case resulting paths may results may appear somewhat uncoordinated full body 
fact goal project create completely automatic method give animator tool incorporating information motion capture data creations 
different choices matching angles yield different results provide animator different possibilities final animation 
source different motions comes examining different paths best matches 
animator option looking possibilities making artistic decision best
