content image query methods may retrieve images visual contents 
systems visual features texture color shape structure 
example texture describe coarseness contrast roughness presence absence directionality image 
method may amounts different colors image 
color amounts describe entire color content image describe color amounts local regions image 
methods separately combined calculating similarity measures content image query 
different search engines various methods support alternate combinations 
different algorithms calculating similarity measures distances 

query interface component metaseek currently supports target search engines visualseek webseek qbic virage 
current version metaseek user interface allows browsing random images retrieved remote search engines 
user select method querying color texture 
methods selected individually combined 
popular search technique image search engines search keywords 
kind search search engines querying documents images 
image search visual content usually returns ranked list images highest similarity query input example image visual sketch 
keyword search may match images particular subjects nature people narrow search scope 
metaseek allows search example images urls keyword text 
search engines support options

query dispatching component metaseek queries search engines support method query selected user color texture second high past performance scores 
performance scores calculated time query user feedback 
calculation performance scores explained section 
metaseek keeps track performance scores search engines respect query image 
performance scores indexed database select target search engines new query 
metaseek stores visual feature vector queried image case queried image database 
case user issues new query set old queries similar feature vectors new query 
queried images performance scores select search engines new query 
approach basically finds best query examples past follows route selecting remote search engines done past queries 
query interface metaseek query selecting specifying url address image metaseek searches database specified image find best search options previous queries image 
search option query method specific search engine 
example query visualseek search engine texture considered search option 
image database best search options decided previous queries similar images 
similar images selected database comparing locally calculated feature vectors color texture 
tamura algorithm computing texture feature vectors 
color feature vectors calculated color histogram algorithm 
distance feature vectors calculated euclidean distance 
feature vectors added database queries 
note feature vectors necessary 
performance monitoring search engine recommendation framework general accommodate different feature vectors 
database monitoring performance different search options contains information image name includes complete url address image located local remote site 
locally calculated feature vectors color texture 
list performance scores possible search options 
example na na na na 
descending order integers correspond scores integers proceeded signs correspond indices search options 
example indices may correspond search options shown table 
index option qbic texture qbic color percentages qbic color layout visualseek color percentages visualseek color layout visualseek texture virage color virage composition virage texture table metaseek indexing example seen example indices sorted scores 
score na means specific query option corresponding index available search engine making query 
search engines support search url address image outside database queried image database selected 
images outside databases scores corresponding query options relate search engines set na 

display component results retrieved individual search engine need merged displayed user 
results ranked order closest farthest match 
metaseek performs additional ranking returned images query images performance scores 
result images returned query option interleaved displaying user 
performance scores determine order displayed images number images interleaved group query results 
example images returned query options performance scores metaseek continue display images query option having score image query option score returned images displayed user 
metaseek cleaning removing duplicates necessary 
specific merging algorithm meant replace ranking algorithms remote search engine 
cope heterogeneity different algorithms different search engines 
consistent distance metrics text search engines visual search engine uses different algorithms metrics 
order evaluate similarities returned images different engines query input common set features computed returned images compared query input 
option costly network images downloaded order feature vectors computed 
selected merging method ignores actual distances images possible image lower similarity measure input query displayed image higher similarity 

performance monitoring dispatching component meta search engine determines query method remote search engine executed 
mentioned earlier decision performance metrics calculated past queries target engine supports specified method query 
performance metric signed integer positive number indicates performance negative number corresponds poor performance 
performance metrics query image modified time user sends query 
visit image increments performance metric search engine returns visited image 
image selected visit performance score remains unchanged 
user specify likes dislikes particular image turn increment decrement performance metric corresponding search engines 
modifications database shown table 
event score visit visit dislike table assigned values performance metrics mentioned earlier metaseek removes duplicate images returned different search options different search engines 
user clicks dislike button image having duplicate metaseek increment decrement performance scores search options returned image duplicates displayed user
