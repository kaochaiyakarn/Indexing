providing additional guarantees 
default scribe provides reliable ordered delivery multicast messages tcp connections nodes multicast tree break 
example nodes multicast tree fail scribe may fail deliver messages may deliver order 
scribe provides simple mechanism allow applications implement stronger reliability guarantees 
applications define upcall methods invoked scribe 
msg invoked scribe node forwards multicast message msg children multicast tree 
method modify msg forwarded 
msg invoked scribe new child added node children tables 
argument join message 
msg invoked scribe node suspects parent faulty 
argument join message sent repair tree 
method modify msg add additional information sent 
example application implement ordered reliable delivery multicast messages defining upcalls follows 
defined root assigns sequence number message multicast messages buffered root node multicast tree 
messages retransmitted multicast tree repaired 
fault handler adds sequence number delivered node join message retransmits buffered messages sequence numbers new child 
ensure reliable delivery messages buffered amount time exceeds maximal time repair multicast tree tcp connection breaks 
tolerate root failures root needs replicated
