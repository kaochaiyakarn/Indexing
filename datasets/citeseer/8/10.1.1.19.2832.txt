mesh approach section describe narada protocol example mesh approach 
narada narada protocol application layer multicast protocols demonstrated feasibility implementing multicast functionality application layer 
narada defines special designated host called rendezvous point rp boot join procedure new member 
fact application layer multicast protocols entity equivalent rp narada initiate join mechanism 
nomenclature denote boot application layer multicast protocols 
mesh construction new member wants join multicast group obtains list group members joined mesh 
information typically obtained rp maintains state members joined multicast group 
new member randomly selects subset members attempts join mesh neighbors members 
join procedure succeeds members accepts new member 
joining mesh new member starts exchanging periodic refresh messages mesh neighbors 
new member joins existing member leaves group mesh group change information propagated mesh members 
member group keeps state members part group 
information periodically refreshed 
distribution state information member members leads relatively high control overhead aggregate control overhead group size 
narada protocol effective multicast group size small 
explicit design choice narada protocol authors traded high control overheads greater robustness recovery member failures specific cases 
described example 
members simultaneously fail mesh partitions parts 
consequence members receiving state refresh messages members vice versa 
member probabilistically probes members stopped receiving refresh messages establish new links repair partition panel 
note recovery require intervention rp works rp fails 
data delivery path members group run routing protocol compute unicast paths pair members mesh 
multicast data delivery path specific member source computed known reverse path forwarding check employed ip multicast protocols dvmrp

yoid directly creates data delivery tree direct control various aspects tree structure degree members choice tree neighbors contrast mesh approach indirect control tree structure quality data delivery tree depends quality mesh 
tree construction protocols tree approach create shared tree member responsible finding appropriate parent tree 
member tree degree bound limits number children tree willing support 
new member starts find new parent querying rp 
rp typically responds list members part multicast group joined tree 
member probes members list find potential parents 
member potential parent conditions hold chosen parent cause loop tree available degree new children 
potential parent list yoid proposes different heuristics find potential parents tree 
protocol describe implements specific example heuristic 
eventually finds potential parents chooses best potential parent respect metric interest parent 
unable find parent eventually declares root shared tree informs rp 
transience tree may get partitioned member tree partition declare root 
case rp merging different trees fragments 
periodically members seeks potential parents better points attachment shared tree 
yoid incorporates loop detection avoidance mechanisms members change parents tree 
mesh construction member shared tree finds members random additional links tree links define mesh 
additional mesh links recovery tree partitions 
host multicast tree protocol application layer multicast protocol uses tree approach similarities yoid protocol 
tree construction yoid members responsible finding parents shared tree 
joining member finds parent heuristic discovers root shared tree querying rp 
starting root level tree tries find member close 
number children degree bound joins child proceeds level tries find potential parent children shown example 
new member probes root degree filled probes find child closest 
available degree proceeds level finds nearest child available degree joins child members maintain information members path root 
periodically member tries find better closer parent tree join process random member root path 
knowing entire root path allows members detect loops 
employs loop detection resolution mechanism loop avoidance 
yoid explicitly create mesh 
member periodically discovers caches information members part tree 
specific case rp unavailable knowledge members recover tree partitions
