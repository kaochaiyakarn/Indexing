page data types items displayed identified dimensional linear data organized sequential manner alphabetical list names program source code textual documents dimensional planar map data covering part area maps newspaper layouts photographs dimensional data volume potentially complex relations molecules human body buildings temporal data start time finish time possible overlaps timescale medical records project management video editing multi dimensional data attributes points dimensional space records relational statistical databases tree collections items linked hierarchically tree structure computer directories business organizations genealogy trees network collections items linked graph structure telecommunication networks world wide web hypermedia structures 
data items mentioned category multiple attributes dimensional object additional attributes color level transparency brightness node item tree additional attributes name creation date modification date 
separation different categories strict temporal data seen instance multi dimensional data 
separation useful orienting choice iv techniques temporal aspect dominant considered data display techniques give central role time timelines visualize personal histories temporal animations show evolution physical phenomena familiar vcr metaphor give better results general techniques assume specific relations multiple attributes 
similar considerations hold pairs data types data type seen specialization tree network dimensional multi dimensional 
general display design options exist mapping described categories visual representation 
example possibility display large tree structure map traditional geometric representation accustomed 
innovative mappings proposed iv 
example second possibility page exploits geometry display hierarchical structures compact way sons node placed cone connects father growth tree corresponding geometry node chosen different cones rotate order take node parents closer view projection shadows highlights presence possibly hidden parts 
third possibility apply graphic distortion technique standard representation large structure achieve contextual allowing user concentrate part current interest losing general context

iv workspace neuroimaging proposed environment allow render helps user interpretation linking contextual information entries database large collection neuroscience information relates brain locations human behavioral functions data sources slices atlas human brain 
techniques visualization multidimensional data concerning clinical examinations illustrated 
example cube technique notion multiple parallel diagrams allows clinician visually examine manipulate data concerning multiple cases different patients purpose recognizing interesting patterns 
clinician choose number patient attributes diagnosis smoking habits drugs 
system displays cube containing number parallel planes plane devoted chosen attributes points plane display individual values attribute specific patients coordinates plane chosen function attribute value function patient name obtaining alphabetical order parameter time examination 
example value smoking habits attribute smoker half patients non smoker half corresponding points plane look separated sets points aligned value coordinate 
graphical connections points adjacent planes drawn way patient case visually represented line connecting individual points referring different planes 
allows visually recognize interesting patterns group patients similar profile result parallel lines 
approach visualization multidimensional data clinical databases interactive tables capable displaying different records attributes highly compressed format fit screen 
user directly manipulate table performing zoom filter operations reacts dynamically rearranging 
example column table correspond patient page rows correspond attribute age sex diagnosis result clinical test 
records displayed extremely compressed form obviously impossible show values attributes detail 
display lines meaningful format system relies visualization criteria neighboring cells identical values combined larger cell table sorted attribute sex corresponding line divided regions size gives indication relative proportion male female patients database ii space display numeric value line substituted small horizontal line indicating relative height showing result clinical test falls range patients highlighting exceptions 
temporal data type particular relevance medical iv 
systems proposed kind data time line browser visualized instant events measurement clinical parameter value intervals duration status patient timeline 
elaborate visualization proposed lifelines system faces problem visualizing patient histories 
lifelines provides compact overview relevant events intervals organized different screen areas devoted different aspect medical record consultations conditions medications user select items interest get details demand lab report perform temporal zoom zoom examined range time causing dynamic rearrangement events intervals displayed 
system focuses visualization interactive exploration temporal abstractions bone marrow toxicity grade medical raw data series measurements platelet counts counts 
users dynamically examine temporal information multiple levels abstraction counts detailed state turn detailed bone marrow toxicity change level granularity years days hours 
system enriches timeline graphical representation adopting visualization especially tailored representing medical therapy plans usual dimensions different possibly overlapping parts plans temporally laid third dimension add graphical elements convey information plan completed suspended aborted 
page graphical elements chosen way resulting visualization resembles running track physician run treatment patient evolves 
interesting problem medical temporal data augment existing standard representations clinicians visualization additional information 
example lowe consider display methods typical monitors propose extensions convey additional information concerning certainty vagueness displayed data color coding give indication different levels certainty means various shades color
