list included cognitive state terms notice wonder emotional state terms nervous boring desire terms hope wish moral evaluation obligation terms ought terrible complete list compiled previous language studies 
linguistic approaches help broaden conception scope representational elements theory mind reasoning traditional concerns relationship language mental representation may apply 
particularly reason believe full enumeration mental state terms parallel breadth concepts represented manipulated reasoning processes 
inherent subjectivity concepts may serve restrict new vocabulary lexicon compared topics discourse 
likewise remarkable creativity evident human language may mislead believe representational distinctions concepts fact functionally synonymous 
linguistic approaches persuasive arguing broader scope theory mind representations cognitive models new investigative methodology concept enumeration useful 
analogy investigative tool previous gordon argued progress different area cognition analogical reasoning basis novel methodology investigation mental representations 
cognitive process analogical reasoning received enormous amount attention theoretical experimental aim understanding people draw analogies different cases working memory 
prevailing explanation notion structural alignment mental representations people cases gentner 
different cases judged strongly analogous portions structured mental representation case mapped structurally identical portions 
strong empirical support structure mapping theory analogical reasoning see gentner markman review presents opportunity structural alignment representations necessary process analogies analysis analogies people naturally reveal sorts representations employ 
previous main claims put forth 
noted particularly interesting commonsense notion strategy relates analogies planning cases 
people readily see analogies planning behaviors exhibited vastly different goal driven domains 
example retreating military force destroys supplies take may viewed analogous publicly releases closely guarded industrial secrets face hostile corporate takeover 
cases say actors strategy commonly recognized name earth policy 
accordance structure mapping theory analogy argued strategies structured mental representations shared analogous planning cases employed 
second claim mental representations strategies necessarily include mental states processes people 
example considered example earth policy case actor loose possession valuable resource advancing enemy enemy gains possession resource advance actor imagines resources useless enemy 
strategic analogies show concepts specifically refer mental processes explicitly represented cognition
