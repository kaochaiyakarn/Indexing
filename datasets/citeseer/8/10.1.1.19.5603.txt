recurrent visual semantics concept recurrent visual semantics rv introduced repetitive appearance elements objects scene visually similar semantically meaningful specific context 
rvs occurs domains including sports video consumer photographs 

rvs consumer photographs rvs consumer photographs occurs levels 
pictures taken moving camera different exposure settings 
example photos trip paris common find photographs eiffel tower 
likewise birthday photographs taken different individuals include similar scenes 
images rvs due bracketing pictures taken different exposure settings change subject composition 
scene scene repeated different images party scene

detection bracketing refers pictures subject different exposure settings modifying camera angle composition 
amateur professional photography technique quite common 
cases color histograms unsuitable capturing differences 
example images identical composition variation exposure aperture shutter speed 
color histograms images considerably different semantic content identical 
example bracketing images composition distinct histograms 
order capture similarities types images edge correlation technique 
image normalized resolution edge map generated 
edge map divided blocks summation local measures correlation blocks results edge correlation measure 
detect bracketing comparing edge correlation measure pair contiguous images roll film threshold 
detection occurs edge correlation images detection threshold 
threshold computed automatically pre determined training set see section 

color composition features image automatically segmented color edges 
images different compositions yield different segmentation results regions obtained segmentation compute image composition 
extract set visual features region image extent roundness aspect ratio orientation location dominant color minmax difference 
features selected represent shape orientation location color texture image components 
image compute weighted average cf features extracted follows cf image regions ai feature value feature set area corresponding region average weighted region area larger regions stronger impact composition 
perform clustering create feature vector concatenates averages features number regions feature color histogram 
number regions important may vary considerably images distinct compositions histogram useful representing image color distribution
