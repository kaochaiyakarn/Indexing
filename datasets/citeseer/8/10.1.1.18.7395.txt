gazetteer consists lists cities organisations days week consists entities names useful indicators typical designators titles gazetteer lists compiled finite state machines match text tokens 
grammar consists hand crafted rules describing patterns match annotations created result 
patterns specified describing specific text string annotations previously attached tokens annotations created gazetteer document format analysis

processing different text types muse named entity recognition system designed process multiple types text robust fashion minimal adaptation 
hard generate kind robustness system sacrificing specificity precision recall 
overcome problem system designed adapted situation set resource switches operate certain linguistic features text 
example information domain text may cause system turn specific set gazetteer lists related domain 
similarly information text format may require different grammar rules order preserve ignore layout text addresses letters emails

adapting resources text type far identified number features different text types require adaptation processing resources

email spoken text requirements emails transcriptions spoken texts may considered way degraded input necessarily conform correct usage english 
particular capitalisation punctuation spelling norms obeyed 
punctuation spelling issues fully tackled 
grammars email spoken texts switch turns entirely lowercase names

religious texts may intuitive religious texts require special treatment tend involve sets names commonly different meaning situations 
example names god jesus christ non religious text real entities religious texts fairly sure represent people switch religious texts turns specific gazetteer lists names people places

mainly due wrongly spelled words spacing errors space words 
text tested core grammar gazetteer precision fell slightly recall dropped couple points 
largely due religious names recognised standard grammar 
scientific books results scientific books slightly lower religious texts person scoring low recall 
largely surnames contextual clues 
marked improvement precision recall text processed standard set resources discussed earlier 
medical emails email texts performed achieving precision recall dates precision organisations fell slightly recall locations due typographical errors 
little difference standard grammar email specific grammar expect difference noticeable texts certain stylistic features address layout
