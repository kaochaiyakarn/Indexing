second problem diagnostic programs physicians want help diagnosis 
diagnosis fun physicians trained medical school improve years practice 
want give fun computer 
significant problem diagnosis small part physicians delivery medicine 
visits physician existing previously diagnosed problem 
challenge physician follow problem respond evolution intelligently 
diagnosis relatively rare event probably accounting physician time 
physicians really need help chronic slowly evolving disease patients seen brief episodes require expert interventions 
era chronic care driving ai medicine research 
problem compounded aging population chronic diseases 
element medicine changed imperatives ai research emergence new economic models funding medicine selby 
traditional model fee service physician performs service gets paid agreed amount 
physicians performs lots services physician money 
new model medical funding standard rate patient paid physician regardless usage services patient 
financial incentives reversed 
physician provides service cost time resources taken pot money represents potential profit 
physicians want treat illness huge incentive deliver cost effective high quality care
