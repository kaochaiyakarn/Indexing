mirrored file implementations disk mirroring probably oldest common alternative file implementation 
disk mirroring increases fault tolerance keeping copies file independent disks 
copy lost due media failure second copy available 
disk mirroring implementations increase read performance reading copies concurrently works particularly workloads heavy read bias 
disk mirroring relatively common large database systems tandem ibm hp companies offer mirroring systems 
striping file implementations file striping file implementation takes advantage storage device parallelism

delayed write file implementations delayed write file implementation trades fault tolerance performance ohta 
unix uses write back cache speed file accesses 
minimize data loss case failure unix exceptions write back discipline 
periodically flushes dirty buffers usually half minute 
second writes critical file system structures maintain important disk invariants 
delayed write file implementation eliminates periodic cache flush writes data asynchronously 
fast loose file system trades reliability speed 
high reliability concern files compiler intermediate files 
ohta designed delayed write file system implementation specifically tmp directory usually contains temporary files 
multiple file implementations multiple implementations help close gap 
way providing mechanism aggressively manage trade offs 
file implementations specialized 
different implementations different amounts storage require different amounts processor time 
different implementations optimized different file sizes different access patterns provide different levels fault tolerance 
design space file implementations large complex tradeoff variables include read write performance reliability space efficiency file access patterns file sizes 
large file servers service heterogeneous workload ranging small word processing files large real time video files single file implementation provide adequately entire range 
file servers need number complementary file implementations working provide better tuned service

section sketch design multiple implementation mechanism vfs examine problems 
vfs overview vfs basic concepts volumes file system switch 
volume disk partition holding files organized tree naming structure 
volumes usually called file systems avoid confusion file system volume 
internal nodes tree structure directories leaves files 
volume mounted making root directory available internal node directory volume mounted 
mounting process boot designating special volume called root mounted boot time 
vfs uses volume construct assign files file implementations 
associates volume single file implementation files volume implementation 
second important concept vfs file system switch 
file system switches route file operations system call handler appropriate file implementation 
switch table pointers functions implement file operations read write 
file file system switch stored file vnode kernel structure holding important information open files 
vfs execute file operation read finds file switch file vnode finds code operation switch 
approach definite object oriented flavor close virtual tables 
switch put file vnode determined volume holding file 
problems vfs vfs problems caused volumes construct vfs inherited unix 
vfs uses volume construct functions 
volumes naming files volume share common root directory 
volumes disk selection files volume stored disk

alternative approach user assign files implementations setting file parameter name desired implementation 
user context means humans application programs 
unfortunately approach separates naming assignment solving problems vfs exposes low level mechanisms user negative consequences 
making user assign files file implementations user friendly 
requires user know costs benefits implementation apply knowledge selecting implementations files 
exposing file implementations user problems associated abstraction violation 
example modification difficult

existing programs reconfigured able new implementation 
gelb examines detail problems exposing file implementations user gelb note problems apply vfs exposes implementations users 
alternative approach completely isolate user assignment files implementations 
assignments transparently system heuristic measurements file size read write bias random sequential bias

file servers multiple device types quota system limits user fixed amount storage space 
users able lots cheap slow media limited amount expensive fast media 
accomplished giving user separate quota media type example user right hundreds megabytes digital audio tape limited tens megabytes disk space 
approach problem 
requires administrator multiplies quotas number media types 
burdens administrator requiring user new quota new media types added 
alternative approach invent currency inside file server rank relative cost space device type single standard measure

traditional quota systems approach requires administrator maintain quota user 
new media added administrator simply assign space price
