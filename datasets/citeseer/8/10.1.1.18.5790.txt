investigating context aware information push vs information pull tourists keith cheverst keith mitchell nigel davies distributed multimedia research group department computing lancaster university lancaster la yr tel fax mail kc km nigel comp lancs ac uk despite interest years area context aware computing number significant gaps understanding hci issues associated systems 
particular issue remains relatively unexplored design apparently conflicting goals changes context time adhering principle predictability 
describe investigations issue alternative designs interactive context aware tourist guide 
design information pull emphasis user decide context aware information 
design information push actual presentation context aware information triggered contextual events changes user location changes opening times attractions 
evaluation alternative designs hope gain better understanding usability implications push vs pull specific domain interactive context aware systems general 

fundamental attributes context aware systems react user input input context user environment 
example classic location aware system utilises location order tailor information user 
inherent problem system designers need carefully balance way system reacts environmental triggers location desire system behave predictable manner adhere principle 
consider example classic interactive aware application location aware visitor guide 
key approaches system employ user changes location 
approach push location aware content user order reflect new location 
approach surprise user timing presentation possibly overwrite content user currently engaged reading 
second approach wait user pull content 
implication approach system leave currently displayed content unchanged despite fact content inconsistent user current location 
implication approach designer needs consider kind user notification mechanism may required order prompt user pull new content 
problem systems react context compounded considers location may dynamically changing contextual trigger may 
example state tourist attraction currently open closed context action taken piece context changes 
guide system research vehicle explore issues 
part exploration utilise field trial studies order investigate study reaction city visitors fundamentally different approaches information push information pull 

background designing technology support tourist exploration city needs recognise primary aim assist visitor experiencing real city 
technology consume user attention 
initial evaluation guide system documented revealed visitors generally enjoyed system explore city focus attention interacting system 
weaknesses initial system subsequent evaluation consider presentation dynamic information changes opening times communicated user appropriate way 
guide pull approach original guide system considered approach managing presentation context aware information 
detail approach ostensibly information pull user initiates presentation context aware information example tapping information button 
pull approach adopted number reasons 
firstly approach safest way prevent visitors spending time focussed guide display poised waiting new information appear 
secondly approach match kind interaction takes place guidebook task exploring learning city 
case visitor retrieves pulls information attraction turning appropriate page guide 
effect system context simplify retrieval task visitor current location order pre appropriate page information 
guidebook approach problems considers handling dynamic information user expects information remain constant 
pull approach fitted standard web browsing metaphor interaction model 
order adhere metaphor refresh button incorporated system gui 
roaming new area users required press button order cause system display information new location 
field trial revealed visitors unsure button pressed 
addition system guidebook tour guide mode supported 
mode operation system guide visitor structured tour presenting visitor series instructions assisting navigate current attraction attraction tour 
visitor arrived attraction tour system demonstrate proactive behaviour 
system effectively fallback guidebook mode require user tap information button order retrieve information pertaining current location 
real exception original system pull approach incorporation visual notification window attempt notify user current location shown 
visual notification window 
cell approach sensing location meant accuracy information approximate limited utility visitor 
analysis analysing role information pull original system identified key points 
asynchronous nature information pull meant information currently displayed user inconsistent current context 
example information currently displayed guide unit screen states user standing castle visitor moved castle information effectively inconsistent current context location 
furthermore change context may relate context location change opening time attraction 
communicating context changes investigated original version system clearly raise interesting issues demand investigation 
stimulus cause presentation new information occur comes directly user user focussed system new content 
consequently user current task enjoying view interrupted disturbed presentation context aware information 
clearly tourists choose follow tour guides effectively push albeit verbally information user current location 
shortcoming original system approach explored 
particular important explore usability issues associated information push vs information pull additional infrastructure requirements required supporting information push 
example extent cell location granularity incorporated guide suitable providing triggers sufficiently accurate act stimuli information push 

exploring information push order investigate usability issues associated information push developed push version guide system 
version evaluated period field trial study tourists tend visit lancaster summer months 
particular aim investigate extent possible benefits information push greater reduced effort retrieving information compare negative aspects interruption reduction user control forth 
implications key implications strict information push route pushing new content user content user currently engaged reading may overwritten 
number possible ways dealing problem 
approach simply allow user back button order retrieve previous displayed information 
imagine visitor finding mechanism somewhat frustrating 
approach implemented involves hold feature 
feature enables user force currently displayed remain screen despite changes context may occur 
order alert user fact context changed incorporated new awareness icon gui form waving flag see 
alerting user new information awaiting presentation 
animated icon servers inform user pressing update button new content displayed reflects changed context 
implication approach relates appropriateness alerting visitor change context 
detail need consider change context sufficient relevance visitor warrant attention 
example castle visitor tour closing early may appropriate user aware change 
visitor expressed interest historic attractions personal preferences notification justified 

interesting conflict faces designers interactive mobile contextaware systems 
conflict results aim tailor adapt presentation information current context desire build system adheres principle 
detail designer needs consider importance maintaining consistency user view environment view environment reported system actual state environment 
order explore conflict conducting field trial study evaluate subsequently compare versions guide system ostensibly information pull information push 
addition initial field trial study study explore dynamic changes environment user 
intended results evaluation workshop final
