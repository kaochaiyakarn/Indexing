usage patterns discovered web usage mining effective capturing item item user user relationships similarities level user sessions 
benefit deeper domain knowledge patterns provide little insight underlying reasons items users grouped 
lead number important shortcomings personalization systems web usage mining collaborative filtering 
example new item added web site pages associated item part discovered patterns pages recommended 
keyword content filtering approaches enhance effectiveness collaborative filtering systems focusing content similarity items pages 
approaches incapable capturing complex relationships deeper semantic level different types attributes associated structured objects 
represents progress creating general framework domain ontologies automatically characterize usage profiles containing set structured web objects 
motivation framework context web personalization going page item level constructs full semantic power underlying ontology 
problem statement goal web usage mining capture model behavioral patterns profiles users interacting web site 
discovered patterns usually represented collections pages frequently accessed groups users common needs interests 
patterns better understand behavioral characteristics visitor user segments improve organization structure site create personalized experience visitors providing dynamic recommendations 
conceptual level may different kinds objects site accessible users 
physical level objects may represented web pages 
example consider site containing information movies 
site may contain pages related movies actors appearing movies directors studios conceptually entities represents different type semantic object 
visit site user may access objects session 
session web usage data variety mining techniques discover patterns including clustering association rule sequential pattern discovery 
example clustering user sessions may result discovery similar sessions pages commonly accessed sessions 
order find aggregate representation user interests captured cluster derive cluster centroid containing set vector pages common cluster elements 
called aggregate representations session clusters aggregate usage profiles profiles web personalization 
specifically user session dimensional vector space pages pn pi weight session associated page pi 
weights binary representing existence non existence page access session value representing user interest page page stay time 
applying data mining techniques clustering space may result set cl cl cl clk session clusters cli subset set sessions 
session cluster cl construct usage profile set pageview weight pairs computing centroid cl weight weight significance weight weight page usage profile weight cl weight page session cl threshold focus pages cluster appear sufficient number sessions cluster 
profile turn represented vector original dimensional space 
aggregate representation common usage patterns sets vectors pages usage profiles quite useful personalization collaborative filtering new user accessed set pages pu far measure similarity pu discovered profiles recommend user pages matching profiles accessed user 
discussion focused clustering primary data mining technique discovery usage profiles noted variety techniques 
example frequent itemsets discovered part association rule mining usage data lead sets items pages representing usage profiles :10.1.1.40.6757
problem approach profiles capture common usage patterns page level 
reflect underlying reasons group users represented profile interested accessed pages 
lead number important shortcomings personalization systems web usage mining collaborative filtering 
example new item added web site pages associated item part discovered patterns due lack sufficient usage level data 
user fits profiles may interested new item underlying domain characteristics item correspond items profiles 
movie site example mentioned consider situation discovered usage profile may contain pages related number movies genre directed director 
standard approach personalization pages appearing profile may recommended user accessed pages profile 
new movie added site similar properties appear profile sufficient number users accessed movie similar movies 
problem coined new item problem collaborative filtering 
common approach resolving problem integrate content characteristics pages usage patterns 
generally approaches keywords extracted content web site index pages content classify pages various content categories 
context personalization approach allow system recommend pages user matching usage profile alternatively content similarity pages pages user visited 
cl keyword approaches incapable capturing complex relationships objects deeper semantic level inherent properties associated objects 
movie site example content filtering approach allow system recommend movies similarities textual descriptions content 
system considerable difficulty recommending example unrelated movies genre having main actors accessed user able recommend different types complex objects underlying properties attributes system able rely characterization user segments objects just keywords deeper semantic level domain ontologies objects 
represents progress creating general framework domain ontologies automatically characterize usage profiles containing set structured web objects 
motivation framework context web personalization going constructs full semantic power underlying ontology 
effort involves tasks 
page web site extract domain level structured objects semantic entities contained page 
task involves automatic extraction classification objects different types classes underlying domain ontologies 
goal create representation usage profile discovered web usage mining process clustering association rule mining simply set pages set structured objects embedded pages 

set structured objects representing usage profile create aggregated representation set pseudo objects characterizing objects different types occurring commonly user sessions

personalization framework utilizing domain knowledge user browsing history 
call aggregate representation current user model 
current user model possible approaches generating personalized recommendations user 
approaches depicted 
approach searches domain ontologies recommend items similar features current user model 
call objects instantiations current user model 
approach essentially generalization keyword content filtering approach rely discovered usage profiles 
approach encounter new item problem advantages collaborative filtering systems considering item item relationships items accessed content similarity 
addition approach requires definition possibly complex similarity distance functions attributes underlying classes ontology 
second method generates recommendations discovered domain level aggregate profiles 
recommendation engine matches current user model discovered usage profiles 
usage profiles matching score greater pre specified threshold considered represent user potential interests 
successful match implies current user shares common interests group users usage profile represents 
recommendation engine matches items domain user potential interests recommend user matching items 
approach complex pure content approach involves matching processes matching current user usage profiles matching item candidates user potential interests 
second approach number advantages 
retains user user relationships captured discovered usage profiles 
secondly contrast standard collaborative filtering provides flexibility matching usage profiles current user model case matching involves comparison features relationships exact item identities 
furthermore items appear usage profiles order recommended fine grained domain relationships considered instantiation process 
example shows approach solve new item problem 
consider real estate web site discussed previous section 
consider real usage profile containing property property property property depicted 
suppose new item property added site usage profiles 
assume property attributes price location chicago size rooms style story furthermore assume user browsed pages related property property 
recommendation engine item level usage profiles property recommended 
recommendation engine recommend property property
