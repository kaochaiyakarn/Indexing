haystack project seeks help users effectively visualize manage information 
support flexibility needed users store navigate information way want haystack provides semi structured data model objects connected arbitrary user specified relations 
flexible generic data model presents opportunities improving information retrieval 
searches information generally involve dialogue user computer 
user starts follows sequence navigation steps issuing query looking results refining search parameters desired information 
user interface help navigation process suggesting useful steps taken specifying particular ways refine query 
describe framework assisted navigation system haystack 
framework architect needs consider user interface needs specify set possible navigation steps outcomes 
haystack user interface takes care presenting steps user letting select 
framework built believe number natural navigation modes object summary 
item navigate items share particular attribute 
collection summary 
collection expand include items similar collection 
refine collection 
collection narrow subset items share common value attribute 
important aspect framework completely agnostic particular metadata system continue unchanged users customize repositories new attributes values created imported 
enables framework refine collection information type documents due dates project attribute may defined system developed available navigation introduced 
contrast current systems english designed data structure known time construction concerned issues determining properties associated information important 

example navigation framework haystack quan able provide navigation interface information provided rdf standard representing semi structured data triples 
general approach works arbitrary data 
example navigation system metadata extracted recipes website com way recipe ingredients expressed properties recipe property name ingredient property values rice egg 
output provided navigation system haystack collection recipes 
collection recipes object summarizer suggests user navigate list objects type collection 
collection summarizer notices current items flour rice ingredients suggests subcollection items having flour rice ingredient 
collections objects pervasively metadata available navigation modes implemented collections 
navigation framework uses collection refiner navigation mode recommend refining recipes dish types ingredients 
goal find metadata entries collection split collection possible orthogonal axes available 
navigation mode works finding metadata associated objects collection grouping metadata suggest possible navigation steps user able get collections members share metadata 

navigation framework power navigation framework arises fact navigation mode intelligent way information available various modes put 
navigation framework initialized uses properties current piece object set various navigation modes 
navigation modes expected analyze current object produce list navigation suggestions framework 
information produced implementation navigation modes includes link titles associated actions resulting selecting links possibly number items selecting link 
navigation framework groups possible navigation actions navigation modes presents information user 
framework allows object properties annotated additional information properties refer numeric quantities dates user interface generated suitable fashion 

results navigation system compared com site run publisher house garden 
resulting application shown advantage looking information dynamically able navigation options collection recipes 
contrast navigation options available website hard wired hierarchy navigation steps recommended collection obtained doing operations advanced search 
navigation system tested data available haystack imported mail collections favorite documents system performed expectations 
users able refine collections document types categories assigned documents case mail users able re fine documents created individual 
system tested external datasets collection information states provided comma separated file rdf version cia world factbook datasets object properties encoded human readable strings marked semantically 
expect interesting results 
navigation system recommended navigating states birds flowers world factbook countries independence day currencies 
cases system able provide helpful support navigation data available semantics 
example having encoded area sq mi marked units square miles area 
developing system automatically conversions learning data system powerful 

navigation system improved learning recommend steps order 
algorithms analyze text content collection documents recommend terms best browsing documents 
similarly algorithms try learn items user want click list items collection
