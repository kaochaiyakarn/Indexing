expanded interest include mining science technology literature 
practical experience identifying suitable data sources working custom commercial tools presenting information form clients find useful 
background gives perspective commenting potential usefulness emerging trend detection etd tools challenges arise trying corporate environment 
objective etd provide automated alert new developments happening specific area interest 
assumed detected trend indication event occurred 
person etd software look data determine underlying development 
development important call judgment depends situation particular information needs person evaluating data 
need aware new developments science technology business critical decision makers levels 
people need better data driven decisions part daily 
need data complete available timely manner 
traditionally people learned majority new developments reading various types text documents getting information read documents 
pace new developments accelerates number documents increases exponentially longer possible individual keep happening manual processes 
clear need new note developed methodology partially automated system section 

survey emerging trend detection textual data mining tools methodologies bring level automation detect trends new developments 
etd tools potential play important role identifying new developments corporate decision makers 
tools help possible look data sources new developments time current manual methods 
better understand capabilities etd tool useful look tool 
broad groups potential users 
group analysts information professionals fulfill information needs 
second individual contributors looking information relevant projects 
third managers need strategic tactical decisions 
analysts information main component jobs 
people projects specified clients 
output project report delivered client decision making process 
analysts trained information retrieval techniques text mining techniques familiar various information sources needed complete project 
able communicate results form clients easily understand 
time learn new tools methodologies expected part job 
etd tool targeted analysts complex 
analysts sufficient training proficient 
analysts tool multiple projects learn capabilities limitations tool able recognize areas application appropriate 
expect sophisticated user interface allow analysts access relevant data sources process underlying text display results meaningful way computer graphics visualization techniques 
visualization scheme draw analysts attention trends allow drill data find developments lead trends 
determination detected trend important complicated fact analysts know clients judge important 
interaction analysts clients critical ensure needs clients met 
typically iterative process analysts learn information clients need clients find information available 
analysis done etd tool ability export information facilitate report generation 
scientists engineers business people want etd tools obtain project specific information need tool easy learn intuitive 
connecting appropriate data sources processing data transparent users 
user group typically limited training tool occasionally 
time learn nuances software 
infor kontostathis mation delivered automatically 
simple graphical user interface easily interpreted graphical visualizations required 
people advantage performing determination newly detected trends important 
etd tool meant management personnel automatically connected appropriate data sources intuitive user interface easy learn provide output consistent format managers comfortable 
extremely sophisticated visualizations difficult interpret require high levels interaction useful environment 
current corporate culture managers time engage cursory training new tools 
means probably able operate etd tool effectively complete analysis 
generally comfortable having analyst assemble information provide executive summary 
summarized information underlying data browser format allow look high level results drill detail find particularly interested 
matter capable etd tool quality output depend quality input data 
etd tools supposed identify new developments data processed tool current 
news services supply types news continuous basis 
currently equivalent services fundamental science technology information 
search variety sources find required information 
sampling frequency extract data news feed needs reflect things change area 
business financial events happen frequently changes technology 
set etd tool collect news data day process look new trends 
developments science technology occur slower pace appropriate blocks week month 
processing information year blocks adequate retrospective look happened acceptable decision making situations 
etd systems customizable meet needs specific clients 
etd algorithms eventually proficient determining happened 
development important depends needs person looking data 
broadly speaking types client profile information obtained 
definition area interest second defines characterized important development area 
traditional alerting systems handle problem setting user profile containing search query run periodic 
survey emerging trend detection textual data mining basis specified data sources 
typically query built error basis information professional client 
iterative process 
newer knowledge management systems training sets determine characteristics documents interest build query 
new document checked target characteristics decision automatically document belongs area interest 
remains seen approach best etd tool 
process take significant amount time client wants information 
problem client areas interest expand change time 
time happens existing profile modified new profile generated 
problem determining significant event area handled interactive systems having decision makers operate tools 
decision makers unable unwilling directly tool analysts interview decision makers obtain basic guidelines 
analysts perform analysis compile list potentially significant developments decision maker review 
best processed information browser format allow decision makers drill detail underlying development find interest 
early predict cost commercial etd software system 
comparable knowledge management text database mining software today cost tens thousands hundreds thousands dollars 
probably carry sort fee structure software packages available today 
vendors charge initial license purchase price require annual maintenance fee provide technical support updates software 
possible buy software individually seat vendors push sell corporate license 
people software purchasing seats sense 
software going enterprise corporate license probably better choice 
cost overlooked impact corporate infrastructure 
capital cost purchase high performance hardware needed run calculation intensive etd applications 
application run existing house servers usually need system administrator possibly database administrator available keep application running 
get picture etd tool look helpful examine perfect world scenario executive information system include etd capability 
characteristics scenario depicted table 
executive decision makers extremely busy want data driven decisions fast possible 
means take kontostathis 
raw data processed useful information 
sufficient information meet current need 
irrelevant information 
information available immediately needed 
information prioritized current need 
information format intuitively easy understand 
information viewed different levels detail 
information viewed multiple perspectives table 
perfect world scenario 
time assemble process raw data 
want complete timely processed information sorted appropriate prioritized order decisions hand 
want waste time looking redundant irrelevant information 
information needs format intuitively easy understand looked different levels detail multiple perspectives 
excellent etd tool characteristics meet needs groups potential users 
continues progress knowledge management text mining tools 
etd systems types tools think possibility practical etd systems eventually available fixed information needs 
building system keep decision maker changing information needs difficult method automatically translate subject areas interest important developments criteria words user etd system 
challenge assure data sources available processing adequate support needs decision maker 
section reviewed practical aspects working etd tool corporate environment 
real test etd system provides useful information new developments decision maker timely manner 
current systems provide required level performance extensively corporate environment 
hope new generations etd tools useful corporate decision makers available
