growing body describes techniques tailor behaviors gestures agents 
endeavors lines current studies examine embodied agents gesture sets behavioral personalities tailored specific users 
personal space findings current study replicate number previous studies described 
previous studies featured number different experimental tasks attempt induce subjects violate personal space agent 
example tried putting small labels agents shirts subjects memorize 
subjects consistently left bubble half meter agent despite realization may perform poorly task 
current study subjects absolutely problem violating personal space agents agents looked 
hypothesize reason subjects willing come close virtual self stemmed kind implicit familiarity intimacy 
way necessarily feel need respect personal space significant doesn feel need respect space virtual self 
findings certainly implications educational commercial systems employing embodied intelligent agents 
agents trying forge kind relationship user may successful look user
