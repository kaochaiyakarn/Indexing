motivation interest role dynamic negotiation electronic business transactions 
negotiation take place parties need agree economists refer market mechanism negotiation mechanism 
defines rules game parties engaged determines space possible actions take 
game party adopts strategy determines exactly actions response actions parties external events effort maximise gain 
mechanism public shared parties individual strategy stays private revealed implicitly actions take 
example consider simple market mechanism english auction 
defined rules buyers post bids time 
ii bid valid higher currently highest bid 
iii termination occurs buyer posted bid minutes 
iv sold buyer current highest bid price bid 
participants auction constrained rules free choice action take 
simple strategy buyer auction set maximum limit price willing pay bid current highest bid held buyer lower price limit 
consider mechanisms strategies 
negotiation automated agents need shared understanding mechanism 
done specification negotiation protocol 
protocol determines flow messages participants specifying agent send message messages send valid responses specified incoming messages 
example negotiation protocol english auction states things potential buyers send messages specifying bids auctioneer receive accept reject message response 
auction terminates participants receive message informing winner winning bid 
various protocols automated negotiation 
toone iterated bargaining auctions 
state art multi agent systems designed single negotiation protocol explicitly hard coded agents usually finite state machines 
leads inflexible environment able accept agents designed 
advance provided standardization activities fipa 
fipa provides formal definitions standard negotiation protocols 
fipa protocol english auction described informally shown 
negotiation protocols formalise interactions agents involved 
specify flow messages omit information regarding aspects rules negotiation market mechanism 
example fipa english auction protocol specify criteria bid acceptable greater current highest bid conditions auction terminate bids arrived minutes 
multi agent environment explicit designer agent protocol aware negotiation rules design agent account 
result exception interaction aspects negotiation mechanism implicit design multi agent system 
perspective software engineering practice approach severe disadvantages negotiation protocol negotiation mechanism sufficient merely standardise protocol 
example agents accurately implementing fipa english auction protocol may differ criteria bid acceptable 
may accept bid greater current highest bid may require bid minimum increment 
standard decisions exactly negotiation rules apply provide standardised way agreeing 
designer agent aware implicit assumptions negotiation protocol ensure agent behaves appropriately 
happen designers multi agent system effectively document ensure agent designers comply 
standard specification market mechanism changed agents comply need updated cope changes 
mechanism rules implicit explicit agents carefully designed generality non trivial task 
assume multi agent system contains mechanisms similar example english auctions different bid increments closing conditions 
standard way agent determining details adjusting behaviour appropriately 
reuse agents multi agent systems difficult 
observations propose alternative currently adopted fipa 
approach allows negotiation rules explicitly specified categorised design implementation stage agent oriented software development 
carry analysis generic negotiation process able capture common aspects wide variety types negotiation 
derive taxonomy declarative rules capture wide variety negotiation mechanisms principled structured way 
ii simple interaction protocol able support mechanism captured declarative rules 
approach advantages generic negotiation process rule taxonomy provide valuable conceptual tools software engineers designing multi agent systems involve negotiation mechanisms 
application result mechanisms represented modular explicit way current approaches 
set rules interaction protocol fully specify negotiation mechanism 
information required design agents negotiation mechanism explicit structured 
agent design implementation easier reduces risks unintentional incorrect behaviour 
opens door research creation analysis novel market mechanisms exploration new combinations rules 
rules specifying negotiation mechanism explicitly represented system possible agent reason cover bargaining auctioning protocols literature 
extend framework cover argumentation negotiation 
determine behaviour strategy 
ideally agent able participate effectively arbitrary negotiation mechanism specified set rules 
far current state art negotiation technology 
negotiation algorithms able participate different negotiation mechanisms able adjust behaviour depending details mechanism 
example agent algorithm able simultaneously participate multiple english dutch sealed bid auctions requiring details bid increments closing times sealed bid winner announcement times determine exact behaviour 
agent algorithm identify auctions different types checking mechanism rules templates identify parameter values rules determine mechanism details 
demonstrate validity approach describe software framework automated negotiation implemented jade allows agents effectively participate negotiations defined rule taxonomy protocol 
software framework form highly modular reusable component multi agent system 
advances state art negotiation protocol approach implement wide variety negotiation mechanisms simply instantiating appropriate sets rules 
ii easy maintain update 
software engineer determines particular negotiation change mechanism need adjust rules appropriately 
iii agents involved negotiation access new rules worst identify current behaviour inappropriate issue warning 
advanced agent able automatically modify behaviour necessary provided changes mechanism great 
generic negotiation framework section abstraction negotiation process developed analysis different negotiations automated human 
develop general protocol negotiation 
negotiation process roles involved negotiation process negotiation participant negotiation host 
market mechanisms participants address auctions participants send messages negotiation host forwards participants right interest seeing 
abstraction participants publish proposals common multicast space negotiation locale managed negotiation host 
negotiation locale considered form blackboard access write visibility information mediated negotiation host 
visibility rules associated proposals participants right see see 
allows see negotiation particular case 
agent playing host role may play participant role negotiation may non participatory auctioneer auction 
cases role negotiation host may alternate different entities negotiation progresses 
action taken participant require admission negotiation 
admission consists simple conversation participant host participant requests admission particular negotiation presents credentials 
credentials participant presents negotiation host decides admit participant negotiation informs participant decision 
participant admitted move negotiation 
admission step important participants informed rules negotiation 
able negotiate parties initially share negotiation template 
specifies different parameters negotiation product type price supply date 
parameters may constrained product type constrained way may completely open price 
negotiation locale negotiation template associated defines object negotiation locale 
part admission process negotiation participants accept negotiation template 
constraints expressed negotiation template remain static negotiation proceeds 
process negotiation move negotiation template acceptable agreement 
single negotiation may involve parties resulting agreements different parties parties reach agreement 
example stock exchange viewed negotiation buyers sellers meet trade stock 
agreements formed buyers sellers buyers 
negotiation participants exchange proposals representing agreements currently acceptable 
proposal contain constraints parameters expressed negotiation template 
proposals sent negotiation host 
proposal accepted locale valid 
valid satisfy criteria valid restriction parameter space defined negotiation template 
constraints represent values parameters currently acceptable 
constraint consist single acceptable value 
proposal submitted set rules govern way negotiation takes place 
rules specify things proposals proposals submitted relation previous submissions 
example auctions model requires participants trust negotiation host 
trust consideration scope 
bid improvement rule requires new proposal buy higher price previous proposals 
rules specified agreed admission stage 
agreement formed agreement formation rules associated negotiation locale 
proposals locale satisfy certain conditions converted rules agreements returned proposers 
negotiation determined termination rules 
example english auction termination rule state auction finishes participant placed bid certain time agreement formation rule state agreement formed highest bidder seller price bidder bid 
process specialised different negotiation styles 
example bargaining participants take turns exchanging proposals previously agreed format 
rules case simple 
proposal long consistent negotiation template turn 
negotiation terminates proposal returned unchanged take declaration acceptance party leaves negotiation locale 
case agreement identical proposal formed 
english auction proposals specify price parameter fully instantiated negotiation template 
negotiation rules state new proposal bid valid improvement current best proposal 
termination occurs deadline agreement formed contain specification expressed negotiation template price specified winning bid 
definition generic negotiation protocol describing admission phase 
protocol requires participant requesting admission send acl propose message negotiation host 
payload message may contain credentials participant 
negotiation host replies acl accept proposal acl reject proposal message signifying admission resp 
rejection participant negotiation 
admission participants submit proposals posting negotiation locale 
participants sending acl propose message negotiation host 
proposal submission continues termination reached defined termination rules 
termination may occur agreement formation bargaining agreement formation auction may independent continuous double auction 
time participant submits proposal negotiation host checks constrained form negotiation template syntactically formed 
fipa acl messages describe protocol 
acls equally 
proposal valid rejected 
submitter notified acl reject proposal message 
proposal passes stage validation negotiation host checks satisfies negotiation rules 
rules define way negotiation take place may include restrictions proposal participants take turns submit semantic requirements valid proposals requirements proposal improve previous ones 
proposal passes second validation stage current set proposals associated data structures updated accordingly submitter participants notified 
notified structure notification defined visibility rules display rules 
submitter notified acl accept proposal message 
notified acl inform messages 
agreement formation process triggered time negotiation agreement formation rules 
negotiation host looks current set proposals determine agreements 
agreements potentially occur negotiating parties compatible proposals 
case agreement formation rules determine exactly proposals matched final instantiated agreement 
agreement rules may state example highest priced offer buy matched lowest priced offer sell final agreement take place average price 
tie breaking agreement rules defined main agreement rules applied ways 
example earlier posted offers may take priority ones 
agreement formation rules applied determine exactly agreements negotiation host notifies participants acl inform messages
