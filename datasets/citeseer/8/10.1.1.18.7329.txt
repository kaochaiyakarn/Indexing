knowledge current open domain systems feedback loops generate lexico semantic alternations 
shows feedback loops enhance significantly performance textual systems 
textual feedback loops initiating search answer natural language question take account fact question similar posed system results 
find cached questions measure similarity previously processed questions reformulation identified system returns corresponding cached correct answer illustrated 
reformulations detected search answers conjecture eventual answer text paragraph contains representative question concepts includes textual concept category expected answer 
current retrieval technology model semantic knowledge break search boolean retrieval question keywords filtering mechanism retains passages containing expected answer type 
question keywords expected answer type identified dependencies derived question parse 
implementing version publicly available collins parser collins learned dependency model enables mapping parse trees sets binary relations head word constituent sibling words 
example parse tree trec question dogs pull sled jj vp np pp np nnp dt nn np dt vbp nns np dogs pull sled possible constituent parse tree rules described magerman jelinek identify head child propagate head word parent 
parse question propagation np sled dt nn dt dogs nns jj np dogs vbp pull sled nnp np pp np sled vp pull pull propagation head modifier relations extracted generating dependency structure called question semantic form harabagiu 
dogs count pull sled structure count represents expected answer type replacing question stem 
question stems unambiguous 
question stem ambiguous expected answer type determined concept question semantic form modifies stem 
concept searched answer taxonomy comprising tops linked significant number wordnet noun verb hierarchies 
top represents possible expected answer types implemented system person product numerical value count location 
encoded total possible answer types 
addition question keywords paragraph retrieval derived question semantic form 
question keywords organized ordered list enumerates named entities question quotations concepts triggered recognition expected answer type followed adjuncts left right order question head 
conjunction keywords represents boolean query applied document index 
moldovan details empirical methods system transforming natural language question ir query 
answer semantic form lexical alternations semantic alternations question semantic form answer logical form unifications expected answer type question logical form abductive proof paragraph loop filter paragraph expected answer type question keywords min loop index loop parse answer documents retrieval cached questions cached answers question question reformulation feedbacks answer search 
known disadvantages boolean retrieval returns documents 
question answering advantage exploited feedback loop represented 
feedback loop triggered number retrieved paragraphs smaller minimal value larger maximal value determined answer type 
alternatively number paragraphs limits paragraphs contain concept semantic category expected answer type filtered 
remaining paragraphs parsed dependency structures called answer semantic forms derived 
feedback loop illustrated activated question semantic form answer semantic form unified 
unification involves steps step recognition expected answer type 
step marks possible concepts answer candidates 
example case trec question originate expected answer type location 
paragraph introduced portugal hawaiian islands contains named entities category lo cation marked accordingly 
step identification question concepts 
second step identifies question words synonyms morphological derivations wordnet hypernyms answer semantic form 
step assessment similarities dependencies 
third step classes similar dependencies considered generating unifications question answer semantic forms class mapping binary dependencies question binary dependencies answer semantic form 
dependencies largely cover question semantic form example answer question sells greetings cards largest sells organization greeting cards hallmark remains largest maker greeting cards organization hallmark maker greeting cards find entailment producing making selling goods derived wordnet synset produce genus manufacture defined gloss homomorphic nominalization sale 
semantic form question illustrated answer similar 
class question semantic form answer semantic form contain new con modifiers missing answer 
cepts impose bridging inference 
knowledge inference lexical nature employed justify correctness answer 
example answer question president france person president france marshall philippe head france government head person marshall philippe government france nouns head government constituents possible paraphrase president head government 
world knowledge justify answer countries prime minister head government 
inference semantic form question answer similar 
feedback loop brings forward additional semantic information 
classes similar dependencies considered abduction answers performed manner similar justifications described harabagiu 
class characterized need contextual information brought forward resolution 
example chain coreference links bill gates microsoft founder candidate answer answer question bill gates go college 
bill gates organization college go bill gates harvard dropout microsoft founder organization college harvard dropout founder microsoft class paraphrases additional information produce significant differences question semantic form answer semantic form 
semantic information contributes normalization answer dependencies unified question dependencies 
example volcano mountain lava part volcano part coming inside fragments lava properties lava question semantic form answer semantic form unified answer question hot inside active volcano get temperature get inside volcano active degrees fahrenheit temperature degrees fragments lava mountain lava fragments mountain hot resulting normalized dependencies temperature degrees lava lava inside volcano active mountain volcano semantic information world knowledge needed unifications available wordnet miller 
knowledge translated axiomatic form abductive proofs 
feedback loops provide retrieval engine new alternations question keywords 
feedback loop considers morphological lexical alternations feedback loop uses semantic alternations 
method generating alternations detailed section 
keyword alternations enhance chance finding answer question feedback loop provides different set keyword alternations 
alternations classified linguistic knowledge morphological alternations 
lexical alternations necessary answer keyword altered determined question word prompted expected answer type semantic class expected answer type 
example case question invented clip expected answer type person subject verb invented lexicalized nominalization inventor 
retrieval mechanism stem keywords inflections verb considered 
initial query expanded query clip invented inventor invent invents 
lexical alternations 
wordnet encodes wealth semantic information easily mined 
types semantic relations span concepts enabling retrieval synonyms semantically related terms 
alternations improve recall answer paragraphs 
example case question killed martin luther king considering synonym killer noun system retrieved paragraphs correct answer 
similarly question far moon adverb far encoded wordnet attribute distance adding noun retrieval keywords correct answer 

semantic alternations paraphrases 
define semantic alternations keyword words collocations wordnet members wordnet synsets containing original keyword chain wordnet relations bigram relations connect original keyword 
relations translated axiomatic form participate abductive backchaining answer question justify answer 
example semantic alternations involving wordnet relations case question live 
wordnet verb prefer verb hypernym glossed definition liking better query query prefer live multiple keywords replaced semantic alternation 
alternations similar relations paraphrases single terms time simply semantically related terms 
case question dogs pull sled definition wordnet sense noun harness contains bigram pull cart sled cart forms vehicles alternation pair keywords pull slide rendered harness 
feedback received paragraph containing correct answer retrieved 
decide keywords expanded form alternations rely set heuristics complement heuristics select question keywords generate queries described moldovan heuristic feedback loop requires addition main verb question query keyword generate verb nominalizations 
heuristic second feedback loop requires lexical alternations collect wordnet synset elements direct hypernyms direct hyponyms verbs nominalizations query 
multiple verbs expand left right order 
heuristic third feedback loop imposes semantic alternations expressed paraphrases verb direct object question selected query keywords search verb object pairs semantically related query pair 
new pairs located glosses synset expand query pair elements set possible alternations defined existence lexical relations pairs words different question detect question reformulations
