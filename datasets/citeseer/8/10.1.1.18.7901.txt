hierarchical representation low level features introduce new approach representing low level features termed monotonic tree 
monotonic tree hierarchical representation image struc tures derivation contour tree discrete data 
contour trees geographic information systems gis medical imaging display scalar data 
example elevation landscape modeled scalar data plane contour called line elevation function assumes value 
contours defined continuous functions 
image represented discrete data continuous function defined interpolation data 
contour tree defined continuous function 
introduce new concept termed monotonic line directly defined discrete data 
outward falling climbing monotonic line gray image boundary image assumes higher lower values pixels retrieval results 
adjacent boundary inside outside 
monotonic lines image form rooted tree called monotonic tree 
maximal sequence uniquely enclosing monotonic lines called monotonic slope 
monotonic slopes image form reduced monotonic tree 
monotonic slope called outward falling climbing monotonic lines outward falling climbing
