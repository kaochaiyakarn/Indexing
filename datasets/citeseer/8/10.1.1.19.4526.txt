demand information increases centralized servers bottleneck 
content providers cope distributing replicas files servers scattered network 
replicas respond local client requests reducing load central server 
replica management refers problem deciding replicas file distribute place 
perfect system replicas placed near clients access 
shrinking network distance decreases access latency sensitivity congestion outages 
exactly replicas exist handle cumulative demand file 
replicas servers overloaded clients see reduced performance 
conversely extra replicas waste bandwidth storage reassigned files money spent rent power cool host machine 
replica management alternatives approaches replica management developed

economic model 
automatic resource management clients compete access server limited resources decision requests important 
economic approach defines importance request amount requester willing pay 
client provides useful feedback priorities offering pay servers certain replicas 
argue money really society best attempt producing ranking relative importance 
economic model helps replica system cope fluctuating demand 
hot spots appear important news breaks popular web site links normally low traffic page high demand increases cost servers charge access replicas hot content 
increase encourages servers host replica distributing load sharing profit 
similarly economy adapt addition deletion machines intervention human administrators 
economy provides easy way decide add new servers system 
system administrators entrepreneurs monitor price fluctuations areas consistently high prices suggests client demand exceeds replica supply 
scalability replica management economies share scalability benefits cooperative alternatives 
local greedy control algorithms avoids computation bandwidth bottlenecks may appear storage allocation network monitoring failure detection performed central authority 
guarantees mechanism design subfield game theory called mechanism design studies techniques setting system rules algorithms prices order induce outcomes certain desired properties 
properties may include cooperation balanced budget various definitions fairness 
simple example define economy clients servers interact second price auction 
client submits bid replica access server awards access highest bidder charges amount bid runner 
shown method guarantees rational clients bid honestly 
generalizations simple second price auction proposed may prove useful replica management economies 
benefits federated environment network machines said federated machines operate separate administrative domains 
may cooperate attain common autonomous primarily concerned success profitability 
fit naturally type environment motivates microeconomics game theory 
explicitly deal real trust administrative boundaries real money 
assume machines may reject requests volunteer truthful information demand payment proportionate expend 
concepts usually grafted systems deployed federated environment 
benefits trusted infrastructure opposite spectrum imagine environment containing single administrative domain 
machines cooperate fully accepting external storage retrieval requests common 
despite apparent differences content distribution networks pure cooperative systems assume environment 
tend employ global allocation algorithm possibly restrict set machines initiate storage requests approaches rely inter machine cooperation 
contrast machines replica management economy accept external requests paid action worthwhile 
need environment machines maintain individual profitability restriction cooperation improve system robustness 
unbounded cooperation conceptually simple morally pleasing allows single machine reduce availability 
poorly configured broken machines may accidentally flood system unnecessary storage requests 
compromised machines may launch denial service attacks 
greedy users consume resources 
faulty malicious machines pay service funds finite 
overloaded machines raise prices demand drops failed machines run money 
trusting models bounds impact failure active attack 
impose similar bound replica management system fixed bounds overly restrictive 
limit flexibility machines functioning perfectly require great deal resources 
limit soft machine acquire access replica willing able pay 
game theory property called consumer 
benefits internet internet arguably important environment consider designing largescale replica system 
networks fully cooperative fully federated contains competitive domains containing machines cooperate completely 
treat domains opaque units impose replica management economy 
ap proach allow competitors share resources safely 
expose machines domain extend economy handle intra domain interactions 
shown economic model provides interesting benefits trusted domains

prevent coalitional activity increasing dependencies machines decreases robustness benefits

general machine requires utility function rates relative worth sets files 
deciding instance discard replica free resources machine simply compares expected utility alternative 
utility function consider storage network resources consumed content stores money expects receive exchange resources amount money plans spend acquire content
