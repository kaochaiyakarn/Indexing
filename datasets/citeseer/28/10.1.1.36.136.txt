robocup soccer server ci etl go jp noda soccer server html designed gp mind 
realize soccer server presents challenge evolutionary computation gp specific important understand domain works 
enforced millisecond delay world model updates full game takes minutes play 
game play sped server players unified program removing udp eliminating millisecond delay 
reasons increase speed dramatically imagined carefully done runs risk changing game dynamics changing game optimize 
reason problem evolving computer program successfully domain require large number evaluations new evaluation soccer simulator trial 
previous experiments considerably simpler cooperation domains luke spector genetic programming require order evaluations find reasonable solution :10.1.1.29.6914
suspected soccer domain worse 
consider just evaluations serial soccer server require full year evolution time 
challenge cut years weeks months produce relatively playing soccer team evolutionary runs 
accomplished ways brute force 
evolved algorithms basic probabilistic mechanism decision making functions kick goal mate far mate

obvious approach form teams populations individual players 
difficulty approach introduces credit assignment problem team wins loses blame credit spread various teammates 
took different approach widely gp tried luke spector genetic programming genome entire team players team stay evaluations breeding :10.1.1.29.6914
raises question homogenous heterogeneous team approach 
homogenous team approach soccer player follow effectively algorithm gp genome single kick move tree pair teammates play 
heterogeneous approach soccer player develop follow unique algorithm gp genome just kick move tree pair forest pairs pair player 
domain heterogeneity useful heterogeneous approach provides considerably flexibility promise specialized behaviors coordination 
ran separate runs different approaches increase chance having show robocup discussed concern justified 
genomes consisted forests trees adapted gp crossover mutation operators accommodate 
runs crossover mutation apply single tree genome 
homogeneous pseudo heterogeneous approaches disallowed crossover kick tree move tree 
approaches allowed trees cross squad restricted breeding previous experience proven useful promoting specialization luke spector :10.1.1.29.6914
introduced special crossover operator root crossover swapped trees root swapping subtrees 
teams effectively trade players hoped spread strategies population rapidly 
reduce run time population sizes final run 
felt small populations problem complexity necessitated somewhat unusual mix breeding operators
