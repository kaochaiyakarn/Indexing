discovering interesting association rules medical data carlos de college computing radiology department college computing georgia institute university georgia institute technology hospital technology presently exploring idea discovering association rules medical data 
technical aspects problem challenging 
case medical data sets small high dimensionality 
information content rich exist numerical categorical time image attributes 
data records generally noisy 
explain map medical data transaction format suitable mining rules 
space constraints impossible compare approach everybody 
proposed approaches basket data 
medical data sets complex new challenges 
incorporates ideas previous mine rules segmented images 
papers published database literature concentrate optimizing phase look problem improving rule generation nd phase :10.1.1.12.8836
instance proposes algorithm summarize associations 
attacks problem inserting transactions mined set proposes algorithm incrementally maintains associations 
proposes scheme identify true correlations proposes new metric called conviction identify strong implications find approach interesting 
shares similarities :10.1.1.12.8836:10.1.1.116.7723

authors propose algorithms constraints include exclude certain items association generation phase focus types constraints items constrained certain hierarchy associations include certain items 
approach limited purposes hierarchies excluding including items mine meaningful rules 
addresses constraining problem general way 
approach var constraints different query oriented dealing rule semantics mapping rule size noisy data
