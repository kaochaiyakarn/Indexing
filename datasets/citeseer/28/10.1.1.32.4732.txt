implementation independence important provides flexibility implementors lead better performance 
graphs similar specifying serializability semantics correctness criterion defining extended transaction models 
approach applies techniques defining ansi commercial isolation levels 
specifications different multi version theory describes conditions serializability specify ansi sql commercial isolation levels multi version systems 
furthermore specifications definitions take predicates account 
substantially different definitions specifications handle multi version systems optimistic systems deal predicates correct flexible manner isolation levels :10.1.1.130.3797

disallowing rule optimistic implementations

reads disallowed optimistic schemes desirable mobile environments commits may take long time clients disconnected servers furthermore reads uncommitted transactions may desirable high traffic :10.1.1.116.1182
example history ift reads values serialized history occur mobile system disallows 
system commits assumed happened tentatively client machines transactions may observe modifications tentative transactions :10.1.1.116.1182:10.1.1.116.1182

phenomenon disallows modification object read uncommitted transaction rules similar situation respect predicates 
uncommitted transactions may read write object concurrently optimistic implementation 
history exhibits phenomenon contains directed cycle consisting entirely write dependency edges 
example history disallowed pl updates occur opposite orders causing cycle graph

history pl specification degree allows concurrent transactions modify object :10.1.1.130.3797
non serializable interleaving write operations possible uncommitted transactions long interleavings disallowed committed transactions aborting transactions 
lock implementation pl long disallows concurrent transactions ti tj modify object writes tj precede follow writes ti 
note predicate modifications modeled queries followed normal writes pl provides weak guarantees updates
