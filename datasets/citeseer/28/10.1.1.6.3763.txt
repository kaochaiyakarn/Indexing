tomorrow web applications need robust efficient data warehouse system succeed dynamic web environments 
maintaining data warehouses changing information sources elke rundensteiner andreas xin zhang years number digital information storage retrieval systems increased 
information sources generally interconnected network task integrating data different sources serve users increasingly important 
applications benefit wealth digital information experiencing pressing need suitable integration tools allow effective distributed diverse data sets 
contrast demand approach information integration approach tailored information repository construction commonly referred data warehousing characterized properties setup time relevant information extracted different information sources network transformed cleaned necessary merged information sources loaded centralized data store data warehouse 
query processing time queries posed system directly evaluated data warehouse interaction original sources

research data warehousing begun go step studied propagation data warehouse maintenance concurrent data updates :10.1.1.48.4672
reasons schema changes schema interface changes quite common difficult database schema complex applications pass application requirements typically change time

data warehouse may special purpose data feeds set pump data sets store 
definition schema structure data warehouse evolves necessary correspondingly adjust content data warehouse store 
due performance demands system size data warehouse store data warehouse content adjustments ideally done incrementally complete data reload 
incremental techniques adaption data warehouse extent critical technology support 
data warehouse maintenance data updates information sources fairly established field maintenance mixture data schema updates remains largely unexplored :10.1.1.48.149
furthermore dynamicity terms schema information incremental data warehouse maintenance algorithms need deal concurrency source updates notifications warehouse maintenance queries result submission warehouse 
maintenance queries submitted information source may find altered schema due source schema change longer matches submitted query format resulting aborted query request
