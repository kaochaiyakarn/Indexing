statistical method estimating usefulness text databases king lup liu clement yu weiyi meng wu rishe dept eecs university illinois chicago chicago il yu eecs edu dept computer science suny binghamton binghamton ny meng cs binghamton edu school computer science florida international university miami fl rishe cs edu june searching desired data internet common ways internet 
single search engine capable searching data internet 
approach provides interface invoking multiple search engines user query potential satisfy users 
number search engines interface large invoking search engines query cost effective creates unnecessary network traffic sending query large number useless search engines searching useless search engines wastes local resources 
problem overcome usefulness search engine respect query predicted 
statistical method estimate usefulness search engine query 
typically query small fraction search engines may contain useful documents query 
result search engine blindly invoked user query substantial unnecessary network traffic created query sent useless search engines 
addition local resources wasted useless databases searched 
better approach identify search engines provide useful results query pass query search engines desired documents 
examples systems employ approach include wais aliweb ggloss savvysearch wise :10.1.1.43.8157:10.1.1.31.1173
challenging problem approach identify potentially useful search engines 
current solution problem rank underlying databases decreasing order usefulness query metadata describe contents database 
ranking measure ordinary users may able utilize fit needs 
query current approach tell user degree accuracy search engine useful second useful ranking helpful tell user useful particular search engine usefulness search engine query measured pair numbers nodoc avgsim nodoc number documents database search engine high potentials useful query similarities query documents measured certain global similarity function higher specified threshold avgsim average similarity potentially useful documents 
section concludes 
related able identify useful search engines query characteristic information database search engine stored metasearch engine 
call information representative search engine 
different methods identifying useful search engines developed representatives 
metasearch engines employed various methods identify potentially useful search engines :10.1.1.31.1173
database representatives metasearch engines estimate number globally similar documents search engine :10.1.1.26.106
addition measures metasearch engines rank search engines difficult understand 
result separate methods convert measures number documents retrieve search engine 
shortcoming measures independent similarity threshold number documents desired user

result search engine ranked regardless documents desired databases search engines fixed 
query search engine may contain moderately similar documents zero highly similar documents

probabilistic model distributed information retrieval proposed 
method suitable feedback environment documents previously retrieved identified relevant irrelevant 
ggloss database distinct terms represented pairs number documents database contain ith term sum weights ith term documents database usefulness search engine respect query ggloss defined sum document similarities query greater threshold :10.1.1.31.1173
usefulness measure informative measure 
example sum similarities documents database tell documents involved 
hand measure derive measure ggloss 
representative ggloss estimate number useful documents database consequently estimate measure 
hierarchical organization representatives number search engines large representatives clustered form hierarchy representatives 
query compared highest level representatives 
representatives ancestor representatives estimated large number similar documents examined 
result database representatives compared query 
similar idea suggested :10.1.1.31.1173
suppose representatives local databases higher level representative representatives hierarchy considered representative database combined union 
discuss obtain assume databases pair wise disjoint 
set terms term probability document contains average weight documents contain mw maximum normalized weight documents oe standard deviation positive weights mw oe probability average weight maximum normalized weight standard deviation term new representative respectively 
discuss obtain mw oe 
experimental results database representative represented set oe mw average normalized weight probability standard deviation maximum normalized weight number original number approximation 
results compared estimates generated method high correlation case previous method proposed 
method similar basic method described section utilizes standard deviation weights term documents dynamically adjust average weight probability query term threshold query 
please see details 
experimental results method disjoint case reported shown method high correlation case performs better disjoint case :10.1.1.31.1173
results database representative represented set original number approximated byte number bit number 
investigate estimation method tolerate certain degree inaccuracy numbers database representative 
experiments subranges method 
subrange contains maximum normalized term weight subranges medians percentile percentile percentile percentile percentile respectively 
current experiments assumption term weights satisfy normal distribution 
distribution may model weights accurately 
examine ways reduce storage requirement database representatives
