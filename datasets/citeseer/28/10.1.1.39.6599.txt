agent computing significant breakthrough software development new revolution software 
currently agents focus intense interest part sub fields computer science artificial intelligence 
agents increasingly wide variety applications ranging comparatively small systems email filters large open complex mission critical systems air traffic control

unfortunately immediately run difficulties key concepts agentbased computing lack universally accepted definitions 
particular real agreement core question exactly agent see franklin graesser discussion 
believe researchers jennings wooldridge find broad agreement definitions wooldridge jennings :10.1.1.119.2204
agent computer system situated environment capable autonomous action environment order meet design objectives 
autonomy difficult concept pin precisely mean simply sense system able act direct intervention humans agents control actions internal state 
may helpful draw analogy notion autonomy respect agents encapsulation respect objectoriented systems 
object encapsulates state control state accessed modified methods object provides 
alleviates need send large amounts raw data distant central processor making efficient communications bandwidth 
natural metaphor notion autonomous agent appropriate metaphor presenting software functionality 
example program filters email user metaphor personal digital assistant maes meeting scheduling software naturally autonomous social agent interact similar agents user behalf 
applications fact functions implemented series local agents means personalized reflect preferences user

legacy systems large organizations software applications especially information systems perform critical organizational functions 
keep pace changing business needs systems periodically updated 
modifying legacy systems general difficult system structure internal operation corrupted passage time designs documentation lost individuals understanding software move 
completely rewriting software tends prohibitively expensive simply impossible 
behaviors simple structures loosely resemble rules require complex symbolic reasoning

agents play part humans theater style applications known believable agents term coined joe bates 
vision agents provide illusion life permitting audience suspension disbelief

comments certain level abstraction applications share common features 
individual agents designed built enact particular roles 
agents autonomous goal directed entities responsive environment 
system implementation agent system design describe various different roles exist system characterize relationships exist roles 
design generally prescribe implementation agents 
having identified various agent roles system step determine roles best realized 
agent architecture needs devised adopted role deliver required functional non functional characteristics role 
agent architectures developed intelligent agents community different properties wooldridge jennings :10.1.1.119.2204
extreme strong ai systems allow users build agents knowledge systems logic theorem provers 
order build agents systems goes standard knowledge system process knowledge elicitation representation coding agent behavior terms rules frames semantic nets 
extreme agent frameworks simply offer enhanced versions example java applications intelligent agents programming language include ai techniques 
extremes strictly right wrong merits drawbacks
