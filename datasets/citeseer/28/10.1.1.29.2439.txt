type processing appropriate tasks information extraction type text skimming retrieves specific types information text 
information extraction systems existed decades systems generally built hand contain domain specific information making difficult port domains 
researchers begun apply machine learning information extraction tasks involved applying learning pieces larger system 
presents novel rule representation specific natural language learning system rapier learns information extraction rules 
rapier takes pairs documents filled templates indicating information extracted learns patterns extract fillers slots template 
information extraction task locating specific pieces data natural language document focus arpa muc program lehnert sundheim 
extracted information stored database queried standard database query languages natural language database interface 
difficulty information extraction systems difficult time consuming build generally contain highly domain specific components making porting new domains time consuming 
efficient means developing information extraction systems desirable 
research computational linguistics indicates empirical corpus methods currently promising approach developing robust efficient natural language processing nlp systems church mercer charniak brill church :10.1.1.62.9319
methods automate acquisition complex knowledge required nlp training suitably annotated natural language corpora parsed sentences marcus santorini 
empirical nlp methods employ statistical techniques gram models hidden markov models hmms probabilistic context free grammars pcfgs

try extend rapier handle document classification task separate slot fixed values 
primary difficulty may issue anchoring rules feasible person identify particular portion document right place anchor rule determining classification document 
idea finding phrases distinguish particular filler values phrases anchor rules described alleviate problem 
options potentially viable weaknesses strengths 
empirical tests required determine best method handling classification issue active learning addition intend active learning techniques specifically selective sampling cohn atlas ladner lewis catlett dagan engelson reduce annotation effort :10.1.1.30.6148:10.1.1.119.2797
training examples equally useful learning system carefully selecting useful examples annotation effort dramatically reduced 
approach successfully training part speech taggers engelson dagan believe helpful information extraction domain 
active learning involves constructing selecting informative training examples passively accepting
