generating user interface code model user interface development environment paulo da silva tony griffiths norman paton department computer science university manchester oxford road manchester pl uk norm cs man ac uk declarative models play important role software design activities allowing designs constructed selectively complex implementation details 
user interface setting model user interface development environments mb uides provide context declarative models constructed related part interface design process 
declarative models usually directly executable may difficult relate existing software components 
important mb uides fit existing software architectures standards provide effective route declarative interface specification running user interfaces

distinctive features teallach include open architecture connects directly existing applications widget sets generation executable interface applications java 
general terms principal contribution describe role mb uides bridge gap underlying application user interface providing user interface designers ability declaratively specify dynamics application interface dialogue 
particular teallach allows designer define declaratively information passed interface user underlying application information subsequently processed

background role mb uides effectively play user interface development process universally accepted 
example task system adept emphasis principally identification refinement user tasks provision facilities interface generation task modelling process augmented knowledge base interface design guidelines produce detailed interface specifications subsequently hand coded
