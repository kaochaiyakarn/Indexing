meta search method reinforced cluster descriptors shen lun lee department computer science hong kong university science technology hong kong china cs ust hk meta search engine acts agent participant search engines 
receives queries users redirects participant search engines processing 
meta search engine incorporating participant search engines better single global search engine terms number pages indexed freshness indexes 
meta search engine stores descriptive data descriptors index maintained participant search engine estimate relevance search engine query received 
ability meta search engine select relevant search engines determines quality final result 
facilitate selection process document space covered search engine described concisely precisely 
search engine indexing smaller part web may refresh index frequently focuses specific network domain edu hk web servers local geographical area 
small focused search engine return pertinent date web pages compared single global search engine 
coverage web small may contain pages relevant user query

meta search engine middleware agent consisting number participant search engines :10.1.1.28.8458:10.1.1.14.8578
participant search engine maintains index offers descriptive information descriptors index meta search engine 
meta search engine records descriptors uses estimate relevance underlying search engines query received 
reduce resource consumption relevant search engines invoked process query

papers addressing issue published 
mentioned server ranking critical problem meta search 

ggloss server ranking regarded baseline server ranking methods :10.1.1.31.1173
document containing query terms server index database computes similarity document query 
ggloss ranking ideal goodness score server sum similarity values 

cori adopts inference network estimate relevance underlying server 
cvv prefers terms distinguish server 
terms larger variances cue validity values stand degree server differ greater weights server ranking 
intuitively larger variance indicates relevant servers separated irrelevant servers 

server ranking method proposed :10.1.1.28.8458
tries rank servers document greatest similarity query server server ranking guarantee similar documents retrieved 
server document greatest similarity query supposed document maximum normalized term weight query terms average normalized term weights query terms 
refer server ranking method similar documents
