appear joint international conference autonomous agents multiagent systems aamas secure multi agent dynamic programming homomorphic encryption application combinatorial auctions makoto yokoo ntt communication science laboratories ntt cho gun kyoto japan url www ntt jp csl members yokoo yokoo ntt jp presents secure dynamic programming protocol utilizes homomorphic encryption 
method multiple agents solve combinatorial optimization problem private information 
specifically method multiple servers cooperatively perform dynamic programming procedures solving combinatorial optimization problem private information sent agents inputs 
compute optimal solution correctly inputs kept secret servers 
secure protocol important fully trusted agent available auctioneer fully trusted combinatorial auction 
utilizing proposed protocol multiple auction servers solve winner determination problem information bids part optimal solution kept secret auction servers

multi agent systems multiple autonomous agents need solve combinatorial optimization problem private information 
example combinatorial auction multiple goods auctioned simultaneously agents need find combination bids disjoint sets goods sum bidding prices maximized 
problem called winner determination problem active research field :10.1.1.56.9425
exists fully trusted agent participants trust auctioneer possible gather private information relevant combinatorial optimization problem trusted agent agent solve problem available centralized optimization technique 
take granted exists trusted agent 
example standard price sealed bid auction highest bidder wins pays price auctioneer collude particular participant reveal information incoming bids participant auction 
strategy proof mechanism second price sealed bid vickrey auction highest bidder wins pays second highest price information participants bids useless discourage collusion auctioneer bidders 
applying secure dynamic programming protocol problem straightforward 
plural evaluators node 
furthermore node evaluation value represents bidding price bidder units 
prevent leakage information bidder act evaluator node 
linear auctions linear auction exist goods :10.1.1.56.9425
goods sequentially ordered 
bidder bk bids bidding price bk lk uk interval lk uk goods bidder wants obtain continuous sequence goods 
assume bidder bids single interval equivalently bids intervals independently 
result auction allocation goods maximizes sum bidders bidding prices
