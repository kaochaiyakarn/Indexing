line analytical processing olap important application database systems 
typically olap data multidimensional data cube 
olap queries complex take hours days run executed directly raw data 
common method execution time precompute queries summary tables subcubes data cube build indexes summary tables 
commercial olap systems today summary tables tobe precomputed picked rst followed selection appropriate indexes 
purpose data di erent operations reconciled stored central database commonly called data warehouse 
analysts data warehouse extract business information enables better decision making 
interactive decision support process called olap line analytical processing distinguish conventional oltp line transaction processing applications 
olap applications require viewing data di erent business perspectives dimensions 
data cube gblp multidimensional view databases critical value sales organized dimensions example sales automobiles organized model color day sale :10.1.1.120.4505
metric interest called measure attribute example 
generally accepted olap systems need view data users 
cell data cube corresponds unique set values di erent dimensions contains value measure set values

order multidimensional view data usually stored form summary tables corresponding subcubes data cube 
hru cient implementation data approach storing data cube known rolap relational olap 
approach data cube stored multidimensional array known md olap 
md olap space consuming sparse data cubes rarely 
imagine solution simple look objects views indexes time 
unfortunately objects consider time higher degree polynomial measures running time 
consider greedy approach approach slightly lower performance guarantee remains close quadratic running time step greedy algorithm 
small degradation performance compared index case considered hru incorporate indexes framework data cube design 
related gray gblp introduce data cube operator generalization sql groupby operator :10.1.1.120.4505:10.1.1.120.4505
key generalization keyword 
commercial systems subcubes data cube precomputed improve performance 
hru harinarayan look problem determining subcubes precompute 
give simple greedy algorithm select subcubes prove strong performance guarantee algorithm 
noted problem size varies factorial number dimensions 
cost model section cost model estimate time answer query view conjunction index view 
consider problem estimating sizes views indexes query results materializing seen number queries views indexes quite large data cubes small dimension 
algorithms depend cost model correctness performance guarantees 
linear cost model suppose answer query view need process table corresponding answer depending availability indexes may process rows table cost answering function number rows table process order answer choose simplest possible cost model cost answering number rows table processed construct result linear cost model hru product :10.1.1.41.1205
slice query consider answering example suppose query sales single part widget view part supplier 
suitable indexes scan entire table query cost jv jv number rows suppose available index ip 
index process rows asks 
average jv rows corresponding part average number rows process answer slice query distinct projection gives number distinct values part noticing number distinct part values number rows subcube part get part size subcube part
