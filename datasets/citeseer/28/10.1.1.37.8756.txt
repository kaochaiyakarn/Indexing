address wide range issues complete agents issues addressed relatively coarse grain 
approach viewed broad shallow 
bates colleagues high level aims include understanding natural artificial complete agent architectures 
broad approach necessarily requires initially shallow approach designing computational agencies 
currently addressing issues agent research language communication agents suggest unimportant irrelevant simply limited research issues tackle particular point 
inadequacies date traced omissions 
earlier cognition affect group university birmingham focused differing agent architectures different simplified models biologically psychologically plausible mechanisms number simulated environments 
ongoing scenario minder looking number babies dynamic possibly hazardous environment situated perceptual organs effectors 
originally proposed sloman subsequently developed cognition affect group provides environment different agent architectures developed :10.1.1.49.6181
parallel development information processing architecture allows different coexisting components complex interactions see 
processes automatic pre attentive sense changes triggered directly example reflexes learnt innate bypass normal processing 
management processes reflective attentive knowledge processes options explicitly considered evaluated selection 
management processes resource limited may require attention filters protect disturbance meta management processes regulate direct involving sort self monitoring
