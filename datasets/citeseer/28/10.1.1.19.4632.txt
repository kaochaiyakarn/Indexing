squares conformal maps automatic texture atlas generation bruno vy nicolas ray rome texture atlas efficient color representation paint systems 
model textured decomposed charts discs chart parameterized unfolded charts packed texture space 
existing texture atlas methods triangulated surfaces suffer limitations requiring generate large number small charts simple borders 
discontinuities charts cause artifacts difficult paint large areas regular patterns 
main contribution new quasi conformal parameterization method squares approximation cauchy equations 
defined objective function minimizes angle deformations prove properties minimum unique independent similarity texture space independent resolution mesh generate triangle flips
