title suggests distinct aspects models propose consider 
rst modelling agents motivated agents act modelling motivated constrained agent doing modelling 
second aspect models motivated agents 
motivation force causes engagement chains built satisfying goals mitigate motivation 
attempting understand nature relationships entities world augmenting necessary able assess relative strengths motivation caused engagements 
similarly cooperation motivation plays greater role cooperation symmetric requires assessment motivation cooperating entities 
concerned investigating motivation describe engagement cooperation

order retrieve goals mitigate motivations autonomous agent assessing ects competing alternative goals 
clearly goals greatest positive contribution motivations agent selected 
schema describes autonomous agent monitors motivations goal generation
