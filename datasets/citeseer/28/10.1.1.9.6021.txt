svm seen new way train polynomial neural network radial basis functions classifiers 
techniques train mentioned classifiers idea minimizing training error usually called empirical risk svms operate induction principle called structural risk minimization minimizes upper bound generalization error 
implementation point view training svm equivalent solving linearly constrained quadratic programming qp problem number variables equal number data points 
problem challenging size data set larger thousands
