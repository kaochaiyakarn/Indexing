approximate nearest neighbor queries fixed dimensions arya david mount set points dimensional euclidean space ae query point wish determine nearest neighbor point euclidean distance minimum 
goal preprocess point set queries answered efficiently possible 
assume dimension constant independent reasonably solutions problem exist small increases performance algorithms degrades rapidly 
randomized algorithm approximate nearest neighbor searching 
set points ae constant ffl produce data structure query point point reported distance query point factor ffl true nearest neighbor 
algorithm runs log expected time requires log space
