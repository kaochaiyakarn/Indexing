prototype feature selection sampling random mutation hill climbing algorithms david skalak department computer science university massachusetts amherst ma skalak cs umass edu goal reducing computational costs sacrificing accuracy describe algorithms find sets prototypes nearest neighbor classification 
term prototypes refers instances nearest neighbor computation instances respect similarity assessed order assign class new data item 
algorithms rely stochastic techniques search space sets prototypes simple implement 
monte carlo sampling algorithm second applies random mutation hill climbing 
datasets show prototypes give predictive accuracy equal superior basic nearest neighbor algorithm run time storage costs approximately times greater 
briefly investigate random mutation hill climbing may applied select features prototypes simultaneously
