incremental learning algorithm automatically derived discriminating features propose new technique incrementally derive discriminating features input space 
technique casts classification problems class labels outputs regression problems numerical values outputs unified regression problem 
virtual labels formed clustering output space 
virtual labels extract discriminating features input space 
procedure performed recursively 
organize resulting discriminating subspace coarse fine fashion store information decision tree
