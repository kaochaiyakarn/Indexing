cache digests alex duane wessels national laboratory applied network research april presents cache digest novel protocol optimization technique cooperative web caching 
cache digest allows proxies information cache contents available peers compact form 
peer uses digests identify neighbors document 
cache digest promising alternative traditional request query reply schemes icp 
discuss design ideas cache digest implementation squid proxy cache 
performance cache digest compared icp real world web caches operated nlanr 
potential security problem exists cache digest objects corrupted 
note may case update conditions described holds true 
common sense suggests purging objects hold 
case need support delete notifications addition notification sent 
supporting deletes simple implement consume extra memory proxy maintains digest :10.1.1.153.5656
digest accuracy cache digests increase uncertainty level cache requests 
false misses lead lower hit ratios peers reduce hierarchy utilization 
design false misses rarely occur false hits 
propose relatively simple mechanism handle false hits 
central mapping service ties number caches 
mapping service directs proxies fetch cached objects 
crisp system works autonomously managed caches 
wide area configuration network rtt cache crisp server may introduce significant delays
