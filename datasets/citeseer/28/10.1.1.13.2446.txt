astrolabe robust scalable technology distributed system monitoring management data mining van renesse kenneth birman werner department computer science cornell university ithaca ny ken cs cornell edu scalable management self organizational capabilities emerging central requirements generation large scale highly dynamic distributed applications 
developed entirely new distributed information management system called astrolabe 
astrolabe collects large scale system state permitting rapid updates providing fly attribute aggregation 
capability permits application locate resource knowing machines resides offers scalable way track system state evolves time 
combination features possible solve wide variety management self configuration problems 
describes design system focus scalability 
extended protocol participants protocol apply condition filter clause added query calculates set routers decide routers forward message 
topic publish subscribe expressed having publisher specify message delivered subscribers particular topic 
challenge efficiently evaluate query losing scalability 
example new attribute potentially defined sql condition system doing scales poorly conditions 
solution scales reasonably uses bloom filter compress single bit query bit vector :10.1.1.20.2080
solution associates fixed size bit map covering query 
assume moment goal simply implement publish subscribe potentially large number topics 
define hashing function topics mapping topic bit value 
condition tagged message hash topic associated attribute aggregated bitwise 
top levels name space fully replicated kept eventually consistent gossip algorithm astrolabe astrolabe apply aggregation functions hierarchical gossiping scalability inherently limited 
amount storage grows total bandwidth taken gossip grows size gossip messages grows linearly number members 
scaled servers 
astrolabe time analysis simulation indicate astrolabe potentially scale millions 
applies variants protocol databases bayou anti entropy protocol golding timestamped anti entropy protocol :10.1.1.127.832:10.1.1.21.3642

studied various epidemic protocols including ones astrolabe power constraint wireless sensor networks 
astrolabe scale dozen machines provide various problem specific functionality management distributed system 
astrolabe shrink wrapped application incorporated cluster management system support scalability 
peer peer routing peer peer routing protocol prp routes messages locations determined location independent key included corresponding message 
protocol may build called distributed hash table simply having location provide way map key value 
known examples include chord pastry tapestry protocols implement distributed file systems application level multicast protocols :10.1.1.111.1818
astrolabe location runs agent 
receiving message agent inspects key responsible key forwards message agent knows key 
number hops grows named size routing tables maintained agents
