computer vision vancouver canada vision motion capturing hand articulation challenging task hand presents motion high degrees freedom 
model approaches taken approach problem searching high dimensional hand state space matching projections hand model image observations 
highly ine cient due curse dimensionality 
fortunately natural hand articulation highly constrained largely reduces dimensionality hand state space
