automatic text summarization multiple documents thesis proposal jade goldstein language technologies institute carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa jade cs cmu edu june era electronic text information exponentially growing time critical resource virtually impossible user browse read large numbers individual documents 
important explore methods allowing users locate browse information quickly collections documents 
automatic text summarization multiple documents fulfills information seeking goals providing method user quickly view highlights relevant portions document collections 
little multi document summarization single document summarization subject focus years 
multi document summarization differs single issues compression speed redundancy passage selection critical formation useful summaries

thesis time schedule 
exponential growth online textual information world wide web internal documentation databases increasingly important provide improved mechanisms find textual information effectively 
conventional ir systems find rank documents maximizing relevance user query 
systems include sub document relevance assessments convey information user techniques text tiling :10.1.1.144.4470
single document summarization systems provide automated generic query relevant summary 
summary minimally provides indication information content document user choose read 
effective ideal summary contain content user searching 
large scale ir summarization truly integrated functionality challenges summarization system greater true ir topic detection context 
summarization significantly difficult compression demands increase 
furthermore small users need able vary summary size collection access context text span summary retrieve original document information 
user interface supports functions key component 

problem summarization presents greater challenges multi document single document summarization :10.1.1.44.6285
example multi document summary may contain text spans documents 
text span summary contains pronoun preceding referent false indication association prior referent linked leave reader insufficient information understand text span

approach multi document summarizer muse consists main components 
statistical linguistic feature summarizer selects relevant diverse text spans inclusion summaries modified version maximal marginal relevance metric builds previous single document summarization additional available information text collection relationships documents individual documents address items listed :10.1.1.188.3982
second user interface provides features necessary browsing viewing summaries documents ability add context browse particular documents view clusters documents weight various attributes 
evaluation domain domain provides items described previous section newswire domain 
contains daily redundancy due reporting multiple news sources original source temporal redundancy due fact events tend occur varying time windows background information repeated articles ability high compression ratios selection multiple articles summarize inherent temporal dimension due nature news 
furthermore focus single document summarization newswire articles

ideal text summary includes relevant information user looking excludes extraneous redundant information providing background suit user profile 
coherent comprehensible qualities difficult achieve natural language processing handle issues anaphora fortunately possible exploit regularities patterns lexical repetition document structure generate reasonable summaries document genres having natural language understanding 
dimensions summarization ffl construct natural language generated summary created semantic representation reflects structure main points text extract summary contains pieces original text 
ffl type generic summary gives sense document content summary presents content closely related search query user model 
newswire articles web pages short documents computer science technical reports medium long documents medium defined approximately pages long pages 
focusing indicative informative summaries extracts generic query relevant summarization 
continue examine query relevant generic single document summarization newswire domain 
summaries evaluated tipster conference perform certain extrinsic tasks indicating document relevance topic indicating category document intrinsic tasks contain answers specific questions 
summaries evaluated extract relevant portions text intrinsic focus research :10.1.1.43.2286:10.1.1.11.9344
multi document past years multi document summarization subject great interest due rapid increase textual information virtually impossible users browse read individual documents 
researchers extended various aspects single document approaches look multi document summarization 
include comparing templates filled extracting information specialized domain specific knowledge sources document generating natural language summaries templates comparing named entities extracted specialized lists documents selecting relevant section finding chains document set identify common sections interest building activation networks related lexical items identity mappings synonyms hypernyms extract text spans document set 
approach differs ways attempts domain independent techniques mainly fast statistical processing explicitly deals issue reducing redundancy modules parameterized different genres corpora characteristics taken account easily 
sentence scored formula ordered summary rank order 
score delta gamma delta set statistical features set linguistic features query weights features set weights tuned type data set type summary desired 
example user wants summary attempts answer questions linguistic features name place boosted weighting 
cmu ge features section tipster formal evaluation success 
linguistic features include quotations thematic phrases :10.1.1.43.2286
furthermore different document genres assigned weights reflect individual linguistic features method ge 
example known fact summaries newswire stories usually include sentence article see table 
accordingly feature reasonably high weight news wire genre 
statistical features include standard ones information retrieval cosine similarity tfidf weights pseudo relevance feedback query expansion techniques local context analysis thesaurus expansion methods wordnet inclusion query vectors user interest profiles methods eliminate text span redundancy maximal marginal relevance maximal marginal relevance maximal marginal relevance passage document ranking method passage ranked list selected combined criterion query relevance novelty information :10.1.1.188.3982:10.1.1.49.3174:10.1.1.92.3553

course users may prefer drill narrow topic panoramic sampling bearing relevance query 
best user tunable method maximal marginal relevance mmr provides precisely functionality discussed 
modern ir search engines produce ranked list retrieved documents ordered declining relevance user query summarization engines techniques tend include passages principle

contrast relevant novelty potentially superior criterion 
approximation measuring relevant novelty measure relevance novelty independently provide linear combination metric 
linear combination called marginal relevance document high marginal relevance relevant query created article case generic summarization contains minimal similarity previously selected passages 
idea maximize marginal relevance summarization prior document retrieval method labelled maximal marginal relevance mmr :10.1.1.188.3982
mmr def arg max sim gamma gamma max sim document collection document stream query user profile ir ranked list passages retrieved ir system relevance threshold retrieve passages degree match number documents subset passages selected set difference set documents sim similarity metric passage retrieval relevance ranking passages query sim sim different metric 
definition mmr computes incrementally standard relevance ranked list parameter computes maximal diversity ranking documents 
intermediate values interval linear combination criteria optimized 
users wishing sample information space query set smaller value wishing focus multiple potentially overlapping reinforcing relevant documents set value closer 
detailed sets sentences indicate transformations highly accurate especially document genre newswire articles
