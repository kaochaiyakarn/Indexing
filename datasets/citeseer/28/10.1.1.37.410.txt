suite database replication protocols group communication primitives kemme alonso information communication systems research group institute information systems swiss federal institute technology eth eth ch zurich mail inf ethz ch proposes family replication protocols group communication order address concerns expressed database designers regarding existing replication solutions 
due concerns current database systems allow inconsistencies resort centralized approaches reducing key advantages provided replication 
protocols take advantage semantics group communication relaxed isolation guarantees eliminate possibility deadlocks reduce message overhead increase performance 
simulation study shows feasibility approach flexibility different types bottlenecks circumvented 
replication seen mechanism increase availability performance distributed databases 
done area refer traditional replication protocols synchronous update protocols copy serializability object appear logical copy execution concurrent transactions coordinated equivalent serial execution logical copy 
primary copy approaches updates single copy eliminates concurrent updates introduces single point failure 
approach may criticized arguments traditional research solutions justified especially point view commercial products performance takes precedence consideration 
view gap theory practice question needs addressed possible design synchronous update protocols suffer drawbacks outlined 
believe answer lies tighter integration transaction management underlying communication system 
initial direction idea exploit group communication push software hierarchy basic functions avoiding performance limitations current solutions :10.1.1.128.9931:10.1.1.48.8564
addition proposed protocols take consideration fact databases usually provide range consistency levels commonly restrictive considered traditional approaches 
family protocols easily integrated current sys tems provide reasonable performance transactional semantics centralized systems 
organized follows section describes system model 
section presents replication protocols different isolation levels
