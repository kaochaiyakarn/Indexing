agent architectures flexible practical teamwork milind tambe information sciences institute computer science department university southern california admiralty way marina del rey ca tambe isi edu www isi edu soar tambe teamwork complex dynamic multi agent domains highly flexible coordination communication 
simply fitting individual agents precomputed coordination plans cause severe failures teamwork domain specificity hinders reusability 
central hypothesis key flexibility reusability agent architectures integrated teamwork capabilities 
fundamental shift agent architectures illustrated implemented candidate steam 
steam founded joint intentions theory practical operationalization required integrate key novel concepts team synchronization establish joint intentions ii constructs monitoring joint intentions repair iii decision theoretic communication selectivity pragmatically extend joint intentions theory
