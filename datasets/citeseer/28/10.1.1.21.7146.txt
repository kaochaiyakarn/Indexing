klava relies concept tuple space 
tuple space multiset tuples sequences information items 
klava handles multiple distributed tuple spaces placed nodes net 
node accessed locality contains single tuple space processes execution 
avoided spawning process execution charge putting code locally executing eval self case code self contained procedures going sent 
downloading code net exposes executing machine security risks code execute dangerous operations malicious way due programming errors may tamper processes system 
cope problem implemented activated node allow processes downloaded net sent remote nodes execute operations critical system resources 
implementations security mechanisms rely new java security model capability type system expressing forcing policies control accesses resources data progress
