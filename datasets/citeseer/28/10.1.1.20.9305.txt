transductive inference text classification support vector machines thorsten joachims universitat dortmund ls viii dortmund germany joachims ls cs uni dortmund de introduces transductive support vector machines text classification 
regular support vector machines svms try induce general decision function learning task transductive support vector machines take account particular test set try minimize misclassifications just particular examples 
presents analysis suited text classification 
theoretical findings supported experiments test collections 
experiments show substantial improvements inductive methods especially small training sets cutting number labeled training examples twentieth tasks 
proposes algorithm training efficiently handling examples
