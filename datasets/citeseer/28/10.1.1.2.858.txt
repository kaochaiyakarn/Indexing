boston university computer science technical report bu november recognition human action moment features computer science department boston university boston ma performance different classification approaches evaluated view approach motion representation 
view approach uses computer vision image processing techniques register process video sequence :10.1.1.30.3715
motion representations called motion energy images motion history images constructed 
representations collapse temporal component way explicit temporal analysis sequence matching needed 
statistical descriptions computed features dimensionality reduction techniques 
tests hu moments invariant scale translation 
excellent review motion understanding 
groups fitting explicit structural models reconstruction normally needed 
overlapping group techniques achieve motion understanding recognizing sequences static configurations may require explicit reconstruction knowledge model example 
relevant group approaches related try achieve recognition motion directly sequence images 
explicit static images done needed represent motion :10.1.1.27.7641
give brief overview fundamentals 
recognition repetitive motion achieved basis bottom processing identifying specific parts classification object 
approach needs estimate local velocity undo translation looming objects stationary respect translation 
spatiotemporal template match motion 
relevant sense uses mhi mei moment features represent classify actions classification approaches tested nearest neighbor 
avoid object stationarity requirement allow multiple motions object registration technique developed authors 
technique allows tracking trajectory recovery multiple objects 
segmentation object centered representations obtained technique front motion analysis 
overview description approach computer vision image processing techniques plan recognize specific actions performed people set predefined actions :10.1.1.30.3715
settings assume static background fixed camera major occlusion people performing actions subject external agent
