automatic intelligent web exploration benefit shallow information extraction techniques brought different domains 
major bottleneck lies far difficult expensive modeling lexical knowledge extraction rules ontology define information extraction system 
bootstrapping approach allows fast creation ontology information extracting system relying basic components viz 
core information extraction system ontology engineering environment inference engine 
extensive machine learning techniques support semi automatic incremental bootstrapping domain specific target information extraction system
