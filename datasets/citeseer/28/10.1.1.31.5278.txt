architecture object model distributed object oriented real time databases john stankovic son department computer science university virginia va confluence computers communications databases quickly creating global virtual database applications require real time access temporally accurate multimedia data 
particularly true military intelligence applications required features needed commercial applications 
developing distributed database called beehive offer features different types requirements realtime fault tolerance security quality service audio video 
support features potential trade offs provide significant improvement performance functionality current distributed database object management systems 
high level design beehive architecture sketch design beehive object model bom extends object oriented data models incorporating time features objects 
generation internet provide order magnitude improvement computer communication infrastructure 
support notion performance guarantees hard real time constraints applications project 
distributed active real time database system prototype event triggered real time database system dynamic scheduling sets transactions developed sweden 
reactive behavior modeled eca rules 
current prototype support temporal constraints data multimedia information 
allow applications utilize multiple remote databases dynamic heterogeneous environments notion mediator introduced prototype implemented penguin system :10.1.1.11.8981
mediator software module exploits encoded knowledge certain sets subsets data create information higher layer applications 
mainly deals mismatch problem encountered information representation heterogeneous databases real time fault tolerance issues pursued beehive 
commercial database systems oracle sybase allow storage multimedia data usually done blob binary large object systems integrated real time applications 
developed industry project data remote video cameras transferred atm network displayed windows provide best effort services
