boid architecture conflicts beliefs obligations intentions desires jan huang van der torre division mathematics computer science vrije universiteit de boelelaan hv amsterdam www cs vu nl boid huang cs vu nl introduce called beliefs desires boid architecture 
contains feedback loops consider ects actions committing mechanisms resolve con icts outputs components 
agent types realistic social agents correspond speci types con ict resolution embedded boid architecture 

various competing decision models autonomous agents proposed unclear type model type application 
example decision models goal planning variants decision theory qualitative decision theory models cognitive models belief desire intention models models social concepts obligations norms deontic action programs :10.1.1.28.7820
agent types represented control loops 
realistic agent beliefs override obligations intentions desires single minded stable agent intentions override desires obligations open minded unstable agent desires obligations override intentions sel sh agents desires override obligations social agents obligations override desires
