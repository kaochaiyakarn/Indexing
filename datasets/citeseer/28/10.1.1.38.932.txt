detailed motivations itinerant agents :10.1.1.43.7985
fall broadly categories support mobile computers lightweight devices emerging need rapidly evolving networks asynchronous method searching information transaction services 
example 
reduction communication traffic low bandwidth high latency high cost access networks typically employed mobile computers 

idea dispatching program execution remote computer quite old 
motivation local computer capacity execute program 
remote computer direct access resource attached peripheral efficiently exported network 
schemes employed enable mini computers submit batch jobs mainframes receive results typically print files back local processing 
executable scripts dispatched networks mini computers permit distributed real time processing :10.1.1.125.3310
scripts focus attention 
concept active mail enable widely available electronic mail services deliver executable scripts 
telescript mobile scripting language example deployed initial set services public network 
telescript provides security features intended support electronic commerce means mobile agents 
programs typically written java language compiled machine independent intermediate code 
intent allow great flexibility function presentation information retrieved server preserving security local system carefully controlling received program

section presents brief overview basic security issues concerns 
detailed treatments concentrating new issues arise agent highly distributed systems may 
obviously efficient 
fundamental security building block itinerant agent environment digital signature 
digital signatures typically associated public key cryptography best known popular method obtaining digital signatures rsa public key cryptosystem :10.1.1.40.5588
public key digital signatures concept universal certification potential signers users originate agents amps execute 
universal certification lengthy cumbersome process involves establishment global certification hierarchy similar electronic mail
