cs columbia edu computer science dept columbia university luis gravano gravano cs columbia edu solve common information needs ignore information hidden search interfaces called hidden web way access information available hidden web metasearchers provide users unified searchable interface query multiple databases simultaneously :10.1.1.46.7753:10.1.1.103.9343:10.1.1.14.8578
metasearcher performs main tasks 
receiving query determines best databases evaluate query database selection translates query suitable form database query translation retrieves merges results different sources results merging returns user uniform interface 
metasearching central component digital libraries initiative phase project columbia university involves departments computer science medical informatics electrical engineering columbia university libraries large number industrial partners ibm ge lucent 
project named personalized retrieval summarization image video language resources main goal provide personalized access distributed patient care digital library 
metasearching complicated different access methods source range public cgi interfaces proprietary access methods inside columbia hospital 
key features project abilities access distributed resources regardless available locally internet fuse repetitive conflicting information multiple relevant sources concisely retrieved information 
exploiting variety information sources challenging task benefit information sources supporting common interface searching metadata extraction 
defining new protocol interface distributed sources support decided exploit existing efforts project 
specifically built complementary protocols distributed search sdlip starts combined define sdarts pronounced ess focus :10.1.1.29.8868
sdlip simple digital library interoperability protocol protocol jointly developed stanford university university california berkeley santa barbara san diego supercomputer center california digital library 
sdlip protocol defines layered uniform interface query retrieve results searchable collection common interface
