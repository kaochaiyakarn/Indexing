querying databases multiple examples ishikawa ravishankar number christos faloutsos users easily express queries 
example multimedia image content setting user want photographs current systems qbic user give sample query specify relative importance color shape texture 
worse user want correlations attributes example traditional medical record database medical researcher want nd mildly patients implied query weight height lb inch 
goal provide user friendly theoretically solid method handle queries 
allow user give examples optionally goodness scores propose novel method guess attributes important correlations important weight 
contributions twofold formalize problem minimization problem show solve optimal solution completely avoiding ad hoc heuristics past
