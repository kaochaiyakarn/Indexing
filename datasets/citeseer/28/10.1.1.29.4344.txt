critical note stable model semantics wang peter school computer studies university leeds email scs leeds ac uk april argue stable model semantics valued version conceptually flawed 
semantics logic programming deductive databases extensively studied past decades 
spectrum semantic theories logic programs proposed ranging infer little information logic program skeptical infer great deal credulous 
skeptical semantics founded semantics credulous stable model semantics different equivalent valued versions including stable models partial stable models preferred extensions 
chief drawback stable semantics valued stable model defined logic programs 
valued variant model defined model may leave atoms undetermined 
delta transform fixpoint gamma gamma fp qg fpg gamma gamma fqg gamma fp qg fp qg gamma point proposed models turn stable 
computational process transformed program manages generate correct solution fpg stability tested

appropriate revising mechanism enable assign proper meaning program quasi stable semantics fpg equivalently fp qg unique quasi stable model :10.1.1.16.1953

note gamma logically implies reasonable expect fa pg fnot pg intended meaning 
minimal models giving unique stable model full program second example shows sort oscillating behaviour stable model motivation 
belief anomalies arise trying compute non monotonic negation process allow retraction previously assumed negative information light new positive 
non monotonic negation required logic programs database context computed non monotonic revision process 
process allows withdraw revising held negative information hope adequate model non monotonic negation 
quasi stable semantics logic program propose model negation stable semantics allows mechanism just withdrawal previously assumed negative information :10.1.1.16.1953
