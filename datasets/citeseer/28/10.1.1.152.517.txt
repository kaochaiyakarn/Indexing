research examine retrieval topically organized collections subdivided clustering human designed category scheme considerable abstractness complexity 
investigation different merging algorithms topically organized data unique 

previous research topical organization look ways subdividing large corpora date source topic 
chronological organization particularly appropriate corpora continual influx new documents news archives patents 
new collection added week month year chronologically organized sets collections tend convenient statistical properties similar sizes term frequency distributions 
disadvantage documents relevant query may scattered collections allowing little chance finding search restricted small number collections query concerns news event gets coverage narrow time window 
second common mode organization source example associated press wall street journal federal register simulate retrieval different providers 
organization source falls topical chronological different sources tend concentrate somewhat different content 
topical organization documents similar subjects grouped collection 
grouping done relevant documents query potentially small number collections van rijsbergen cluster hypothesis closely associated documents relevant queries 
tradition early clustering documents evaluating queries clusters single documents xu croft shown trec queries topical organization global clustering fact concentrate relevant documents small number collections 
xu croft divided trec collections subcollections source topic clustering 
far better retrieval performance subcollections divided topic compared heterogeneous subcollections divided source 
retrieval best topical subcollections comparable centralized retrieval retrieval best source subcollections showed lower precision centralized retrieval 
creating distributed patent system chose topical organization patent class patent belongs patent classes 
trec clusters patent classes human design currently active patent searchers uspto united states patent trademark office 
patents manually assigned classes extremely criteria 
automatic classification patent classes works surprisingly poorly suggesting groupings obtain clustering 
data provide testbed generalizing clustering results topical organization extremely different basis 
collection ranking collection selection research considers distributed collections autonomous private 
assumed costly query available collections small number selected 
researchers rely manually created characterizations collections require set queries topics relevance judgements select collections largest numbers relevant documents topics similar new query 
interested class approaches including cori ggloss characterize different collections collection statistics term frequencies :10.1.1.46.8448
statistics select rank available collections relevance query usually assumed available cooperative providers 
alternatively statistics approximated sampling uncooperative providers set queries 
study compare approaches cori topic modeling 
distributed patent system uses cori net collection retrieval information network approach inquery described detail section method shown successful ranking collections outperforms best alternative approaches :10.1.1.46.8448

results merging typical distributed retrieval situation document scores different providers may computed differently provided 
user single ranked list lists merged accurate single ordering 
scores provided solutions depend ranking collections number ordering documents retrieved collection
