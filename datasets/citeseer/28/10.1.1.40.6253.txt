higher level agent works distinct phases sensing thinking acting 
traditional single threaded approaches posix threads break phases implement concurrently 
details parallel implementation significantly improve agent responsiveness performance described 
implementation results show multi threaded approach clearly outperforms terms efficiency responsiveness scalability 
proposed approach efficient multi processor systems
