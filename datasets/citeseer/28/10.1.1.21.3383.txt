important application reinforcement learning rl finite state control problems difficult problems learning control balancing exploration exploitation tradeoff 
existing theoretical results rl give little guidance reasonable ways perform exploration 
examine convergence single step policy rl algorithms control 
policy algorithms separate exploration learning confront exploration problem directly
