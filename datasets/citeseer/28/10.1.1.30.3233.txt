query committee seung institute physics center neural computation hebrew university jerusalem israel seung mars ac il opper institut fur universitat germany manfred opper uni de sompolinsky institute physics center neural computation hebrew university jerusalem israel galaxy ac il propose algorithm called query committee committee students trained data set 
query chosen principle maximal disagreement 
algorithm studied toy models high low game perceptron learning perceptron 
number queries goes infinity committee algorithm yields asymptotically finite information gain 
leads generalization error decreases exponentially number examples 
marked contrast learning randomly chosen inputs information gain approaches zero generalization error decreases relatively slow inverse power law
