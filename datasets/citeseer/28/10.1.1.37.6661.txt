jennings qmw ac uk campos es presents high level framework analysing designing intelligent agents 
framework key abstraction mechanism new computer level called social level 
social level sits immediately knowledge level defined allen newell concerned inherently social aspects multiple agent systems 
strategies agent centric view world success individual sole metric performance evaluation 
downside individual agents considerably difficult predict system behave perform properties 
agents viewed tool social simulation ferber gilbert precisely desired 
aim building system harness power computer discover observe patterns behaviour emerge interplay individuals 
arguably role agent systems greatest impact warner solution technology complex industrial commercial applications industrial control jennings manufacturing parunak telecommunications air traffic control rao georgeff :10.1.1.37.7970
applications balance needs struck needs individual agents system 
example agent sole control production resource need system perspective important provider willing produce resource consumers situations system may deadlock 
similarly agent perform action efforts majority means influencing destructive agent perform undesirable action system may 
individual community balance required ensure system individual agents able function effective manner necessary dependencies exist agents previously described individual community balance obtained 
firstly multi agent systems best described models treat existence interactions multiple actors fundamental category gasser kl concept distribution represent multiple entities interactions 
secondly principle rationality insufficient describing range desirable social behaviour 
example consider case number agents decide search lost item adapted searle 
assuming item discovered agents satisfied original goal 
part intuitive notion working successful agent inform fellow searchers target abandon search bratman jennings cohen levesque :10.1.1.36.6876
additional behaviour warranted principle rationality informing action satisfy finder goals 
particular rational agents notion performing actions greater permitted helpful actions connected agent goals contradict principle rationality helpful actions agent goals naturally permissible

goals members carry problem solving achieve goals 
goals precise rendezvous member pm relatively vague survive 
encoded explicitly bdi architectures jennings rao georgeff implicitly reactive architectures brooks members :10.1.1.37.7970:10.1.1.36.6876
goals may individual belong member may social belong number members society 
member goals satisfied ways actions carries actions carried members combination 
composition laws compositional laws govern way society members structured 
structure gives information types inter agent interdependencies exist crucial determinant social behaviour 
agents concerned individual benefits losses self interested agents 
enable comparisons take place classes agent situated identical social contexts 
agents interactions simple possible results depended solely type agent particular coordination cooperation algorithm 
reason experiment involved precisely members individual performance monitored rest society arbitrarily complex collection members arbitrary social organisation 
agents basic architecture loosely grate jennings :10.1.1.36.6876
core architecture situation assessment module generates new local goals agent environmental conditions decides adopt incoming requests members community 
component embodies agent behavioural rules 
agenda management module ensures agenda kept date changed appropriately reflect agent current perception situation 
goal execution module responsible determining goals met invoking necessary domain problem solving activity
