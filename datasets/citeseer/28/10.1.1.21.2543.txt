furthermore motivate concept autonomy basic property agent oriented school discuss development history programming paradigms lead perspective software systems 
concluded outlook new paradigm change way think software systems 
agents multi agent systems currently interesting research fields computer science community especially natural way capturing structure behavior complex systems stimulated huge interest 
agent oriented software engineering aose new software paradigm 
object management system responsible representing relations inheritance defined classes object manipulation creating destroying objects 
furthermore object management system responsible dynamic aspects method selection objects exception handling garbage collection 
agent oriented runtime system things distinctly complicated similar general structure
