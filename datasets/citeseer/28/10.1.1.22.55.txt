example user subscription may consist interest airplane certain type exceed certain price 
published event may consist er airplane certain properties including price 
subscription closely resembles trigger long lived conditional query associated action usually informing subscriber 
general trigger novel data structures implementations may enable creation scalable high performance publish subscribe systems

counting algorithm consists counting subscription number hits number satis ed predicates 
achieve algorithm maintains association table giving predicate subscriptions occurs 
time predicate satis ed count corresponding subscriptions incremented 
sift sdi system allowing users subscribe documents specifying set weighted keywords 
matching algorithm proposed pereira uses similar approach algorithm 
algorithm groups subscriptions respect number predicates algorithm

performance evaluation shows bene prefetching multi attribute hashing tables 
second technique consists compiling subscription predicates test network treat tree structure :10.1.1.46.2504
internal nodes represent tests predicates leaves network contain subscriptions 
events enter network root network tested internal nodes progressing node node node test succeeds 
event having successfully satisfy tests path reaches leaf obtain matching subscriptions
