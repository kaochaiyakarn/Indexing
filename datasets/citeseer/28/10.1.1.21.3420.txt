mining source coverage statistics data integration kambhampati department computer science engineering arizona state university az data integration shown importance statistical information coverage overlap sources efficient query processing 
despite recognition effective approaches learning needed statistics 
key challenge learning statistics keeping number needed statistics low storage learning costs manageable 
naive approaches infeasible quickly 
set connected techniques estimate coverage overlap statistics keeping needed statistics tightly control 
approach uses hierarchical classification queries threshold variants familiar data mining techniques dynamically decide level resolution learn statistics 
specifically need access source maximum value order compute need know overlap sources represented probability probability simple matter compute example demonstrates need coverage overlap statistics query optimization 
sources tend autonomous data integration scenario gathering coverage overlap statistics poses challenges 
impractical assume sources export statistics 
consequently data integration systems able learn coverages sources 
previous addressed issue model statistics part query optimization nk effectively learning statistics formula generalized compute number selected sources refers query :10.1.1.106.8424:10.1.1.21.3444
place 
consider issue learning coverage overlap statistics sources 
key challenge problem keep number needed statistics low storage learning costs manageable 
naive approaches infeasible quickly
