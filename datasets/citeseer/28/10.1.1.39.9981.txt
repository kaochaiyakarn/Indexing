uniform approach programming world wide web luc moreau david university southampton moreau ecs soton ac uk technical report june propose uniform model programming distributed web applications 
model concept web computation places provides mechanisms coordinate distributed computations places including peer peer communication places uniform mechanism initiate computation remote places 
computations interact flow requests responses typically clients proxies servers web architecture 
implemented model global pointers remote service requests provided nexus communication library 
model rationale illustrative examples describe implementation 
web applications require significant amount computation may distributed requires coordination applications web infrastructure advantage constrained architecture fundamentally client server 
section develop key ideas underlying wexus programming model

wexus programming model distributed programming community investigated numerous paradigms communication distributed environments message passing libraries communication channels remote procedure calls rpc object oriented variant remote method invocation :10.1.1.17.6050:10.1.1.134.4847
shall explain wexus nexus programming model extended program www 
wexus extension nexus distributed programming paradigm available library provides programmers key ideas global pointers refer remote objects remote service requests start computations remote places 
addition integrate model web providing mechanism maps transactions remote service requests
