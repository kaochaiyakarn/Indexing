eye movement human computer interaction techniques non command interfaces robert jacob human computer interaction lab naval research laboratory washington user computer dialogues typically sided bandwidth computer user far greater user computer 
movement user eyes provide convenient natural high bandwidth source additional user input help imbalance 
investigate eye movements computer input medium 
emphasis study interaction techniques incorporate eye movements user computer dialogue convenient natural way 
chapter describes research nrl developing interaction techniques broader issues raised non command interaction styles 
discusses human factors technical considerations arise trying eye movements input medium describes approach eye movement interaction techniques devised implemented laboratory reports experiences observations considers eye movement interaction exemplar new general class non command user computer interaction 
distinction subtle user action non voluntary viewed command particularly point view software designer 
key criterion user thinks issuing explicit command 
course possible control eye movements facial expressions gestures misses point non command interface supposed passively observe example user natural eye move ments respond 
essence style non intentional quality 
rich taxonomy adaptive systems view distinction cit vs implicit commands non command really means implicit commands :10.1.1.100.9035
style interface requires invention new interaction techniques helpful user 
inputs non intentional inter carefully avoid annoying user unwanted responses actions 
eye movements called touch problem highly sive interface boon curse 
investigation eye movement interaction techniques described chapter provides example problems attacked
