widespread clusters web increased importance data replication 
existing protocols typical distributed system solutions emphasize fault tolerance price performance database solutions emphasize performance price consistency 
explore data replication cluster configuration objective providing fault tolerance performance compromising consistency 
combining transactional concurrency control group communication primitives 
approach transactions executed site nodes incur overhead parsing optimizing producing results 
database products lazy replication provides fault tolerance full consistency 
suggested ka ka gap combining database replication group communication primitives br mainly total order broadcast ht 
line resulted efficient eager replication protocols guarantee consistency increase fault tolerance 
results especially suitable clusters computers large collections shared databases 
initial optimizations suggested optimistic techniques ps existing protocols major drawbacks :10.1.1.37.7426
amount redundant performed sites 
high abort rates created consistency enforced 
address issues 
protocol minimizes amount redundant system 
total order ensures messages delivered order sites 
regard fault tolerance reliable multicast ensures message delivered available sites 
uniform reliable multicast ensures message delivered site faulty delivered available sites 
assume virtual synchronous system br group members perceive membership view changes virtual time sites deliver exactly messages installing new view 
aggressive version optimistic total order broadcast ps :10.1.1.37.7426
message corresponds transaction 
messages optimistically delivered soon received definitive ordering established 
execution transaction overlap calculation total order 
initial order definitive order transactions simply committed 
messages optimistically delivered soon received definitive ordering established 
execution transaction overlap calculation total order 
initial order definitive order transactions simply committed 
final order different additional actions taken guarantee consistency 
optimistic broadcast defined primitives :10.1.1.37.7426
broadcast broadcast message sites system 
opt deliver delivers message optimistically application order guarantees 
delivers application total order 
means messages opt delivered different order site total order sites 
histories conflict equivalent set transactions order conflicting operations way 
history serializable conflict equivalent serial history bhg 
replicated databases correctness criterion bhg 
criterion copy appear single logical copy execution concurrent transactions equivalent serial execution physical copies 
concurrency control conflict classes :10.1.1.37.7426
conflict class represents partition data 
transactions accessing conflict class high probability conflicts access data transactions different partitions conflict executed concurrently 
transaction access single basic conflict class :10.1.1.37.7426
generalize model allow transactions access compound conflict classes 
criterion copy appear single logical copy execution concurrent transactions equivalent serial execution physical copies 
concurrency control conflict classes :10.1.1.37.7426
conflict class represents partition data 
transactions accessing conflict class high probability conflicts access data transactions different partitions conflict executed concurrently 
transaction access single basic conflict class :10.1.1.37.7426
generalize model allow transactions access compound conflict classes 
compound conflict class non empty set basic conflict classes fc 
assume compound conflict class transaction known advance 
site queue cq associated basic conflict class transaction delivered site added queues basic conflict classes accesses 
queries read transactions executed site snapshot data interfere update transactions 
update transactions broadcast sites executed master site conflict class 
say transaction local master site conflict class remote rest sites 
instance assume sites master conflict class fc master conflict class fc transaction accessing executed transaction accessing executed conflict classes statically assigned sites case failures reassigned different sites 
increasing scalability algorithm extends described fine granularity locking executing transactions site allowing transactions access conflict class :10.1.1.37.7426
characteristics algorithm greatly improves scalability processing capability system increases sites added 
call algorithm non disjoint conflict classes optimistic multicast 
problem considering scalability data replication protocols important keep mind replication nature scale update ratio high 
illustrate point consider centralized system capable processing transactions second
