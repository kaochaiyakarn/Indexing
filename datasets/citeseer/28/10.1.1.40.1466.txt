exploit versions increase concurrency client transactions presence updates 
consider alternative storing versions air older versions broadcast current data client local cache older versions maintained cache local database warehouse client part server database maintained client form multiversion materialized view 
proposed techniques scalable provide consistency direct communication clients server 
performance results show overhead maintaining versions kept low providing considerable increase concurrency

data dissemination broadcast attracted considerable attention due physical support broadcast provided increasingly important class networked environments wireless computing infrastructures including cellular architectures satellite networks 
explosion data intensive applications resulting need scalable means providing information large client populations motivated dramatic improvements global connectivity popularity internet 
systems continue evolve sophisticated client applications require reading current consistent data despite updates server 
current research updates mainly treated context caching :10.1.1.35.7996
