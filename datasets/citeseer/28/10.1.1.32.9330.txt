critical shortcoming framework attempts maximize likelihood state sequence true performance measure interest derivative 
second approach extends constraint satisfaction formalism deal variables associated costs shows model classifier combination problem 
robustness approaches deviations assumptions evaluated 
main methods projection markov models constraint satisfaction classifiers cscl shown perform task predicting np sv phrases cscl method tried tasks

identifying phrase structure inference problem considered formalized identifying phrase structure input string 
input string phrase substring consecutive input symbols external mechanism assumed consistently stochastically annotate substrings phrases goal come mechanism input string identifies phrases string 
identification mechanism works classifiers attempt recognize input string local signals indicative existence phrase 
assume outcome classifier input symbol represented function local context input string aid external information inferred classifiers indicate input symbol inside outside phrase io modeling indicate input symbol opens closes phrase oc modeling combination
