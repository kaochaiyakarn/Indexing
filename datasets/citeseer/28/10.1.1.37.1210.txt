enhanced representation time series allows fast accurate classification clustering relevance feedback keogh michael pazzani department information computer science university california irvine california usa pazzani ics uci edu introduce extended representation time series allows fast accurate classification clustering addition ability explore time series data relevance feedback framework 
representation consists piecewise linear segments represent shape weight vector contains relative importance individual linear segment 
classification context weights learned automatically part training cycle 
relevance feedback context weights determined interactive iterative process users rate various choices 
representation allows user define variety similarity measures tailored specific domains 
demonstrate approach space telemetry medical synthetic data
