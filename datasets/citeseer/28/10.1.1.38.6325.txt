object fusion mediator systems yannis papakonstantinou serge abiteboul hector garcia molina computer science department stanford university stanford ca usa db stanford edu main tasks mediators fuse information heterogeneous information sources 
may involve example removing redundancies resolving inconsistencies favor reliable source 
problem harder sources unstructured semistructured complete knowledge contents structure 
show common fusion operations specified non procedurally succinctly 
key approach assign semantically meaningful object ids objects imported mediator 
semantic ids specify various objects combined merged objects exported mediator 
applications access data directly wrappers may go mediators provide integrated view data exported wrappers

mediators play central role information integration important task perform object fusion 
involves grouping information different sources real world entity possibly removing redundancies resolving inconsistencies page sources favor reliable source 
approach object fusion semantic object identifiers 
basic idea follows 
mediator objects object id fused 
description conceptual objects fused user query arrives mediator 
mediator specification database view 
query arrives sources queried object fragments necessary composing selected fused objects 
specifications msl mediator specification language :10.1.1.35.735
original msl include semantic object id making specification fusion harder 
extend msl semantic object id specified skolem functions allow rules specify object fragments fused 
construction skolem functions extensively studied deductive object oriented database systems community providing clear theoretical foundation 
contribution show single concept object id skolem functions cast appropriate practical framework significantly increases power specification language 
specification language msl intended user language 
matter fact goal simple powerful language constructs 
simplicity turned essential development efficient optimizers execution strategies 
second query processing algorithms optimizations described implemented part tsimmis system 
need sophisticated processing algorithms apparent system built tested techniques developed initial version identified important weaknesses :10.1.1.35.735
third space go full details mainly examples demonstrate power msl fusion problems explain key ideas query decomposition optimization techniques 
precise syntax semantics language 
details underlying algorithms implementation soon ftp available 
outline follows 
general object fusion achieved msl allows rules incrementally independently insert information semantically identified mediator object 
page example assumed source objects semantic key rn fusion 
keys exist represented differently sources 
trivial example report numbers represented integers may represent string format 
case build external predicate converts string format integer map key form semantic id rest examples continue assume matching keys exist keep mind equivalent saying keys converted canonical form :10.1.1.35.735
merging information necessary know structure source reports order fuse 
specification ms demonstrates group information reports tr objects knowing structure contents reports subobjects 
trep rn tr ms report rn rn trep rn tr report rn rn variable binds set values contain subobjects report provided subobjects label rn 
object set value subobject tr object regardless source provides piece information 
note create copies top level tr objects reuse subobjects title 
furthermore copies virtual 
summary section illustrated fusion specified msl 
give additional examples discuss fusion done keys report number aid 
query processing describe mediator specification interpreter processes queries absence object id fusion :10.1.1.35.735
