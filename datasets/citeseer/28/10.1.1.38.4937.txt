unlabeled document collections increasingly common available mining data sets represents major contemporary challenge 
words features text documents represented high dimensional sparse vectors dimensions sparsity typical 
study certain spherical means algorithm clustering document vectors 
algorithm outputs disjoint clusters concept vector centroid cluster normalized unit euclidean norm 
contribution empirically demonstrate owing high dimensionality sparsity text data clusters produced algorithm certain fractal self similar behavior 
clustering useful personalized information delivery providing setup routing new information arriving new scientific publications

starting point applying clustering algorithms unstructured text data create vector space model text data salton mcgill 
basic idea extract unique content bearing words set documents treat words features represent document vector certain weighted word frequencies feature space 
observe may regard vector space model text data set word document matrix rows words columns document vectors 
typically large number words exist moderately sized set documents words common
