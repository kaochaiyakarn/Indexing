chapter research remember said 

reg big time television regret personally ringo project leave just user interface stable 
ample data growth really delve different aspects social information filtering 
involved ringo areas research love explore ffl rigorous analysis algorithms 
due fact ringo project existed months algorithm analysis executed manual human exploration 
believe actual numbers discussed chapter threshold levels kind physical constant 
vary widely depending problem domain volume data particular user base factors 
relatively straightforward matter meta sf algorithm continually testing different parameters find optimal settings possibly select optimal algorithm point time 
may interesting try evolving characteristics social information filtering algorithms genetic algorithms 
fitness functions defined data space extremely structured simple form features amenable genetic algorithms 
ffl virtual users 
ringo currently compares person profile system 
certainly intelligent ways go seeking similar users 
doing comparison user determine methods rapidly finding similar users 
time user entered system normally compute similarity measures nu users system 
similarity measures previous nu system computed 
speed process limiting number profile comparisons 
possible approach call virtual users 
possible particular person reduces linear combination generic tastes error 
virtual user collection generic sub generic profiles user tastes reduced linear combination virtual users 
virtual users continually evolved time 
search space virtual users find best matches new user 
just virtual profiles detail real users form selected virtual profiles 
ffl clustering 
data collected user tastes possible apply clustering artist space find groups related artists 
suspect groups form similarity style similarity quality 
example form group bad artists new kids block vanilla ice pat billy ray lowest rated artists currently ringo mean scores ranging 
reason people rated positively system able distinguish 
time course people rate artist mean scores approach groups quality slowly disappear 
just general interest interesting find kind genres sub genres clustering produces 
greatly speed algorithms helping focus particular search spaces 
example determine particular user likes certain genres limit searches primarily areas 
may compare users respect particular genre 
example particular user recommendations jazz miles profile recommendations pop michael 
knowledge clusters allow kinds queries 
example users able ask recommend artist dead dance recommend heard 
additions greatly enhance ringo functionality user 
ffl emergence 
sf system collects data competent intelligent 
nature emergence needs studied 
kind data needs system various particular tasks 
ffl confidence 
needs done find better indicators reliability particular prediction 
factors commonality number users correlate highly error 
adequate factors determined translate confidence value 
ffl distributed ringo 
ringo stands centralized server 
implemented distributed system 
user agent home machine 
agent communicate agents net looking similar people retrieving information accordingly 
finds agents trusts receive referrals agents agents 
scenario eliminate need centralized server distribute computation different machines 
ffl integration content filtering 
content filtering social information filtering strengths weaknesses 
example mel picking movie chapter demonstrated processes complementary human practice 
computer applications approaches may conjunction greater effect 
far approaches implemented separately soon integration need explored 
ffl avoiding abuse 
individuals groups may enter fictitious users order bias system 
example flood system fictitious users different tastes happen latest album release 
methods detecting dealing violations need developed 
chapter seek truth matter gets hurt 
truth dare bottom line social information filtering works general approach information filtering
