describes query processor lore dbms semistructured data focuses particularly cost query optimization techniques developed implemented semistructured environment 
usual problems associated cost query optimization apply semistructured data number additional problems arise di erent query execution strategies di erent semistructured databases complicated notions database statistics novel uses indexing 
exible logical query plans transformed wide variety plans de ne appropriate database statistics cost model describe plan enumeration including heuristics reducing search space

value index supports nding atomic objects incoming edge label satisfying predicate 
label index allows locate parents object edge label 
edge index term supports nding parent child object pairs connected speci ed labeled edge 
full text index supports nding atomic string values match information retrieval style pattern 
addition indexes lore dataguide gw provides functionality path index pindex :10.1.1.15.9610:10.1.1.15.9610
