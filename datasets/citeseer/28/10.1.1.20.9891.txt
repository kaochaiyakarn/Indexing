paths xml data algebraic framework xml query evaluation number introduces algebraic framework expressing evaluating queries xml data 
presents underlying assumptions framework describes input output algebraic operators defines operators semantics 
evaluates framework regard proposed xml query algebras 
examples show framework flexible capture queries expressed quilt dominant xml query languages 
algebra context internet query engine formulate logical plans xml ql queries 
define equivalence rules provide opportunities optimization give example cases point usefulness rules 
contribution formal query algebra xml data

algebraic framework modifying system support quilt crf :10.1.1.37.8206
goal project build internet query engine combining xml query processing text context search engine functionality treating search engine powerful access method 
proposed algebraic representation query extract complex text context retrieval operations issue directly search engine retrieving relevant data algebraic operators filter data
