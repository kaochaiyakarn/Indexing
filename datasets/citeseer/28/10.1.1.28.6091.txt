furthermore active rules take form event driven data driven rules 
data driven production rules declarative event driven rules describe firing situation exact definition way situation detected 
henceforth call production deductive rules collectively declarative rules due declarative nature condition 
event driven event condition action eca rules procedural explicitly define activation 
rule types useful active kbs event driven rules needed mainly implementing time constrained applications extensions database system data driven rules useful monitoring database states enforcing integrity constraints deductive rules useful define maintain recursive materialized views database system :10.1.1.53.6941
relational systems support rule types oodb systems 
extensible object oriented kbs called device extensible data driven event driven rule integration complex events integrates production deductive rules active oodb generically supports event driven rules 
integration compilation condition declarative rule types discrimination network consists simple complex events record combine database modifications possibly rule fire

active oodb systems support production deductive rules addition eca rules system best knowledge supports rule types 
ode supports eca rules triggers production rules constraints primitive triggers explicitly evoked member functions relevant constraints checked time object accessed 
notion incremental condition checking 
chimera prototype extension adam exact oodb support deductive rules production rules respectively translating high level rule set eca rules technique described ceri widom :10.1.1.53.6941
approach simpler certain drawbacks delay propagating effects object deletion due re derivation previously derived objects 
furthermore performance comparison approach showed cases bulk data loading value joins device faster approach better joins object 
relational database systems hand support multiple rule types 
example ariel supports production rules efficiently matched special discrimination network treat built scratch 
example relational system re uses primitives system relational tables low level approach perform rule condition matching 
support traditional eca rules

described extends significantly previous generalizing semantics production rules declarative rules truth maintenance techniques 
creates general framework new rule types added seamlessly system deductive rules rules derived aggregate attributes 
furthermore device provides extensible rule type hierarchy rule types organized properly managed 
high level rule translated eca rules triggered different event derived single condition element condition high level rule 
condition eca rule condition high level rule minus event 
example rule translated eca rules ea ec case deductive rules monitoring deletion objects required keep database consistent 
events da db dc monitor deletion corresponding data items eca rules needed 
furthermore approach requires rule check re derive deleted derived objects due possible alternative derivations deletion prevented incorporating check deletion rules :10.1.1.53.6941
device hand require check re derivation uses counter mechanism accounts multiply derived objects 
analyze disadvantages rule translation approach 
maintenance 
wants delete temporarily disable production rule perform operation related eca rules 
way significant reduction number production cycles rule execution time achieved demonstrated performance section 
noted semantics rule execution regarding conflict resolution slightly changed due set oriented nature rule execution 
specifically case arise rule waits conflict set long time promoted executed due single update 

system performance section measure performance deductive rule execution device compare approach :10.1.1.53.6941
tests definition path derived class example similar example

redundant condition checking joins computed larger sets instances approach explains device approach pre selects instances tests rule condition 
table shows performance deletions single arc causes deletion paths alternative derivations paths length arcs 
set oriented approach faster deletion path length exist anti actions executed single production cycle table 
approach significantly slower orders magnitude 
propagation deletion arcs paths paths shouldn really deleted deleted :10.1.1.53.6941
shown table production cycles approach shown order delete re derive insert 
counter approach device avoids unnecessary deletion re derivation costs 
noticeable advantage device deletion time deletion paths scale size database search path objects ones thessaloniki 
approach hand scales rapidly due increasing complexity road network associated deletions re derivations
