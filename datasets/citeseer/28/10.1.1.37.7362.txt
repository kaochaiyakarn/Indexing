generating hard satisfiability problems bart selman david mitchell hector levesque report results large scale experiments satisfiability testing 
observed testing satisfiability random formulas appears surprisingly easy 
show right distribution instances appropriate parameter values possible generate random formulas hard satisfiability testing quite difficult 
results provide benchmark evaluation satisfiability testing procedures 
artificial intelligence 
computational tasks interest ai extent precisely characterized shown np hard general form 
evaluate empirical results danger biasing sample suit procedure question simply easy problems 
empirical results showing random instances satisfiability generated way easy hard sets instances particular sat procedure anyway predictable advance 
care robustness procedures develop want consider performance wide spectrum examples 
easy cases solved reasonable method hard cases ultimately separate winners losers 
data challenging test material developers sat procedures see selman example :10.1.1.34.6853
sat procedure tests davis putnam procedure describe 
believe choice reasons basically variant resolution widely general reasoning method ai second empirical sat testing refinement method facilitates comparison 
suspect results hard easy areas generalize sat procedures 
rest organized follows
