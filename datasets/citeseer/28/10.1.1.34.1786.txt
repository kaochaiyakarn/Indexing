managing operator ordering problem parallel databases department information technology university austria email uni ac focuses parallel query optimization 
consider operator problem introduce new class execution strategies called linear oriented bushy trees lbt 
compared related approach general bushy trees gbt significant complexity reduction operator ordering problem derived theoretically demonstrated experimentally compared lbts authorize optimization time improvement reach loosing quality 
demonstrate existing commercial parallel query optimizers need little extension modifications order handle lbts 
key words parallel databases parallel query optimization linear oriented bushy trees extending existing optimizers 
modern database applications data mining decision support pose new challenges query optimization processing 
operator ordering problem search optimal ordering respect cost function 
search space spawn operator orderings parallel databases restrictions extremely large way join relational query participating relations number possible orderings low bounded delta 
context high complexity early works restricted search orderings allowing inter operator parallelism 
exploitation inter operator parallelism shown effective case high performance parallel machines 
works managed search complexity applying randomized search heuristics :10.1.1.31.737
methods low cost partitions search space accessed 
navigation randomly locally advantageous moves accepted allowing access global low cost strategies 
acceptable complex database applications 
navigating blindly search space propose consider subspace called linear oriented bushy trees lbt
