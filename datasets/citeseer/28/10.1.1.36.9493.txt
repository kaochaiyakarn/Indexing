revisiting structured storage transactional record store robert michael swift henry levy university washington cs washington edu uw cse increasing number applications electronic mail servers web servers personal information managers handle large amounts homogeneous data 
data ectively represented records manipulated simple operations record reading writing searching 
unfortunately modern storage systems inappropriate needs applications 
side le systems store unstructured data byte strings limited reliability guarantees 
side relational databases store structured data provide concurrency control transactions relational databases slow complex dicult manage applications 
presents transactional record store directly addresses needs modern applications 
internet applications exhibit fairly simple workloads 
task sequentially access small number data sources example user browses descriptions server processes customer order 
result perform relatively simple set operations read modify search small records 
applications typically require replication availability reliability

currently application choices le systems databases fails meet application needs dimensions 
file systems typically store unstructured data provide limited failure atomicity making ill suited reliably storing large numbers homogeneous records 
object stores relational databases manage objects records respectively provide concurrency control reliability transactions
