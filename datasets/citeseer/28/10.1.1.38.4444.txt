role children teachers design process believe children play important role creating new technologies children :10.1.1.78.7430
established interdisciplinary intergenerational team researchers include computer scientists educational researchers visual artists biologists elementary school children ages classroom teachers 
research process looked methods diverse points view enable voice heard design process 
research activities come understand impact children design children digital libraries come understand new technologies impact children users 
developed worked children different ways different locations 
past years research team developing new technology design methodologies support children role design partners 
strategy working children partners come call cooperative inquiry 
combines adapts low tech prototyping children adults collaborating design partners hci lab participatory design observation note techniques contextual inquiry time resources technology immersion 
children adults alike gather field data initiate ideas test develop new prototypes reflect writing journals 
pursue projects write papers create new technologies :10.1.1.110.4624
