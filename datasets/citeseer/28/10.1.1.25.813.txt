mixed initiative interfaces learning tasks smartedit talks back steven lau pedro domingos daniel weld department computer science engineering university washington box seattle washington cs washington edu applications machine learning viewed interactions teacher provides training examples student learns generalization training examples 
application great interest iui community adaptive user interfaces 
traditional learning interface scope teacher student interactions consists solely teacher user providing number training examples student learner testing learned model new examples 
active learning approaches go step traditional interaction model allow student propose new training examples solved teacher 
propose interfaces machine learning closely resemble human teacher student relationships 
teacher time attention precious resources 
traditional applications machine learning involve users domain experts provide label training examples primitive ways 
systems operate batches examples provide request feedback learning process 
communication user learning system provision batch examples test system batch examples 
experience research shows great bene ts realized machine learning applications rich user interfaces 
active learning shown just allowing system pick example label greatly reduce number examples user need consider :10.1.1.119.2797

case study smartedit machine learning application bene ts mixed initiative discourse programming demonstration user demonstrates system perform task 
system treats demonstration partial execution trace program solves task generalizes trace original program 
prior formulated programming demonstration pbd inductive learning problem :10.1.1.34.4806:10.1.1.34.4806
formulation learner sequence changes application state observed user performs task concrete example 
learner generalizes program capable performing task new examples learning functions transform initial application state desired nal state 
actual learning mechanism involves maintaining compact representation set candidate hypotheses learning include hypotheses consistent observed task
