hyperlink page represents implicit endorsement page pointed 
ffl hyperlink text hyperlink text normally title brief summary target page :10.1.1.137.5638
ffl keywords keywords extracted full text documents 
ffl page title title tag valid head section defines title html document 
ffl text different font emphasized text usually different font highlight importance 
ffl sentence sentence document give crucial information related document 
approach identifying important types web pages topic ffl authorities provide best source information topic ffl hubs provide collections links authorities 
example professional basketball information official national basketball association site www com considered authority site www com hub 
authorities hubs top ranking search results find related web pages 
analyzing interconnections series related pages identify authorities hubs particular topic 
simple method update nonnegative authority weight nonnegative hub weight :10.1.1.137.5638

ad hoc methods include hyperlink vector voting method system 
method uses content hyperlinks document rank relevance query terms system studies structural relationships nodes returned content query gives highest ranking highly connected nodes 
ffl indexing modification feedback users system administrators modify unrelated document terms render unrelated related query 
data clustering data clustering improve search results dividing data set data clusters 
data cluster contains objects high similarity clusters produced group documents relevant user query separately irrelevant ones 
clustering web resource smaller separate query results 
suffix tree clustering stc algorithm phrases shared documents create clusters :10.1.1.136.7906
clustering search results proposed similarity function cluster similar queries contents user logs 
resulting clusters provide useful information frequently asked queries faq identification

current search engines able cover web comprehensively 
individual search engine may critical information provided engines 
metasearch engines conduct search search engines simultaneously results sort integrated format :10.1.1.21.3137:10.1.1.28.1932
lets users see glance particular search engine returned best results query having search individually 
typically web indexes 
shows system structure metasearch engine consists major components ffl dispatch determines search engines specific query sent 
selection usually network local computational resources long term performance search engines specific query terms 
mediator provides users integrated access multiple heterogeneous data sources wrapper represents access specific data source 
maps query general mediator format specific wrapper format specific search engine 
metasearch engines rely documents summaries returned standard search engines 
standard search engines give unbiased results distort metasearch results 
nec research institute neci metasearch engine solves problem downloading analyzing document displaying results show query term context :10.1.1.43.7836
helps users readily determine document relevant having download page 
authors pilot noticed thousands specialized topic specific search engines accessible web topic specific engines return far better results topic queries standard search engines 
pilot dynamically routes user query appropriate specialized search engines methods neighborhood topic identification ii query expansion 


sql approaches learning new language normally task users 
new system uses familiar language usually adopted relatively smoothly users 
sql structured query language known widely database language 
sql approaches view world wide web huge database record matches web page sql languages support effective flexible query processing :10.1.1.56.5824
typical sql language syntax query select attribute list domain specifications search conditions query examples explain language 
sql example find pages world wide web consortium site pages fewer bytes 
select url www org bytes url page url page attributes bytes keywords text 
sql example find educational pages containing keyword database select url edu database keywords regular expressions widely language wild card matching string 
advent multimedia added audio graphics images video types data web 
multimedia search engines available currently name keyword matching keywords entered web reviewers automatic indexing 
reason low number contentbased multimedia search engines mainly due difficulty automated multimedia indexing 
numerous multimedia indexing methods literature meet efficiency requirements web multimedia searches expect prompt response search huge volume web multimedia data 
content image video search engines available line :10.1.1.44.5886:10.1.1.45.8031
various indexing methods applied locate desirable images video 
major technologies include camera object motion colors examples locations positional color texture shapes sketches text texture relevance feedback 
de facto web image video search engine reach system key component image video collection indexing fully au practicable 
similarly effective web audio search engines constructed audio information retrieval considered difficult challenges multimedia retrieval
