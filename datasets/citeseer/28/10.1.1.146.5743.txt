new customers asked fill form classification information asked initializes models exploiting stereotypical information 
retrieves domain dependent knowledge users stereotype kb contains hierarchical taxonomy stereotypes clustering properties homogeneous customer groups 
user features modeled specific sales domain defined store configuration time new virtual store created stereotype kb defined dedicated configuration tool generates template create user models interactions 
stereotype kb may contain description multiple market segmentations called stereotype families 
family describes features characteristic customer classes stereotypes belonging 
stereotype families represent orthogonal segmentations population describe customers different viewpoints example prototype defined families concerning users domain expertise life style destination items purchase distinguish home business involving different preferences product properties 
stereotype families exploit partially overlapping classificatory data predictions different user preferences personality traits 
user classified independently family stereotypical predictions merged initialize user model 
representation formalism user models includes descriptive predictive part 
descriptive part stores data explicitly asked user classify stereotypical user classes information user needs 
predictive part contains information user features inferred system exploiting stereotypical information

predictive part user model concerns personality traits preferences 
personality traits tailor descriptions user include receptivity amount information able acquire domain expertise technical interest interest aesthetic information 
preferences represent user attitudes product properties ease suggest items suited 
formalism introduced torasso console personality traits preferences represented parameters structured follows personality traits importance slot parameter name importance values value probability pairs developments system include dynamic user modeling techniques described update user models basis user behavior product selections

importance slot takes values range represents importance property user
