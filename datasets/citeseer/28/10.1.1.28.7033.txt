choices join methods expanded distributed systems example semi joins may provide improved performance 
costing plans order compare plans optimizer needs assign cost function 
original distributed rdbms prototypes distributed ingres cost function typically resource consumption distributed ingres allowed plans optimized response time 
communication costs assumed dominate local processing costs leading fairly simplistic cost models 
reasonably accurate cost models developed query pro cessing algorithms :10.1.1.108.3178
cost models depend parameters difficult estimate selectivity predicates 
particular join predicates sub queries correlated conjunctive predicates difficult estimate accurately 
contemporary optimizers statistics guess parameters 
unfortunately errors accumulate rapidly join degree queries
