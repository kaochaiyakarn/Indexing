concurrent language shared prolog antonio paolo ciancarini dipartimento di informatica universit di pisa shared prolog new concurrent logic language 
shared prolog system composed set parallel agents prolog programs extended guard mechanism 
programmer controls granularity parallelism coordinating communication synchronization agents centralized data structure 
communication mechanism inherited blackboard model problem solving 
intuitively granularity logic processes elaborated parallel large resources shared blackboard fine grained 
operational semantics shared prolog terms distributed model 
communication channels processes shared streams bi directional channels data items flow 
novel approach concurrent logic programming 
main idea define logic framework communication mechanism inherited blackboard model problem solving 
blackboard model taken basic framework modeling coordination separate logic processes 
model projects instance linda concurrent imperative programming language agora problem developing heterogeneous parallel programs addressed :10.1.1.113.9679
similarity fp parallel functional language communication primitives unification 
shared prolog language sp short exploits mechanisms coordination communication inherited blackboard model extending unification powerful mechanism pattern matching linda 
shared prolog provided truly concurrent operational semantics describing sp system set sequential processes possibly located different places cooperating derivation goal semantical point view global state global clock assumed 
behavior concurrent system represented causal relations components distributed state
