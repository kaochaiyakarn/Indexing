age information evident quite clearly newspapers information source 
nearly north america dozen newspapers delivered hundreds new articles day 
nearly world world wide web access daily newspapers online web sites providing tens thousands news articles potential interest 
need information filters help prioritize news articles may spend time reading articles interest 
newspaper filters additional opportunity personalization shown strong appeal newspaper readers 
practical considerations prevented hard copy newspapers obtaining degree personal customization online newspapers subject constraints printed matter

attempts customization newspapers filtering lambda appears acm sigir workshop recommender systems implementation evaluation august berkeley ca usa 
newspapers attempts completely countered weaknesses human computer filters 
humans computers need help filtering information 
everyday filtering done human critics 
read book reviews decide books read 
listen movie critics decide movies watch 
count number rating stars deciding restaurant eat 
humans generally smart deciding information slow compared amount information requires filtering 
power connectivity computers allowed computers applied problem filtering information 
mechanical filters keyword searching artificial intelligence filters natural language processing attempted apply power computers problem prioritizing information 
computers fast processing information generally stupid relative humans comes making meaningful decisions information content 
collaborative filtering applies speed computers intelligence humans 
collaborative filtering technique peer opinions predict interest 
users indicate opinions form ratings various pieces information collaborative filter correlates ratings users determine predictions rater 
addition collaborative filter shares ratings users making predictions 
early tapestry grouplens applied collaborative filtering email usenet news respectively :10.1.1.136.4322

today collaborative filtering systems recommend books restaurants collaborative filtering system jokes 
collaborative filtering prove ineffective reasons ffl early rater problem 
pure collaborative filtering provide prediction item appears users ratings base predictions 
early predictions item inaccurate ratings base predictions 
similarly established system provide poor predictions new user enters system 
extreme case early rater problem collaborative filtering system begins user suffers early rater problem item 
ffl sparsity problem 
information domains number items far exceeds individual hope absorb matrices containing ratings items users sparse 
relatively dense information filtering domains sparse making hard find documents rated people base collaborative filtering predictions 
ffl gray sheep 
small medium community users individuals benefit pure collaborative filtering systems opinions consistently agree disagree group people 
individuals rarely receive accurate collaborative filtering predictions initial start phase user system 
enter pure content filtering 
pure content filter recommends items solely profile built analyzing content items user rated 
pure content filters newspapers include 
content filter analyzes items rated individual user uses content items provided ratings build profile compare non rated items recommend additional items interest 
content filters affected problems pure collaborative filters techniques apply documents 
example filter predicts high interest articles word clinton give prediction read article 
despite strengths content filters prove ineffective 
humans content techniques difficulty distinguishing high quality low quality information topic 
number items grows number items content category increases decreasing effectiveness content approaches 
experiments shown collaborative filtering systems enhanced adding content filters :10.1.1.110.9766
combination content collaborative filters realize benefits content filters include early predictions cover items users gaining benefits accurate collaborative filtering predictions number users ratings increases 
filtering approaches utilized combined content collaborative filters grouplens implements hybrid collaborative filtering system usenet news supports content filters users 
evaluate new articles soon published enter ratings documents 
collaborative filtering system treats ordinary user enters ratings

content filter content filtering algorithms match article keywords keywords user profile 
briefly describe format user profile required calculation content prediction give details keyword generation lastly describe matching function 
user profile divided sections corresponding tango newspaper business sports 
information sources sections mapped usenet news groups web server volumes 
users explicitly indicate preference articles sections marking checkboxes particular section 
addition users specify explicit keywords section 
example user may select section sports enter keyword indicate interest sports articles general high interest denver sports articles 
profile section contains list implicit keywords populated appending keywords articles user high rating currently top quartile range ratings current list implicit keywords 
explicit interest indicators newspaper section explicit keywords enable content filter direct learning predicting article interest 
direct learning provides predictable behavior user precise defining user interest requires lot manual effort order achieve accurate predictions 
users required enter newspaper section explicit keywords order utilize content filter 
implicit interest indicator implicit keywords enables content filter indirect learning predicting interest absence despite explicit interest indicators 
indirect learning require extensive user effort may potentially useful content information capture non useful content information 
generate keywords article remove words perform word stemming 
keywords selected frequency count words assuming occurrence words article furnishes useful measurement word significance 
compute degree match article keywords keywords user profile overlap coefficient formula jd jdj jqj set keywords extracted article set keywords user profile 
coefficient influenced sizes desirable number article keywords larger keywords user explicit keyword list smaller keywords user implicit keyword list 
predictions interest indicators explicit keywords implicit keywords newspaper section combined matching functions article keywords section 
determine appropriate weights content match extensive user studies give equal weight combine produce single content prediction 
weight individual component allow high indication interest components override 
example user checked sports section interest strong implicit explicit keyword matches sections sports articles preference 
business article strong implicit explicit keyword match receive preference general sports article
