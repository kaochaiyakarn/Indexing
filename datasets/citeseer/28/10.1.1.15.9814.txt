briefly describes novel user interface design methods developed applied project 

tatami system design motivated main goals verify distributed concurrent software provide distributed environment cooperative produce proofs easier read 
proofs written way extremely simple illustrations formal proof methods proofs genuine mathematical interest 
simplest fully formal proofs practically impossible comprehend 
unfortunately exactly kind proofs produced mechanical theorem provers 
order improve situation suggest motivation structure proofs explicit relevant background tutorial material integrated proofs 
recommendations follow ideas cognitive psychology semiotics discussed section :10.1.1.19.210
particular structure tatami system proof websites designed algebraic semiotics combines algebraic specification social semiotics sense 
extension revision reported papers 
particular focuses system architecture user interface issues convenience interested readers bibliography attempts list papers produced project including concerning aspects underlying formal logic
