adaptive penalty approach constrained genetic algorithm optimization khaled rasheed department computer science rutgers state university new jersey new brunswick nj usa cs rutgers edu describe new adaptive penalty approach handling constraints genetic algorithm optimization problems 
idea start relatively small penalty coefficient increase decrease demand optimization progresses 
empirical results engineering design domains demonstrate merit proposed approach 
genetic algorithms gas goldberg search algorithms mimic behavior natural selection 
gas attempt find best solution problem maximum function generating collection population potential solutions individuals problem 
mutation recombination crossover operations better solutions hopefully generated current set potential solutions
