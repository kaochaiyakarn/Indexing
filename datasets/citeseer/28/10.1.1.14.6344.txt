characteristic existing information gathering systems central agent systems 
examine features complex information carrying environments information gathering task demonstrate utility viewing information gathering distributed problem solving di culties viewing distributed processing 
propose new approach information gathering distributed problem solving paradigm research agent systems distributed arti cial intelligence 
approach called cooperative information gathering involves concurrent asynchronous discovery composition information spread network information servers 
example uncertainty arise incomplete local information reduced detection subsequent exploitation overlaps subsumes interrelationships 
process involves providing agent complete global view entails communication costs 
agent communicate relevant portions local view problem solving process help form coherent view emerging global problem solving process agents 
partial solutions meta information received agents may lend support local solution may point inconsistency agent local processing

subproblems overlap communication agents may reduce amount redundant performed reduce time required achieve global solution 
may case solution partial solution generated agent may facilitate serve focus constrain problem solving agent reduce amount computation required 
problem solving process agent way assists agent problem solving making agent certain local solution restricting space potential solutions considered
