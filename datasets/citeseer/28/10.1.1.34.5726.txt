open electronic marketplace agent workflows software research development center dept computer engineering middle east technical university turkey edu tr propose electronic marketplace architecture called commerce processes marketplace modeled adaptable agent workflows 
higher level abstraction provided workflow technology customization electronic commerce processes different users possible 
agent implementation hand provides highly reusable component workflow architecture negotiation ability capability adapt dynamic changes environment 
agent communication handled knowledge query manipulation language kqml 
workflow architecture possible complete modeling electronic commerce processes allowing involved parties able invoke existing applications define new tasks restructure control data flow tasks create custom built process definitions 
proposed architecture data exchanges realized extensible markup language xml providing uniformity simplicity highly open interoperable architecture 
number propose counter propose messages exchanged task agents seller buyer sides agreement reached 
negotiation task agents know offer determine negotiation 
attributes may negotiated sides price deadline delivery time multi issue multi party negotiation algorithm item negotiation 
negotiation model raiffa bilateral parties issue negotiation raiffa 
bilateral negotiation model transformed parties issues negotiation model set mutually influencing parties issues negotiations faratin :10.1.1.105.3046
type negotiation called integrative bargaining 
sequence offers counter offers party negotiation called negotiation thread 
offers counter offers generated linear combinations simple functions called tactics 
term strategy denote way agent changes weights different tactics time 
element model relative importance agent assigns issue negotiation 
weights normalized sum weights issue 
elements agent scoring function contract defined sum scores issue multiplied weight 
order prepare counter offer offer negotiation thread agent uses set tactics generate new values variable negotiation set 
different families tactics needs business process applications developed faratin resource dependent behaviour dependent :10.1.1.105.3046
tactics set functions compute value issue considering single criterion 
set values issues range function single criteria time resource domain 
agents may want consider criterion compute value single issue achieved generating counter proposals weighted combination different tactics covering set criteria 
order determine best course action result agreement contract maximizes scoring function agent utilizes strategy 
buyers sellers identified negotiation starts 
phase shown 
item negotiation performed negotiation task agents sides 
negotiation process seller side initiated external interest event sent negotiation task agent buyer 
negotiation process realized multi party multi attribute negotiation scheme described faratin suggested propose kqml messages sorry accept kqml message :10.1.1.105.3046
agreement reached payment processes scheduled sides 
task agent responsible doing payment buyer side gets user preference payment type credit card site related information credit card number 
user interaction agent contacts interface agent buyer 
task agent sends information seller side task agent activates payment process
