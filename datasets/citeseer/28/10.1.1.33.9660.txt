ant colony control autonomous decentralized shop floor routing vincent stephen smith robotics institute carnegie mellon university forbes avenue pittsburgh pa cs cmu edu introduce new approach autonomous decentralized shop floor routing 
system call ant colony control ac applies analogy colony ants foraging food problem dynamic shop floor routing 
system artificial ants indirect communication shop routing decisions altering reacting dynamically changing common environment simulated pheromone trails 
simple factory layouts show emergent behavior colony comparable optimal routing strategy 
furthermore complexity factory layout increased show adaptive behavior ac evolves local decision making policies lead near optimal solutions standpoint global performance 

properly matched dispatch policies give rise quite efficient performance susceptibility myopic globally suboptimal decisionmaking recognized 
machine learning genetic programming communities attempted address problem 
train neural network representation dispatch policy reinforcement learning techniques incorporating global information tardiness jobs reward function 
applies genetic programming problem defining fitness dispatch policy terms global performance 
number agent approaches take decentralized view shop floor control :10.1.1.54.7158
various forms agent coordination approaches attempt attain coherent global performance means local decision making 
popular agent negotiation paradigms decentralized approaches scheduling include contract net protocol auction protocols market approaches 
evidence market approaches produce globally optimal near optimal solutions 
wellman show discrete resource allocation problems equilibrium solution optimal solution
