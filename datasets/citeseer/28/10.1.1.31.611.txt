media lab perceptual computing learning common sense technical report nov coupled hidden markov models complex action recognition matthew brand oliver alex pentland brand sandy media mit edu vision modeling group mit media lab cambridge ma usa algorithms coupling training hidden markov models hmms model interacting processes demonstrate superiority conventional hmms vision task classifying handed actions 
hmms successful framework perceptual computing modeling classifying dynamic behaviors popular offer dynamic time warping training algorithm clear bayesian semantics 
markovian framework strong restrictive assumptions system generating signal single process having small number states extremely limited state memory 
single process model inappropriate vision speech applications resulting low model performance 
coupled hmms provide efficient way resolve problems offer superior training speeds model likelihoods robustness initial conditions
