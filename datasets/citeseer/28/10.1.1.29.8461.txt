autonomous agents operating complex dynamic environments need ability integrate robust plan execution higher level reasoning 
describes combine low level navigation techniques drawn mobile robotics deliberation techniques drawn intelligent agents 
particular discuss combination navigation system fuzzy logic deliberator belief desire intention bdi model 
discuss subtleties involved integration illustrate example 
milou robot works food factory 
agent simply maintain intention adopted stopping reconsider 
time time necessary check example intention achieved believed longer achievable 
situations necessary agent deliberate intentions necessary change focus dropping existing intentions adopting new ones 
clearly agent intention reconsideration policy affect performance optimal policy agent heavily dependent environment 
certain amount problem area intelligent agents formal experimental perspective :10.1.1.104.9541:10.1.1.34.3464
concentrated agents environments simple compared environment milou operates 
knowledge attempts investigate intention reconsideration environments complex dynamic 
research aims address deficit identifying suitable mechanisms strategies intention reconsideration combined kind low level control mechanisms required agents operate complex dynamic environments 
describes approach combines robust navigation system fuzzy logic bdi system handling intentions 
description little assuming single action achieve intention close reality implemented bdi systems 
instance prs works achieve intentions pulling pre compiled plans plan library 
mobile robots require sophisticated planners particular planners plan robustly considerable uncertainty real world mobile robots subject 
second issue deliberate act 
experimental problem concentrated relationship speed change environment frequency :10.1.1.104.9541:10.1.1.34.3464
situation subtle considerable effort expended trying achieve intention longer trying pass closed door outside milou circle forever necessary able detect failure plan execution 
third need handle uncertainty milou view world 
formal model assumes boolean beliefs milou believes door open believes closed reality complex 
milou degree belief sensor input door open closed
