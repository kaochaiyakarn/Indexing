user centered design evaluation real time battlefield visualization virtual environment deborah hix edward swan ii joseph mike mcgee jim durbin tony king virginia polytechnic institute state university va naval research laboratory washington virtual prototyping simulation technologies va increasing power computers hardware rendering systems date primarily motivated creation visually rich perceptually realistic virtual environment applications 
comparatively little effort expended user interaction components ves 
result user interfaces poorly designed rarely evaluated users 
usability engineering newly emerging facet development user centered design usability evaluation ves practice lags far needed 
framework supports methodology evaluating different travel techniques appropriately matching travel techniques virtual applications 
aspects quality factors identified important travel speed accuracy spatial awareness ease learning information gathering presence user comfort 
authors acknowledge task related factors task environment user system characteristics greater impact quality factor performance travel technique selected 
evaluation methodology described intended generalizable variety ves 
discuss usability engineering methods shaped iterative development designed ing students various concepts associated newton laws physics :10.1.1.41.5786
goal design process develop usable educational virtual world 
authors applied usability evaluation identify refine early system weaknesses premises usability learning learning vs usability 
potential users high school students experts field physics professors participated formative evaluations resulted changes improved final user interaction 
research reported limited element usability evaluation includes study haptic interfaces investigation spatial input devices 
exo centric navigation worked globally manipulating environment conducting operations large scale units 
small scale operations users wanted fly capability 
logical approach designing dragon ego centric flying capability 
mapping flightstick buttons navigation tasks shown table trigger left button pressed simultaneously produced combined pan zoom trigger right button produced combined heading pitch worked users 
designing second iteration point go framework usability characteristics ves see section suggest various possibilities ego centric navigation metaphor design wim eye hand :10.1.1.41.5786
ultimately designed point go metaphor attempted avoid having different modes buttons different navigation tasks pan zoom known usability problems interaction 
decision person navigates object location real world point look go move 
reasoning adopting idea ego centric navigation simplify design loosely mimic real world 
iteration user simply pointed flightstick location object interest pressed trigger fly
