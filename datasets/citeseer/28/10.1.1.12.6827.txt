empirical study automated dictionary construction information extraction domains ellen riloff department computer science university utah salt lake city ut primary goal natural language processing researchers develop knowledge natural language processing nlp system portable domains 
knowledge nlp systems rely domain specific dictionary concepts represents substantial knowledge engineering bottleneck 
developed system called autoslog addresses knowledge engineering bottleneck task called information extraction 
autoslog automatically creates domain specific dictionaries information extraction appropriate training corpus 
describe experiments autoslog additional domains joint ventures microelectronics 
compare performance autoslog domains discuss lessons learned generality approach results experiments demonstrate novice users generate effective dictionaries autoslog 
portability crucial concern researchers knowledge natural language processing nlp 
knowledge nlp systems typically rely conceptual dictionary manually encoded specific domain 
knowledge systems performed certain tasks systems practical real world applications knowledge need acquired automatically :10.1.1.34.9473
