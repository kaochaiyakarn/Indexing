cooperative box pushing mission offers simple straight forward illustration key characteristic alliance architecture fault tolerant adaptive control due dynamic changes robot team 
box pushing mission requires long box pushed room box sufficiently heavy long robot push middle box move room 
box pushed ends order accomplish mission 
synchronize pushing ends mission defined terms recurring tasks push little left push little right activated time opposite side just pushed 
robots remain aligned pushing 
illustrates genghis ii pushing 
reduced rate pushing genghis ii added caused 
ffi slow ffi slow genghis ii parameters differ quite bit genghis ii slower pushing box 
note described parameter differences easily learned robots features alliance architecture allow robots monitor learn performance robot team members :10.1.1.105.1891
explained mechanism just assume impatience rates assigned human designer ffi slow genghis ii ffi slow 
mind assume pushing left box genghis ii swapped team right box 
genghis ii takes longer complete pushing old sensory feedback remaining push left motivational behavior satisfied frequently push left behavior set activated frequently 
push right motivational behavior remaining impatient activate push right behavior set hearing robot accomplishing task 
control mechanism alliance designed facilitate fault tolerant cooperation allows robots recover failures individual robots communication system adapt action selection due changes robot team membership changes dynamic environment
