rank aggregation methods web dwork ravi kumar naor consider problem combining ranking results various sources 
context web main applications include building meta search engines combining ranking functions selecting documents multiple criteria improving search precision word associations 
develop set techniques rank aggregation problem compare performance known methods 
primary goal design rank aggregation techniques ectively combat spam serious problem web searches 
experiments show methods simple cient ective 
keywords rank aggregation ranking functions metasearch multi word queries spam 
fairly obvious reasons ranking algorithm considered broadly acceptable search engine su ciently comprehensive coverage web 
issues somewhat deeper 
firstly question spam manipulation authors web pages attempt achieve high rank 
single ranking function trusted perform queries 
years ago query term frequency single main heuristic ranking web pages uential kleinberg brin page link analysis come powerful technique ranking web pages hyperlinked documents :10.1.1.120.3875:10.1.1.120.3875:10.1.1.109.4049:10.1.1.109.4049
heuristics added including anchor text analysis page structure headers analysis keyword listings url text motivated heuristics exploit wealth information prone manipulation parties 
secondly world governed frequently changing commercial interests alliances clear users form protection biases interests individual search engines 
case point note paid placement paid inclusion see appear gaining popularity search engines 
cases individual ranking functions inadequate fundamental reason data ranked simply amenable simple ranking functions 
enhancements heuristics heuristics combining rankings motivated underlying principle 
example borda method idea wins better 
gives gure merit candidate 
natural extend say wins players better iteratively re ne ordering produced heuristic 
context web searching hits algorithm kleinberg pagerank algorithm brin page motivated similar considerations :10.1.1.120.3875:10.1.1.120.3875:10.1.1.109.4049:10.1.1.109.4049
see chains propose natural extensions precise sense borda method sorting geometric mean sorting majority 
computational ciency general setting markov chains determining stationary probability distribution takes time 
practice explicitly compute transition matrix time iterations power method allow compute stationary distribution 
fact suggest faster method practical purposes 
illustrate scheme section examine performance methods 
aggregating ranking functions collection documents problem indexing store documents manner search term relevant search term retrieved easily 
classic information retrieval problem reasonably understood static documents see 
documents hypertext documents indexing algorithms exploit latent relationship documents implied 
web approach proved tremendously successful :10.1.1.120.3875
common technique indexing construct ranking function 
respect query function operate ways give absolute score document indicating relevance document query score ii take documents rank order respect query 
underlying methodology competing ranking functions obtained 
instance term counting yields simple ranking function
