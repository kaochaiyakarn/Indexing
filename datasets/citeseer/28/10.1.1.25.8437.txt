hyper system implements new approach knowledge compilation function free order acyclic horn theories transformed propositional logic 
compilation method integrates techniques deductive databases relevance reasoning theory transformation unfold fold transformations obtain compact propositional representation 
transformed theory compact ground version original theory terms significantly shorter clauses 
form compilation called knowledge base reformation important efficient reasoning methods defined propositional theories knowledge naturally expressed order language 
particular show knowledge reformation allows low order polynomial time inference find near optimal solution cost order hypothetical reasoning abduction problems 
representations designed variety queries contain information relevant answering particular query query type levy see literature semantic query optimization 
second interesting problems artificial intelligence require representational power order theories known reasoning theories computationally expensive levesque 
hand considerable progress developing efficient mechanisms propositional reasoning 
instance gsat efficient procedure solving propositional satisfiability problems selman kautz sl methods fast mechanisms solving propositional hypothetical abductive reasoning problems ishizuka workers 
recall hypothetical reasoning np hard basic forms propositional problems eiter gottlob :10.1.1.37.2425
aim knowledge reformation preserve generality compactness representing knowledge order horn logic time allow processing highly efficient propositional knowledge base kb 
knowledge reformation extends existing knowledge compilation cadoli donini order case 
compilation methods preprocess propositional kb line result speed line query answering 
contrast start order kb generate propositional kb manageable size 
expect efficiency gain significant unnecessary variables eliminated 
example chain theory consist clauses path link link link link link link set element hypotheses take 
varying number constants obtain theories different size 
may look theories greater smaller number links definition path varying number experiment assume call instance path example 
simplicity assume default value cost weight element hypotheses essentially looking solution hypothetical reasoning problem :10.1.1.37.2425
