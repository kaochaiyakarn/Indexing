information extraction rules extending domain ontologies position statement ijcai workshop ontology learning michael markus van andreas abecker german research center artificial intelligence dfki knowledge management group box kaiserslautern germany phone fax mail dfki de ontologies project project aim development framework distributed organizational memories oms 
start observation knowledge expertise heavily distributed organization 
accept fact intermediary imperfect state overcome central structured information system natural meaningful situation om systems normal start small focussed systems interoperate expertise better created hold maintained locally case collaborations virtual teams deeper integration information systems achieved 
main goal project develop scalable extensible om middleware built easy integration new components linking collaborating components 
builds framework contextually aware ontology oms relaxes constraints original model especially idea centralized om set organizational ontologies :10.1.1.139.2720
technical provisions distributed highly dynamic environment lay special emphasis considerations methods necessary realize scenario industrial practice 
employ pattern learning algorithm automatically construct information extraction rules specific examples creating general statements text patterns evidence certain ontological relationship 
example information extraction rule form order detect instance method possible cure disease relationship search instance concept disease look synonym word stem treat distance words search word distance words directly followed instance concept cure 
order learn information extraction rules need prerequisites sufficiently detailed representation documents particular including word positions usual conventional vector learning algorithms wordnet synsets part speech tagging 
sufficiently powerful representation formalism extraction patterns 
learning algorithm direct access background knowledge sources available seed ontology containing statements known concept instances wordnet database lexical knowledge linking words synonyms sets giving access superclasses synonym sets ilp rule learner specifically adapted task pattern text classification solved methods information extraction task ontology learning application fulfills requirements :10.1.1.51.3651
rule learner relies document representation order words preserved 
learned text patterns test order distance specific words 
shown implementation concepts mapped standard ilp approaches shows expressive power respect pattern representation extended full lp formalisms including recursive rules 
elaborate bit integration background knowledge sources especially wordnet
