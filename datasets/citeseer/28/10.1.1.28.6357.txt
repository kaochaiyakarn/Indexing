goal directed adaptive behavior second order neural networks leaning evolving maxson architecture frederick michael dyer artificial intelligence lab computer science department university california los angeles los angeles ca cs ucla edu august presents neural network architecture maxson second order connections learn multiple goal approach avoid task reinforcement environment 
shows maxson learn certain spatial navigation tasks faster traditional qlearning learn goal directed behavior increasing agent chances long term survival 
shows portions learning rules evolved genetic algorithms 
problem agents reside complex environments need able meet survival goals goals simultaneously high priority 
environment dynamic agents pre programmed meet goals learn meet 
presents maxson flexible neural architecture learns faster traditional reinforcement learning approaches generates applies reinforcement plausible manner balance requirements multiple simultaneous goals
