article assume reader familiar robocup simulator soccer server 
detailed overview soccer server including agent perception actuator capabilities :10.1.1.71.2400
remainder article organized follows 
section describes improvements cmunited low level skills including teammate opponent modeling capabilities 
section presents improvements cmunited team level coordination methods 
section focuses process low level skills improved 
optimal model described section help decision 
agent shoots true shot margin defined section gets certain threshold cycle cmunited time take goalie proceed directly ball steal gets certain threshold cycles cmunited 
skill extremely effective competition vast majority goals scored specialized code 
coordination great deal cmunited coordination mechanisms changed significantly cmunited 
refer reader information behavior modes locker room agreement roles formations strategic positioning attraction repulsion spar communication :10.1.1.34.8820
ball handling decision crucial improvement cmunited agents decision making process control ball 
decisions times crucial robotic soccer domain 
general agent options dribbling ball direction passing teammate shooting ball clearing ball simply controlling ball 
chooses affects options teammates opponents 
decisions times crucial robotic soccer domain 
general agent options dribbling ball direction passing teammate shooting ball clearing ball simply controlling ball 
chooses affects options teammates opponents 
agent uses complex heuristic decision mechanism incorporating machine learning module choose action 
significant changes cmunited agents special purpose code see section pass evaluation decision tree retrained practice games capture agents improved ball interception ability see section agents cross ball see agents consider teammate better position shoot ball see section :10.1.1.1.6598
presenting agent decision making process predicates defined section distance goal distance opponent goal distance goal distance goal opponents front goal number opponents including goalie cone shown closest opponent distance closest opponent closer goal teammate closer opponent goal agent ball shoot distance goal opponents front goal shot margin

cases passes teammates decision tree predicts able successfully receive pass called potential receivers pr 
potential receiver satisfying criteria predicted highest confidence receive pass chosen 
pr better shot pass execute special purpose code see section 
distance goal opponents front goal shot margin shoot goal 
extreme distance goal closest opponent clear ball kick opponent :10.1.1.34.8820
pr closer goal shoot congestion congestion pass cross target cross target cross behavior 
black areas agent kicks ball cross target opposite side field 
grey areas tries dribble baseline closer corner 
possible due opponent positions kicks ball cross target opposite side field 
pr opponent pass kick ball away clear 
notice ball handling strategy potentially lead players passing ball backwards away opponent goal 
observed passes times course games 
forward passes shots ball handling decision generally get executed 
line training various agent skills described section parameters affecting details skill execution :10.1.1.34.8820
example ball skill dribbling parameters affect quickly agent dashes far ahead aims ball opponents affect location ball dribbling 
settings parameters usually involve tradeoff speed versus safety power versus accuracy 
important gain understanding exactly tradeoffs correct parameter settings
