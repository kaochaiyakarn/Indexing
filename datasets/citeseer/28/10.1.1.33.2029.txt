describes application techniques characterizing animal behavior evaluation complex agents 
describe conditions lead behavioral variability requires experimental methods 
review state art psychological experimental design analysis show application complex agents 
discuss specific methodological concern agent research robots versus simulations debate interacts statistical evaluation 
specific proposal facilitating scientific method 
researchers build simulations may validity complexity agents operate 
problem solution control researcher difficult certain unconscious deliberate bias entered experiments 
contrast robot considered clear demonstrations autonomous artifact achievements problem space 
robots better simulations 
arguments led wide spread adoption autonomous robot research platform despite known problems platform :10.1.1.57.5331
problems reduce essentially fact robots extremely costly 
popularity funded research mass production reduce initial cost purchase construction relatively expensive terms researcher technician time programming maintenance experimental procedures 
prevented researchers conducting rigorous experimental robot platforms see 
difficulty procedures adds urgency question validity experiments simulation 
experimental results provided simulations replicated precisely laboratories 
consequently generally easily tested confirmed collected robots 
extent simulation created possibly community single effort resulting platform unlimited numbers experiments laboratories world wide simulation hope overcoming argument gross increase complexity simulations particularly true platforms 
simulator developed simulation league robocup soccer competition proven enormously successful 
competition takes place robots date simulator league provides far realistic soccer games terms allowing demonstration teamwork players flexible offensive defensive strategies :10.1.1.47.9163
success encouraged robocup organization tackle complex simulator designed replicate catastrophic disasters urban settings 
simulator intended sufficiently realistic eventually allow swapping real time sensory data disaster situations order allow disaster relief monitor coordinate human robotic rescue efforts 
second platform independently motivated provide full complexity real world 
commercial arena virtual reality vr provides simulated environment practical demanding constraints easily overlooked
