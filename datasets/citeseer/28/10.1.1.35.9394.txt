text collections may regarded perfect application arena unsupervised neural networks 
operations computers perform text documents classification tasks noisy patterns 
particular rely self organizing maps produce map document space training process 
geography known maps best way represent information spaces 
applications better provide hierarchical view underlying data collection form atlas starting map representing complete data collection different regions shown finer levels granularity
