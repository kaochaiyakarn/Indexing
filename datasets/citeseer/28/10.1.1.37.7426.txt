unfortunately delay incurred message delivered difficult implement high performance scalable applications top atomic broadcast primitives 
new approach proposed optimistic assumptions communication system reduces average delay message delivery 
develop idea replicated database architecture employs new atomic broadcast primitive way coordination phase atomic broadcast fully overlapped execution transactions providing high performance relaxing transaction correctness 

motivation atomic broadcast primitives known mechanism increase fault tolerance provide semantically rich framework develop distributed systems :10.1.1.125.8216
