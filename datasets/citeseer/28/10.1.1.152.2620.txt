url filtering 
determine url homepage note homepage url contains version person name 
apply string kernel distance measure various forms person name field url accept homepages exceed threshold :10.1.1.130.2853
name forms include full name email login name available 

homepage retrieval 
page passes filtering crawl internal hyperlink structure retrieve user entire web home directory 
results larger representation person web presence frequently provides pages contact information people names located 
prevent overflow limit total number retrieved pages person reasonably small constant 

filtering irrelevant homepages

clustering edges extracted social network currently attributes weights base clustering algorithm 
algorithm relies notion betweenness centrality 
shortest paths vertices betweenness edge number shortest paths traverse 
idea edges high betweenness connect people distinct communities edges low betweenness connect people community 
efficiently calculate betweenness edge rely variant pairs shortest path augmented keep usage counts edges :10.1.1.11.2024
proceeds looping vertex vi performing dijkstra shortest path algorithm calculate shortest vi vertices 
betweenness count edge shortest paths vi calculated added running total 
vi considered betweenness edge exactly half running total considered pair endpoints twice 
cluster graph repeatedly remove edge highest betweenness certain stopping criteria met 
removing edge recalculate betweenness edges connected component edge chosen removal edge high betweenness greatly affects resulting set shortest paths
