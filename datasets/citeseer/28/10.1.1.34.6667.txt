important need multi robot systems development mechanisms enable robot teams autonomously generate cooperative behaviors 
rst brie presents cooperative multi robot observation multiple moving targets cmommt application rich domain studying issues multi robot learning new behaviors 
discuss results algorithm cmommt describe research generating multi robot learning techniques cmommt application comparing results hand generated solutions 
results show learning approach performs better random naive approaches room remains match results obtained hand generated approach 
ultimate goal research develop techniques multi robot learning adaptation generalize cooperative robot applications domains facilitating practical multi robot teams wide variety real world applications
