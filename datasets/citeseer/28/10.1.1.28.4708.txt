historically considered challenging task requiring temporal planner ability reason explicitly time 
show simple modifications strips action representation language represent interacting actions 
algorithms partial order planning require small modifications order applied multiagent domains 
demonstrate fact developing sound complete partial order planner planning concurrent interacting actions pomp extends existing partial order planners straightforward way 
results open way partial order planners centralized control cooperative multiagent systems 

order construct plans agents multiple actuators multi armed robots agent teams controllers distributed environment able model effects interactions multiple actions executed concurrently generate plans take interactions account 
viable solution basic multiagent multi actuator planning map problem include economical action descriptions convenient specify easily manipulable planning algorithms planning methods deal interactions generally associated concurrent actions 
surprisingly despite interest multiagent applications instance robotics donald jennings rus khatib chang baader distributed ai see various proceedings international conference multiagent systems large body distributed multiagent planning little research addresses basic problem planning context concurrent interacting actions
