separate conquer rule learning johannes furnkranz ai ac austrian research institute artificial intelligence wien austria technical report tr survey inductive rule learning algorithms separate strategy 
strategy traced back aq learning system enjoys popularity seen frequent inductive logic programming systems 
put wide variety algorithms single framework analyze different dimensions search language overfitting avoidance biases 

give overview large family symbolic rule learning algorithms called separate conquer covering algorithms 
members family share top level loop basically separate conquer algorithm searches rule explains part training instances separates examples recursively remaining examples learning rules examples remain
