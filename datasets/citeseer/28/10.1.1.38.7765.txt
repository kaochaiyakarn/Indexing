issue ill posedness lack context 
context provider inductive bias reason choose candidate concept 
classical algorithm concept learning choose candidate concept favored bias 
methodology analogous bayesian inference likelihood function serves isolate candidates prior provides bias :10.1.1.27.9072
important axes biases vary strength precision accuracy correctness 
strong biases focus learner relatively small number concepts 
assigning equal probability candidate concepts weakest possible bias 
weakness bias analogous entropy prior probability distribution 
proper bias selection needed performance measured terms accuracy concepts number examples required achieve concept learning efficiency 
algorithms concept grammar bias occam razor 
attempt choose candidate concept shortest representation particular grammar 
choice grammar guided belief teacher grammar mind grammar serves convenient means expressing preference ordering large set concepts 
methodology analogous expressing bayesian inference terms minimum description length inventing suitable notion description :10.1.1.27.9072
concept vocabulary available algorithms groupings derived hierarchical clustering chapter 
suitable vocabulary described grammars sufficient encode concepts 
number candidate concepts set examples grammars 
traditional analysis methods unable distinguish grammars vc dimension infinite accurate
