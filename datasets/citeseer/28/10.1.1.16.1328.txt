aliasing world wide web prevalence performance implications kelly electrical engineering computer science university michigan ann arbor mi usa eecs umich edu aliasing occurs web transactions requests containing different urls elicit replies containing identical data payloads 
aliasing cause cache misses reason suspect shelf web authoring tools increase aliasing web 
existing research literature says little prevalence aliasing user initiated transactions impact performance large multi level cache hierarchies 
quantifies performance impact extent aliasing large client trace webtv networks 
fewer reply payloads aliased referenced multiple urls successful transactions involve aliased payloads 
aliased payloads account trace working set size sum payload sizes bytes transferred 
section review literature relationship urls reply payloads 
resource modification resource modification complement aliasing requests containing identical urls yield different reply bodies 
direct implications cache consistency object resource modification extensively studied 
section compare prevalence aliasing resource modification report transactions affected 
douglis report rates resource modification trace corporate environment high substantially reduce hit rates conventional url indexed caches :10.1.1.30.2529
cybenko consider burden modification rates place search engines 
fitting combination exponential models data report roughly inter modification intervals days roughly days 
doctoral thesis considers problem monitoring changing information resources greater theoretical empirical depth 
research polling urls obtained users requested notification specified resources change reflect sample resources atypical rates change 
bharat broder investigate mirroring large crawler data set report roughly popular hosts mirrored extent 
broder consider approximate mirroring syntactic similarity 
introduce sophisticated measures document similarity report clusters similar documents large crawler data set contain identical documents 
words simple aliasing dominant form similarity workload 
duplicate suppression douglis report full body responses recorded corporate firewall resulted new instance particular resource identical instance different resource :10.1.1.30.2529
duplicate suppression proposals address performance problems caused duplication 
distribution replication protocol employs payload digests avoid unnecessary data transmission deliberate replication 
client obtains index files containing digests indicating current state resources client request precisely resources copies obsolete 
mogul reviewed variety duplicate suppression schemes involving hints supplied origin servers clients clients caches 
logs caching proxy suffer problem logs necessarily reflect payloads origin servers provide proxies serve stale content payloads origin server cache hit 
trace collected proxy normally fails capture user requests hit client browser caches 
problems conventional proxy logs include inadequate detail low resolution timestamps poor clock synchronization multiple host proxy arrays 
principle avoid problems collecting traces instrumented client capture user 
instrumented browsers collect traces small user populations :10.1.1.2.1361
difficult instrument popular browsers today source code unavailable client proxy collect data 
main problem client data collection difficulty deployment large client sample 
collecting traces analyze webtv employed non caching cache proxy 
cache proxy marks replies sends clients effectively disabling browser caches 
webtv sizes similar slightly smaller berkeley sizes consistent slow final hops environments

prevalence aliasing exceeds resource modification 
note imply aliasing causes cache misses resource modification fact reverse true 
simulations address question 
douglis compute url change ratio fraction accesses return different data payload previous access :10.1.1.30.2529
furthermore compute multiply referenced payload analogous metric alias ratio defined fraction accesses different url previous access 
distributions change ratios alias ratios multiply referenced urls payloads respectively shown 
shows multiply referenced payloads aliased multiply referenced urls modified 
shows alias ratios generally lower change ratios
