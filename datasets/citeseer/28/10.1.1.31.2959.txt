flexible metric nearest neighbor classication jerome friedman november nearest neighbor decision rule assigns object unknown class plurality class labeled training objects closest 
closeness usually dened terms metric distance euclidean space input measurement variables axes 
metric chosen dene distance strongly performance 
optimal choice depends problem hand characterized respective class distributions input measurement space problem location unknown object space 
new types nearest neighbor procedures described estimate local relevance input variable linear combinations individual point 
information separately customize metric dene distance object nding nearest neighbors
