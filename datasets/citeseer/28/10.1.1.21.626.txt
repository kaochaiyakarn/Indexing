advent multiagent systems brought disciplines effort build distributed intelligent robust applications 
new way look distributed systems provided path robust intelligent applications 
traditional ways thinking designing software fit multiagent paradigm 
past years attempts creating tools methodologies building systems 
unfortunately tools focused specific agent architectures gone necessary level detail adequately support complex system development :10.1.1.53.3254:10.1.1.27.9180
research developing methodology complimentary environment analyzing designing developing heterogeneous multiagent systems 
methodology developing multiagent systems engineering mase 
constructing multiagent systems difficult 
problems traditional distributed concurrent systems plus additional difficulties arise flexibility requirements sophisticated interactions 
related proposed methodologies analyzing designing building multiagent systems 
majority existing objectoriented knowledge methodologies 
fact syntax models taken unified modeling language methodology dissimilar object oriented approaches 
mase builds agent approaches takes ideas combines complete methodology 
instance goals roles kendall influenced initial mase analysis steps mapping roles agent classes builds concepts kinny georgeff rao :10.1.1.27.9180
gaia approach attempts encompass entire life cycle authors admit shortcomings 
main advantage mase previous methodologies scope completeness 

multiagent systems engineering methodology multiagent system engineering mase methodology takes initial system specification produces set formal design documents graphically style
