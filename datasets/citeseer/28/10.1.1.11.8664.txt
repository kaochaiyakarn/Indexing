nec research institute developing experimental metasearch engine called inquirus lawrence giles :10.1.1.33.3985:10.1.1.43.7836
inquirus motivated problems current metasearch engines poor precision limited coverage limited availability limited user interfaces date databases major web search engines 
list documents summaries returned search engines current metasearch engines typically inquirus works downloading analyzing individual documents 
inquirus improvements existing engines number areas useful document summaries incorporating query term context identification pages longer exist pages longer contain query terms improved detection duplicate pages progressive display results improved document ranking proximity information inquirus full text pages avoids ranking problem standard metasearch engines dramatically improved precision certain queries specific expressive forms quick jump links highlighting viewing full documents 
fundamental features inquirus analyzes document displays local context query terms

relative increase size indexable web brin page resulting favorable scaling properties centralized text search engines :10.1.1.109.4049
increased number specialized search services may arise cover specific types information 
expensive better algorithms google produce improved page rankings 
information retrieval techniques aimed large diverse low signal noise ratio database web developed 
interesting possibility machine learning order create query transformations similar specific expressive forms technique discussed earlier
