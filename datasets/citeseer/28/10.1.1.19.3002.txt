proposed approach able extract dbg patterns form potential communities including cbg patterns 
show effectiveness proposed approach report experimental results conducted gb trec text retrieval conference data collection contains pages links

addition proposed approach easily parallelized 
rest organized follows 
section define proposed community bipartite graph abstraction discuss motivation 
consider possibility community formation 
proposed approach complementary hits trawling algorithms 
large page collection trawling algorithm may extract communities extracting 
main advantage proposed approach see experiment results extracts significantly big graph patterns compared corresponding cbg patterns 
find cbg patterns trawling approach trawling algorithm employs priori algorithm :10.1.1.40.6757
follow different approach community detection 
page extract related pages relationship 
perform iterative pruning technique extract dbg structure 
complexity proposed approach linear amount computation time find communities increases linearly number pages page collection 
flow approach set crawled pages topic problem detecting community abstracted maximum flow minimum cut framework source composed known members sink consist known non members 
set pages topic community defined set web pages link direction pages community pages outside community 
flow approach guide crawling related pages 
try extract community structures collection 
approaches data mining approach focuses largely finding association rules statistical correlation measures data set :10.1.1.40.6757
notion finding communities differs fact approach relationship exploit citation data mining performed support confidence 
earlier uses link structure analysis social networks network properties cliques centroids diameters analyze collective properties interacting agents 
fields citation analysis bibliometrics citation links works literature identify patterns collections 
search engines perform link text analysis increase quality search results 
noted current memory technology allows allows keep reasonably large link file main memory 
observed proposed algorithm easily parallelized 
copying link file different nodes load distributed equally nodes reducing processing time factor equal number parallel nodes 
relatively finding cbg patterns complicated process 
trawling approach dbgs various sizes calculated mainly employing priori algorithm :10.1.1.40.6757
compared cbg approach proposed better suits find potential communities having features linear complexity parallelism 
extract emerging communities run proposed approach data collection 
extracting potential communities emerging communities excluding communities exist yahoo search engine portals 
shown proposed approach find significantly big community patterns data collection 
dbg abstraction enables detection potential communities page collection capturing micro level relationships 
part investigate issue grouping similar communities
