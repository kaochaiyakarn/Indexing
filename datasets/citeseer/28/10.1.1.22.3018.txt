design implementation bitmap indices scientific data kurt cern european organization nuclear research geneva switzerland institute computer science business informatics university vienna austria kurt cern ch bitmap indices efficient multi dimensional index data structures handling complex adhoc queries environments 
implemented commercial database systems suited discrete attribute values common typical business applications 
scientific applications usually operate floating point numbers take advantage optimisation techniques offered current database solutions 
novel algorithm called processing sided range queries floating point values 
addition cost model predicting performance bitmap indices high dimensional search spaces 
verify analytical results detailed experimental study show bitmap evaluation algorithm scales high dimensional search spaces requiring fairly small index
