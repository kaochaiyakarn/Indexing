efficiently querying moving objects pre defined paths distributed environment shahabi jose luis ambite craig knoblock department computer science information sciences institute university southern california los angeles california shahabi usc edu ambite knoblock isi edu due growth world wide web numerous spatio temporal applications obtain required information publicly available web sources 
consider sources maintaining moving objects predefined paths schedules investigate different plans perform queries integration data sources efficiently 
examples data sources networks railroad paths schedules trains running cities connected networks 
typical query data sources find trains pass point network time interval 
show traditional filter semi join plans result efficient query response times distributed spatio temporal sources 
propose novel spatio temporal filter called deviation filter exploits spatial temporal characteristics sources order improve selectivity
