transaction reordering replicated databases fernando pedone guerraoui andre schiper informatique ecole polytechnique de lausanne lausanne switzerland presents fault tolerant lazy replication protocol ensures copy serializability relatively low cost 
eager replication approaches protocol enables local transaction execution lead deadlock situation 
compared previous lazy replication approaches significantly reduce abort rate transactions require reconciliation procedure 
protocol executes transactions locally broadcasts transaction certification message replica managers employs certification procedure ensure copy serializability 
certification messages broadcast non blocking atomic broadcast primitive alleviates need expensive non blocking atomic commitment algorithm 
certification procedure uses reordering technique reduce probability transaction aborts

replication long considered intuitive way increase availability designing efficient distributed protocol provides fault tolerance ensures replica consistency difficult issue 
context databases gray distinguish classes replication protocols eager lazy eager protocols considered expensive require remote communication transaction execution data access synchronized replica managers :10.1.1.116.1182
lazy protocols enable local transaction processing require remote communication transaction execution committing transactions certified 
supported industrial university rio brazil distinction primary backup master state machine protocols leads orthogonal classification 
certification procedure checks replica managers transactions violate data consistency case aborted committed transactions 
major drawback lazy protocols high rate aborts reconciliation procedures 
commit time transaction certification message sent available servers atomic broadcast primitive 
transaction committed serialized transactions committed 
certification test similar classical kung robinson approach leads abort rate significantly higher protocol see section 

gray propose lazy replication protocol mobile computing :10.1.1.116.1182
kinds servers considered mobile servers base servers 
mobile servers store old versions database issue tentative transactions connected base servers may committed aborted depending conflicts generated 
base servers master fashion 
data items masters base servers servers assumed connected
