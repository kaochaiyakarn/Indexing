real time error location modeling ubiquitous computing jeffrey university washington computer science engineering box seattle wa cs washington edu october matter technologies techniques ubiquitous location system uses measurements amount error 
unfortunately error information conveyed arbitrarily simply performance evaluation online characteristic system behavior 
terms accuracy precision granularity resolution overloaded various meanings 
short argue real time error distributions provide concise quantitative summarization system accuracy useful applications simulation sensor fusion 
previously advocated ubiquitous location sensing community error distribution summarize location system accuracy precision
