case geographical push caching james seltzer harvard university das harvard edu existing wide area caching schemes client initiated 
decisions cache information benefit server global knowledge situation 
believe server play role making caching decisions propose geographical push caching way bringing server back loop 
world wide web excellent example wide area system benefit geographical push caching architecture allows web server autonomously replicate html pages 
world wide web operates part cache distributed system 
neighboring clients retrieve document server document sent twice 
likewise new server load high replicate file cached place access patterns new server different old server 
issues addressed scheme file consistency resource discovery 
server may determine copy file date get modified request 
efficient way check consistency request new file event modified expensive time file requested 
weak consistency acceptable web scheme developed alex file system :10.1.1.159.7390
exception dynamic pages addressed separately expect web obey principle ftp older file modified 
older file server caching frequently server poll check copy 
efficient compared checking request client able force poll essential latest file 
resource location groups file replication taken place file replicated west coast server minimize network bandwidth 
archie written machine independent network service scripting language tcl code replicated cached just web file 
answer cache dynamic pages generated cgi bin scripts create web pages fly
