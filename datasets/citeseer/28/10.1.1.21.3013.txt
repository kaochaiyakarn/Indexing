evolve intelligent web crawlers menczer department management sciences university iowa iowa city ia menczer edu dynamic nature world wide web challenge find information relevant 
intelligent agents complement power search engines meet challenge 
web tool called implements evolutionary algorithms managing population adaptive crawlers browse web autonomously 
agent acts intelligent client behalf user driven user query textual linkage clues crawled pages 
agents autonomously decide links follow clues spawn offspring focus search near relevant source 
tool available public threaded java applet 
crawled pages stored static index mapping term controlled vocabulary collection urls containing term 
index query time return sets urls containing terms users queries 
due dynamic nature web set relevant pages query highly dynamic leading scalability problem assumption accurate complete static image web breaks rate change 
search engines fail satisfy user need complete updated information highly desirable improve coverage recency search engines 
approach address coverage issue meta search techniques combine relevant sets multiple search engines :10.1.1.43.7836:10.1.1.54.5195:10.1.1.28.1932
meta search engines locate pages unknown individual engines results combined 
number intelligent agents developed years help users manage information available web 
agents generally limited autonomy rely completely search engines told go user follow fixed heuristics 
systems fish search crawl query time hindered lack adaptability agents identical clones fixed search strategies 
systems fish search crawl query time hindered lack adaptability agents identical clones fixed search strategies 
suggest radical solution scalability problem complementing index search engines intelligent search agents user 
describes evolutionary multi agent system designed browse adaptively behalf user complement search engines 
discuss implementation agents java 
infospiders algorithm infospiders multi agent system online dynamic web search :10.1.1.43.7796
agent checks information neighborhood defined hyperlinks looking new documents relevant user query having little interaction agents 
infospiders able display intelligent behavior evaluating relevance document content respect user query reasoning autonomously actions mimic browsing habits human users 
adaptation occurs individual population levels evolutionary reinforcement learning 
goal maintain diversity global level trying achieve coverage aspects related query capturing relevant features agent local information environment 
isolation front agents managed middle manager tier 
manager provides api allows front start search provide user modifiable parameters query search status 
manager knows initiate monitor threaded search agents 
current design easy plug new search mechanism minimal code change 
example latest implementation allows user change crawling algorithm infospiders best crawler proved valid alternative certain circumstances :10.1.1.1.9569:10.1.1.43.7796
best selects links priority queue keeps outlinks visited pages sorted similarity pages query 
user interface crawl 
early search process top hits google 
search process spider reproduced visible expandable tree 
modular software design easy reconfigure system various experiments 
java code portable nature lack adequate support applets popular browsers adds extra effort deployment 
addition applet implementation web browsing agents suffers portability limitations due security issues 
infospiders evaluated favorably controlled corpus evidence web 
continue evaluate utility technique compared state ofthe art crawling methods :10.1.1.1.9569
