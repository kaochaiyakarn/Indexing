advantages method proofs reusability parts proofs relation reuse components 
method illustrated example multi agent system consisting cooperative information gathering agents 
application verification method results formal analysis pro activeness reactiveness agents shows combinations pro activeness reactiveness specific type information agents lead successful cooperation 
designing multi agent systems hard guarantee specification system designed needs satisfies design requirements 
especially critical applications example real time domains need prove designed system certain properties certain conditions assumptions
