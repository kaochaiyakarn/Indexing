discussion lp main features contribute excellence experiments single tag rules correction phase rule generalisation shallow nlp processing 
points discussed ciravegna :10.1.1.33.1770
focus effect nlp generalisation 
lp induces rules instance generalisation shallow nlp processing 
generalisation examples training corpus allows reducing data sparseness capturing general aspects simple flat word structure 
morphology allows overcoming data sparseness due number gender word aspect relevant morphologically rich slot lp lp ng speaker location stime etime slots lp lp ng average rule coverage selected rules rules covering case rules covering cases rules covering cases comparison nlp generalisation version lp corpora www isi edu muslea rise index html 
particular lp definitely outperforms algorithms making nlp information rapier whisk terms accuracy respectively cmu experiment 
mainly due tagging correction learning algorithm algorithms able exploit nlp information 
rapier uses tagging approach equivalent best tagging step lp able induce expressive rules making powerful wild cards uses randomly compression rule mechanism generalisation tends produce rules providing spurious results ciravegna 
whisk able sophisticated nlp information able output parser 
unfortunately uses multi slot rules increase data sparseness training phase leading low recall ciravegna :10.1.1.33.1770
concerning non nlp algorithms tagging approach generally equivalent best rule tagging phase lp tend sophisticated machine learning approaches 
bwi example learns single tag rules largely equivalent best rules lp boosting schapire emphasize examples learner doing poorly order derive additional rules 
rule formalism includes number wildcards contribute radically algorithm experimental results effectiveness 
bwi type nlp preprocessing 
lp slightly outperforms bwi experiments 
opinion due combined effect contextual tagging phase correction phase nlp generalization believe relevant
