agent technologies applied development large scale commercial industrial software systems 
systems complex involving hundreds thousands agents pressing need system modelling techniques permit complexity effectively managed principled methodologies guide process system design 
adequate techniques support design process systems sufficiently reliable maintainable extensible difficult comprehend elements re usable 
accordance considerations mentioned concrete agents result may reflect groupings services responsibilities differ original roles 
identification agent boundaries deferred information procedures perform services elaborated 
results concrete agents internal structure inherently modular 
simple service relationships interactions agents represented associations agent model chosen describe separate model 
modelling agent interactions currently subject intensive research modelling techniques quite complex proposed developed see example :10.1.1.56.7580:10.1.1.35.9555
address issues information content linguistic intent protocols coordination negotiation 
hold strong view general suitability particular techniques modelling interactions methodology modelling framework designed allow selection models appropriate application domain 
interaction model captures control relationships agents responsibilities agent creation deletion delegation team formation 
modelling techniques relationships subject ongoing research
