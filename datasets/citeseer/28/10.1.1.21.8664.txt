complex systems easily described controlled seen multi agent systems mas constellation satellites multi robots applications 
design mas usually built hand need repeated simulations tune system 
propose build system having agent locally learn behavior 
reinforcement learning rl context mas su ers limitations learning task nearly impossible combinatorial explosion 
burden rl algorithms grows exponentially number states actions system
