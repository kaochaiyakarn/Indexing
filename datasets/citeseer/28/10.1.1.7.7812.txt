years witnessed birth new paradigm learning environments animated pedagogical agents 
lifelike autonomous characters learning environments students create rich face face learning interactions 
opens exciting new possibilities example agents demonstrate complex tasks employ locomotion gesture focus students attention salient aspect task hand convey emotional responses tutorial situation 
animated pedagogical agents offer great promise broadening bandwidth tutorial communication increasing learning environments ability engage motivate students 
article sets forth motivations animated pedagogical agents describes key capabilities offer discusses technical issues raise 
locomotion gaze gestures focus student attention lester badler rickel johnson 
gaze regulate turn dialogue cassell 
head nods facial expressions provide johnson rickel lester unobtrusive feedback student utterances actions unnecessarily disrupting student train thought

mere presence lifelike agent may increase student arousal motivation perform task lester walker sproull :10.1.1.91.8779
animated pedagogical agents key advantages earlier increase bandwidth communication students computers increase computer ability engage motivate students 
animated pedagogical agents share aspects common synthetic agents developed entertainment applications elliott need give user impression lifelike believable producing behavior appears user natural appropriate 
important reasons making pedagogical agents lifelike believable 
lifelike agents engaging making learning experience enjoyable 
agent appears care student progress may encourage student care progress 
second emotive pedagogical agent may convey enthusiasm subject animated pedagogical agents face face interaction interactive learning environments matter foster similar levels enthusiasm learner 
pedagogical agent rich interesting personality may simply learning fun 
learner enjoys interacting pedagogical agent may positive perception learning experience may consequently opt spend time learning environment 
result inherent nature student agent interactions humans tendency software reeves nass evidence suggests tutoring systems lifelike characters effective lester time having strong motivating effect students lester :10.1.1.91.8779
apparent particular features personal characteristics lifelike agents important impact learners acceptance 
master animators discovered repeatedly past century quality clarity dramatic impact communication increased creation emotive movement underscores affective content message communicated jones thomas johnston 
carefully facial expression body placement arm movements hand gestures animated pedagogical agents visually augment verbal problem solving advice give encouragement convey empathy increase motivation 
example cosmo agent employs repertoire full body emotive behaviors advise encourage appear students 
discussed section nearly major facet communicative abilities needs considerable research 
reason early development conduct comprehensive definitive empirical studies demonstrate effectiveness learning environments 
communicative abilities limited compared expect near results studies skewed technology 
despite caveat essential initial assessing impact learning studies undertaken objective mind

researchers wanted obtain baseline reading potential effectiveness animated pedagogical agents examine impact various forms agents advice 
conducted study middle school students student interacted versions herman agent 
different versions varied dimensions 
complete descriptions experimental methods analyses contained cited papers 
finding indicates may important learning benefits introducing animated agents employ visual animated auditory verbal modalities give practical theoretical advice 
complexity benefits benefits animated pedagogical agents increase problem solving complexity 
students faced complex problems positive effects animated pedagogical agents problem solving pronounced 
finding suggests agents may particularly effective helping students solve complex technical problems opposed simple toy problems
