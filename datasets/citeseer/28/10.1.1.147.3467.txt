citeseer uses efficient approach location articles publicly indexable web 
specifically citeseer uses web search engines altavista directly locate pages contain research articles 
multiple queries search engines various keywords match pages containing scientific articles postscript pdf technical report conference proceedings 
multiple search engines substantially improves coverage web 
method number advantages 
method avoids duplication involved crawling web allows combination search engines substantially improves coverage single crawler currently available 
method allows easy customization database specific areas literature including appropriate keywords queries

full text indexing performed citeseer similar standard techniques important differences 
citeseer aims date possible 
indexing designed continuous operation updates performed continuously building merging new index 
index organization similar previous 
citeseer maintains usual hash table words inverted index entry contains compressed version word pointer block variable length record file contains matching documents corresponding positions documents compressed single bit stream variable length identifiers 
entries word grow space allocated grows power 
citeseer supports full boolean phrase proximity retrieval standard recursive descent parser 
citeseer words common words typically excluded indexing 
important allowing higher precision search 
example important searching specific author 
author names specified citations initials full name 
looking information author common name important able restrict results items contain correct name author initials 
necessary able search phrases containing initials 
test database documents citations queries typically executed fraction second pentium pro machine 
performance degrades second longer queries include phrases contain common words 
demonstration database queries author initials example jordan jordan common accounting queries 
queries seconds due frequent occurrence initials citations 
order speed queries cache list word positions maintain hash table initial indexed document identifier entry contains list positions document 
proximity comparisons including initials typically need examine entire document list anymore 
randomly selected queries initials order quantify speedup 
table shows results 
speedup queries initials times slower queries average 
speedup queries initials executed faster queries 
autonomous citation indexing citeseer includes autonomous citation indexing autonomous creation citation index similar science table query execution time random queries initials test database documents containing citations

autonomous citation indexing provides advantages traditional citation indexing 
traditional citation indexing requires manual effort 
automating task performed citeseer result reduction cost increase availability citation indices 
autonomous citation index provide comprehensive date indices literature science citation index primarily indexes journal articles citeseer index conference papers preprints technical reports importance indexing non journal items varies discipline particularly important areas computer science important research conferences
