describe formalism compare algorithms solving distributed con straint satisfaction problems 
particular newly developed technique called asynchronous backtracking allows agents act asynchronously concurrently contrast traditional sequential backtracking techniques employed constraint satisfaction problems 
experimental results show solving distributed fashion worthwhile problems solved individual agents loosely coupled 
cooperative distributed problem solving cdps subfield ai concerned set artificially intelligent agents solve problems
