technical report database replication epidemic update agrawal el abbadi department computer science university california santa barbara santa barbara ca usa agrawal cs ucsb edu due severe performance penalties associated synchronous replication increasing interest asynchronous replica management protocols database transactions executed locally effects transactions incorporated asynchronously remote database copies 
asynchronous protocols currently guarantee consistency serializability needed transactional semantics impose restrictions placement data data objects updated 
investigate epidemic update protocol guarantees consistency serializability spite write capability 
conducted experiments detailed simulation distributed replicated database evaluate protocol 
results establish epidemic approach viable alternative traditional eager update protocols distributed database environment consistency full serializability needed 
data replication distributed databases important problem investigated extensively decade
