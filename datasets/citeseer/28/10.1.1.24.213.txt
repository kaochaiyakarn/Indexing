proposes coordination model static mobile agents structures called communicators entities handle agent dialogue performed acl speech act exchanging 
structures designed need model agent dialogue human style offering set coordination primitives general validity able provide direct indirect interaction model 
communicator handles messages exchanged defined multi agent application fully programmable possible specify messages exchanged message handled 
detail communicator performs syntactic semantic routing allowing exchange forwarding message programmed coordination laws 
proposal presents advantages authors opinion provide complete framework able meet requirements generic multi agent application 
agents software entities exhibiting sort human behaviour agent needs handle speech acts majority cases forward speech act directly agent 
cases agents need share information proper speech act adopting indirect interaction model able handle knowledge spreading 
order provide coordination infrastructure agent interaction complete possible combine single coordination framework direct indirect interaction aim offer human model agent interaction speech act exchange 
forget agent dialogue occurs context defined multi agent application defined set interaction protocols designed application engineering :10.1.1.10.2242
protocols establish rules agent dialogue derive coordination laws infrastructure handles agent interaction application 
aim proposes coordination model static mobile agents structures called communicators represent entities handle agent dialogue performed acl speech act exchange 
communicator fully programmable possible specify messages exchanged messages handled 
message exchanged passes communicator performs syntactic semantic routing allowing exchange forwarding message programmed coordination laws 
communicators composed permit flexible specification coarse fine grained 
model agent interaction designing coordination framework general validity analyze main characteristics agent interaction provide model 
rest term agent interaction refer exchange single message agents

agent interaction agents participating multi agent application take place role interaction models application allow 
specifically say multi agent application defines set interaction protocols say protocol defines set allowed interactions say formalize def 
virtual receivers control sender agent human character specify message send agents speaking scope interaction determined application context interaction occurs 
reason modelled interactions specifying association message relevant virtual receivers 
association depends requirements semantics interaction context application 
order allow flexible specification associations group interactions behaviour interaction classes generalizing field 
generalized said agent names message content names roles interaction model content generalized message template :10.1.1.10.2242
result interaction class represented tuple roles sender agent roles real receivers roles virtual receivers performative names exchanged allowed ontologies allowed content languages predicate content field regular expression representing message template 
assert message modeled belongs class fields message match relevant fields defining interaction function returns role agent predicate returns true role agent defined set predicate true role agent set defined set combining interaction class definition concepts expressed def 
relation model interaction protocol set interactions defined behaviour agent roles interaction classes say 
relation virtual receiver set refers explicitly message delivery simple message exchange occurrence
