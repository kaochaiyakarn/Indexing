frs provide excellent representation organizational structure large complex domains applicability limited inability deal uncertainty noise 
bns provide intuitive coherent probabilistic representation uncertainty limited ability handle complex structured domains 
provide language cleanly integrates approaches preserving advantages 
approach allows provide natural compact definitions probability models class way local class frame 
models instantiated set interconnected instances resulting coherent probability distribution instance properties 
models instantiated set interconnected instances resulting coherent probability distribution instance properties 
language allows represent important types uncertainty framework traditional bns uncertainty set entities model uncertainty relationships entities 
provide inference algorithm language reduction inference standard bayesian networks 
describe implemented system allows main frame systems existence today annotate knowledge bases probabilistic information information answering probabilistic queries 
frame representation systems frs currently primary technology large scale knowledge representation ai :10.1.1.37.7547
modular organization cognitively meaningful entities ability capture patterns common individuals provide convenient language representing complex structured domain models 
significant gaps expressive power type framework inability represent reason uncertain noisy information 
uncertainty unavoidable real world information inaccurate incomplete rules reasoning true possible cases
