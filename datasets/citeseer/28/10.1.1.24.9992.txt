understand role agents distributed simulation note simulations operate static datasets data sources 
simulations produce results access dynamically changing data sources sensors simulations 
perspective simulation simulations data resources producing information possibly relevant past system modeled 
model useful determining various factors ect system 
example happens closes chicago hare airport 
passengers discovered years ago storm chicago cause cancellation delay country 
nas model useful requires signi cant amounts external information 
existing sim model airline guide provides information concerning scheduled commercial sudden schedule changes rarely included model information manually inserted simulation :10.1.1.125.3310
simulation run today may information date 
similarly weather ects inserted manually large scale weather events chicago simulated 
nas simulation accurately include weather ects communicate weather simulation running concurrently 
modeling spread forest res real time area technology applied 

adaptability disconnected operations mobile agents persistent space time 
migrate network docking remote nodes network conditions unstable
