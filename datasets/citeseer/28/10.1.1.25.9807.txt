question arises transition theory practice extent basis providing methodology agent systems 
question addressed section 
methodology system development described theoretical practical agent oriented systems tended separate distinct cases completely unrelated 
aim attempt bridge divide doing move principled methodology development agent systems consequently provide footing practical aspects field 
kinny argue clear conceptual framework enables complexity system managed decomposition abstraction vital methodology :10.1.1.27.9180
starting point formal framework plays exactly role standard properties specification language satisfy requirements 
particular construct model computational system refining definitions provided framework include relevant systems constraints 
ase description earlier sampling schemas sketches achieved 
addition methodology established possible formalise methodology done high performance systems
