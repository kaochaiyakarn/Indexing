learned classification knowledge collaborative phase search engine proposed dispatches queries distributed web sites match documents presents hierarchically results internet users conventional ranked flat results 

statistics average query length words 
diverse contexts internet static thesaurus cover mismatching shifting semantics terms 
internet ir systems able search relevant documents efficiently rank organize documents accordance user expectation 
coverage internet search engines reality single search engine called server handle large number queries powerful server group servers 
furthermore empirical results show single search engine return relevant result suggesting simultaneous query independent servers may return satisfactory result :10.1.1.21.478
autonomy web sites line border organization demands mechanism collaborate web servers 
solve problems researchers advocated deployment special search engines geographic locations distribute load construct integrated gateway databases 
meta search engines meta search metacrawler reduce burden user available search engines may unknown users 
search engines handle simultaneous submission queries direct query appropriate engines post process results single interface
