motivation motivation agent framework began creation multi agent survivability simulator mass :10.1.1.51.8006
mass flexible execution environment designed simulate possible faulty hostile conditions agent function 
accurately simulating conditions create test effective algorithms deal adverse situations result multi agent systems robust 
simulator consists centralized controller object number possibly remote agents connect 
controller responsible simulating providing aspects environment agent interact 
true new component named phrase substring match execute fact original execute component exist framework cause race condition registration process
