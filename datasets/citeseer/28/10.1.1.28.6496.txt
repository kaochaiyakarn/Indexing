multiple goal learning issues functions frederick naval academy computer science dept holloway road maryland usa edu addresses concerns agents reinforcement learning learn achieve multiple simultaneous goals 
proves algorithm acting maximal goal time cases produce maximal expected utility agent 
examines type function approximator necessary agent reinforcement learning system concludes bi linear function best compromise expressive power speed learning 
mobile robot similar agent able perform tasks fully autonomously able manage multiple goals 
example agent constructing wall agent able achieve multiple subgoals building wall 
addition simultaneously meet goals necessary successful task completion maintaining adequate building supplies maintaining energy
