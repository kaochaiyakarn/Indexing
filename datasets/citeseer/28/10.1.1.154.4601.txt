fairly weak generic prior embodied sampling covariance enforced anatomic joint limits non interpenetration parts worked activities stronger models explored 
treat marker motion capture data ground truth worth noting true human motion somewhat elusive 
perfect marker motion capture data deriving location joints human body trivial task 
example hip joints defined measured mm accuracy marker protocol employed system 
true gold standard localizing position hip joints debated bio mechanics literature 
placement markers regular clothes limits calibration accuracy video cameras respect calibration may lead additional errors hard quantify 
currently unavailable clear methods simultaneously capturing video motion capture data necessary allow better ground truth lift need performing motion laboratory environment 
current research non marker methods capturing human motion may prove viable alternatives years
