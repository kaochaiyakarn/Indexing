searching distributed collections inference networks james callan lu bruce croft computer science department university massachusetts amherst ma usa cs umass edu information retrieval systems networked environments raises new set issues received little attention 
issues include ranking document collections relevance query selecting best set collections ranked list merging document rankings returned set collections 
describes methods addressing issue inference network model discusses implementation inquery system presents experimental results demonstrating effectiveness 
retrospective document retrieval usually described task searching single collection documents produce list documents ranked order relevance particular query 
need search multiple collections distributed environments increasingly important sizes individual collections grow network information services 
distributed collections relatively homogeneous case large single collection partitioned distributed local network improve search efficiency 
relevance judgements similar training queries determine retrieve collection 
technique may practical relatively static collections obtaining relevance judgements problematic widely distributed dynamic collections 
gloss estimates number potentially relevant documents collection boolean query jcj delta pi df jcj term df number documents containing jcj number documents gloss approach easily applied large numbers dynamic collections gloss stores term frequency information collection 
effectiveness known due limited evaluation lack support forms query 
moffat centralized index blocks documents individual collections :10.1.1.53.7407
example block documents concatenated 
new query retrieves block identifiers centralized index searches highly ranked blocks retrieve documents 
approach worked retrieving small numbers documents caused significant decrease precision recall documents retrieved 
set collections chosen retrieval system decide combine search results collection single ranking 
new query retrieves block identifiers centralized index searches highly ranked blocks retrieve documents 
approach worked retrieving small numbers documents caused significant decrease precision recall documents retrieved 
set collections chosen retrieval system decide combine search results collection single ranking 
task simple results unordered set documents difficult results ranked lists documents 
successfully document scores different collections create merged ranking problems approach :10.1.1.53.9005
voorhees call collection fusion problem describe solutions 
solution interleave rankings round robin fashion 
second solution uneven interleaving biased expected relevance collection query 
approach substantially effective experiments trec collection 
search complexity comparable searching small collections abstracts 
cori network document collections comparable searching known collection cacm abstracts 
tf df idf icf values higher affect computational complexity retrieval 
inverted lists match terms query accessed 
effectiveness approach ranking collections evaluated inquery retrieval system gigabyte trec document collection :10.1.1.33.5416
trec collection heterogeneous containing subcollections different sources periods time table 
subcollections vary widely size number documents average document length 
experiments conducted queries developed trec topics previous trec tipster evaluations 
inference network incorporate proximity information operators impractical collection ranking

mean squared error collection ranking single query calculated jcj delta sigma gamma optimal rank collection number relevant documents contained collection largest number relevant documents ranked collection second largest number relevant documents ranked rank collection determined retrieval algorithm set collections ranked 
mean squared error metric advantage easy understand optimal result require labeling collection relevant relevant particular query
