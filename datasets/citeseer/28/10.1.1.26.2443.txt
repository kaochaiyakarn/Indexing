hierarchical discriminant regression hwang member ieee weng member ieee main motivation propose new classification regression method challenging highdimensional data 
proposed new technique casts classification problems class labels output regression problems numeric values output unified regression problem 
unified view enables classification problems numeric information output space available regression problems traditionally readily available classification metric clustered class labels coarse fine classifications 
doubly clustered subspace hierarchical discriminating regression hdr method proposed 
major characteristics include clustering performed output space input space internal node termed doubly clustered 
clustering output space provides virtual labels computing clusters input space
