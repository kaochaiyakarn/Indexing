unified theory concurrency control recovery hans jorg schek gerhard weikum ye department computer science eth zurich ch zurich switzerland mail weikum inf ethz ch classical theory transaction management different independent criteria correct execution transactions 
criterion serializability ensures correct execution parallel transactions assumption failures occur 
second criterion strictness ensures correct recovery failures 
develop unified model allows reasoning correctness concurrency control recovery framework 
introduce correctness criteria prefix reducibility prefix expanded serializability investigate relationships classical criteria 
important advantage model captures schedules semantically rich adt actions addition classical read write schedules
