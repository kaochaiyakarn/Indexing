lip fr describes simulated line mapping system robot navigation 
system allows autonomous creation topological maps enhanced metrical information provided internal odometry external vision sonars sensors 
maps robot position represented calculated probabilistically algorithms inspired hidden markov models 
visual system simple allow reliable recognition speci places jointly odometry sonar recordings active perception system allows reliable localization robot starts exploring environment passively translated place 
advantages drawbacks current system discussed means
