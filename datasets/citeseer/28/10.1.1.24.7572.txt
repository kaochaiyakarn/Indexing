player scenario view captures antisocial agent intention better rival 
achieve higher degree flexibility describing analyzing antisocial agents useful think di erent degrees anti sociality aggressive anti sociality agent objective harm competitors cost moderate anti sociality agent puts somewhat emphasis profit loss agents 
considerations lead formal specification antisocial agent agent antisocial attitude agent tries maximize weighted di erence profit profit competitors 
precisely antisocial agent intends maximize payo payo profit profit payo non antisocial agent simply profit 
parameter called rate :10.1.1.32.6354
rate formally captures allows modify agent degree antisocial behavior 
obvious formula covers regular agents setting 
higher hurting greater priority helping 
purely destructive agent defined 
suppose antisocial agent knows lowest private values possibly 
ective bidding strategy agent bid 
strategy equilibrium arbitrary antisocial agents optimal strategy reduce possible losses occur worst case encounters 
balanced antisocial bidders participate auction process strategy nash equilibrium 
words agents apply strategy reason single agent deviate see proofs theorems :10.1.1.32.6354
obviously general case agent know private value bidders 
principle agent possibilities value instance means careful estimation auctioneer learning previous auctions 
deals technique 
consider auctioning fixed number tasks repeats rounds 
suppose antisocial agent loses auction round 
task auctioned subsequent auctions reduces bid round round small margin awarded contract receives amount assumes lowest private value displays modified strategy 
algorithm works somewhat stable dynamic lost start bid bid bid lost lost price won won price lost won price bid bid antisocial strategy repeated auctions ments agents vanish new ones appear time time 
step size equals private value algorithm emulates aggressive dangerous strategy uses zero bids generally careful agent small step size order safe competitor su ered huge losses negative profit 
reasonable setting depends number rounds distribution private values rate upper bound specified :10.1.1.32.6354
task execution contracts binding paying penalty leveled commitment contracting unavoidable loss agent produces cheapest competitor reduced breaking negative contract 
due fact reason closing deal private value agent agent incentive really accomplish task 
contractee break contract loss accepting contract greater penalty pays breaking deal 
supposing common definition penalty fraction contract value agent better contract pr actual task price pr penalty rate 
bidders stay bidding private value lose money rounds 
behavior described seen opposite bidder collusion bidders coordinate bids order help 
contrast antisocial agents bid intention harm
