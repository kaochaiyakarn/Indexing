edu technical report dcs tr department computer science rutgers university rd piscataway nj storage technology trends providing massive storage extremely small packages declining computing costs resulting rising number devices person 
confluence trends presenting new critical challenge storage file system designers enable users effectively manage share huge amounts data stored multitude devices 
novel middleware storage system planetp designed principles peer semantically indexed storage layer 
planetp novel design choices meet challenge 
costs especially administrators ignored ad hoc groups users limited resources 
key elements success client server model traced back ability allow small medium sized groups share information 
planetp designed scale level allowing group trusting users manage single storage volume multiple machines laptops devices 
target regime devices possibly spread internet 
targeting community sizes nodes large systems targeted efforts oceanstore chord past allows assume member track membership entire group :10.1.1.147.1879:10.1.1.115.4299
planetp takes advantage assumption diffuse individuals summaries content form bloom filters members group :10.1.1.20.2080
approach advantages 
peer line peers know contains information searching 
second searches place little load community large bulk data changes slowly searching peer query local store bloom filters contact peers matching snippets directly

peer line peers know contains information searching 
second searches place little load community large bulk data changes slowly searching peer query local store bloom filters contact peers matching snippets directly 
disadvantage diffusion approach may take time spread new information 
requires information spread community 
address concerns peers planetp collaborate implement information brokerage service consistent hashing :10.1.1.147.1879
approach similar spirit taken 
order export known api process implementing file system allows users build hierarchical semantic directory structure top planetp 
describe current status file system breezefs leverages planetp provide content addressable way build directories breezefs directory represents collection files represents collection files logically related content 
sub directories represent refined queries content 
feature useful example breezefs extensive keywords appearing document text 
currently keys planetp handles text strings 
intend extend planetp allow typing keys xml tags plan build automatic keyword extraction 
planetp uses mechanisms index data store 
peer planetp summarize keys associated snippets peer published bloom filter community :10.1.1.20.2080
peer query content community querying bloom filters collected 
diffusion maintain membership information peers peer maintains local list active members 
absence joins departures members eventually local directory set bloom filters 
global diffusion approach advantage placing little load community searches bulk slowly changing data 
diffusion maintain membership information peers peer maintains local list active members 
absence joins departures members eventually local directory set bloom filters 
global diffusion approach advantage placing little load community searches bulk slowly changing data 
disadvantage diffusion approach new rapidly changing information spreads slowly diffusion necessarily spread time minimize spikes communication bandwidth 
address problem peers planetp implement information brokerage service uses consistent hashing publish locate information :10.1.1.147.1879
second indexing service supports timely location new information exchange information subsets peers involving entire community 
query posed planetp performs searches 
uses list bloom filters compute subset peers may snippets match query forwarding query subset 
second contacts appropriate information broker key query 
bulk failures occurred community joining leaving 
experiment shows brokerage service quite robust face dynamic changes community membership 
normal circumstances expect members community actively joining leaving 
breezefs implemented breezefs middleware semantic file system top planetp validate utility 
breezefs provides similar functionality semantic file system defined gifford :10.1.1.128.8654
breezefs novelty lies fact provides content querying dynamic community users user data potentially distributed multitude devices requiring centralized indexing 
call breezefs middleware system manage storage directly 
files stored local file system device files shared community published breezefs uses planetp possible entire community search files content 
semantic file system directory created breezefs user poses query 
currently ing remove limitation building query sub directory equivalent refining query containing directory 
example user created directory query creates sub directory query file system content sub directory include files match query file system 
shows breezefs basic architecture comprised components explorer file indexer file server semantic file system 
user publishes file breezefs passes file indexer takes textual contents file separates set keys 
currently file indexer index text pdf postscript files noted functionality file indexer arbitrarily extended users :10.1.1.128.8654
published file indexed breezefs gives local pathname file file server basically simple web server 
file file server returns url 
get request arrives url file server returns content pub file 
breezefs embeds url xml snippet publishes planetp extracted keys 
time shown breezefs time required peer persistent query posted key published brokerage service notified new file 
keep set keys published brokerage service small say order keys publication quite fast ms keys 
believe number heavily optimized 
currently keys published brokers time concurrency linear increase publication time
