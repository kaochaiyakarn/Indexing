real time performance existing hybrid architectures optimal capability reactive components fully exploited 
extreme cases workload high level planning module far exceeds low level reactive module :10.1.1.30.8073
planning module plans exact motion path generates detailed sequence actions executed actuators 
reactive module performs single task obstacle avoidance making minor modifications course action
