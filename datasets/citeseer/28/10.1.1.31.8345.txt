scheme provides serializability external consistency committed transactions uses loosely synchronized clocks achieve global serialization 
stores single version object avoids maintaining concurrency control information basis tracks invalidations client basis approach low memory space overhead object disk overhead 
addition low space overheads scheme performs 
presents simulation study compares scheme adaptive callback locking best concurrency control scheme client server object oriented database systems studied date 
study shows scheme outperforms adaptive callback locking low moderate contention workloads scales better number clients 
distributed object oriented database system persistent storage objects provided server machines applications run clients client caching needed provide performance applications

real time order 
scheme optimistic algorithm uses backward validation :10.1.1.101.8988
performs better concurrency control algorithms important class workloads low moderate contention user transactions 
scheme uses timestamps generated local clocks define serial order transactions assume clocks loosely synchronized case networks today 
approach simpler cheaper previous techniques techniques discussed section 
importantly timestamps allow truncate transaction history avoid spurious aborts 
simple protocol allows recover information lost acks 
transaction commits causes invalidations server generates invalidation number stored transaction commit record invalidation numbers larger earlier ones 
invalidation number included invalidation message front ends remember number invalidation acknowledged server 
information sent server cached set allows server discard entries invalid set acknowledged front

distributed schemes achieve global serialization order atomic multicast logical clocks 
atomic multicast adds additional message overhead logical clocks explicitly managed part phase commit complicating algorithm 
scheme described approach validate transaction participant computes set validating transactions conflicts waits commit abort commit decision 
scheme described approach validate transaction participant computes set validating transactions conflicts waits commit abort commit decision 
process lead deadlocks resolved timeouts phase 
loosely synchronized clocks avoids problems importantly allows time dependent decisions transactions remove transaction history 
optimistic schemes classified forward backward validation schemes 
backward validation algorithms scheme proposed validate transaction committed transactions forward validation algorithms pl validate transaction currently executing transactions :10.1.1.101.8988
approaches validate validating transactions 
client server system forward validation requires validating transaction contact clients caching updated objects obtain latches cached copies 
latch obtained transaction aborts commits releases latches updating invalidating client caches 
approach adds additional validation phase commits single server involved delay incurred observed committing client
