nested relational complex object database nested tuples sets represent real world objects 
various reasons tuples sets partial complete 
discuss support deductive databases 
particular deductive database language rlog ii supports partial complete tuples sets relationlog 
tuples sets partial complete 
past years sub problem database contains partial complete tuples partial sets investigated depth 
specific operators union join introduced integrate partial information 
complete sets supported sets treated simply partial sets 
sub problem database contains partial complete sets complete tuples investigated relationlog :10.1.1.40.2037
operator called grouping integrate partial sets complete sets 
partial tuples consistency checking considered 
focus general problem combining sub problems uniform framework study support partial complete tuples sets deductive databases
