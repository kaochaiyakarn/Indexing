predicate implemented subroutine uses content url string web page order determine relevant crawl 
assumed user flexibility providing module computes predicate 
assume pages crawled corresponding information predicate satisfaction pages candidate crawled ignored calculation 
web pages satisfy predicate corresponding interest ratio 
similarly gammam web pages satisfy predicate corresponding interest ratio delta gamma 
final interest delta gammam sibling learning sibling interest ratio idea candidate satisfy predicate siblings satisfy 
parent children satisfy predicate hub place find relevant resources :10.1.1.120.3875

web random number siblings expect satisfy predicate delta 
higher number siblings satisfy predicate indicative parents hub increases probability candidate satisfying predicate 
compute interest ratio observation rule number siblings satisfy predicate expected random assumption positive evidence candidate satisfy predicate

purpose providing frame nature specificity predicates included results random crawling technique 
random crawler candidates fetched random order 
experiments show set predicates random crawler obtains average hit ratio 
effectively means randomly crawled pages relevant predicate 
especially case content url token learning methods noise thresholding techniques built 
different points crawl composite created domination individual factor best moment time 
results cumulative advantage single factor evaluated period crawling 
reuse learning information world wide web dynamic entity may case queries executed repeatedly period time 
focused crawling new crawl start scratch amount information :10.1.1.33.7805
learning crawler collects information relates features sibling pages candidate predicate satisfaction probability expected reuse data collected previous crawls crawler initial learning effort reduced 
example case illustrated 
predicate sports category starting seed corresponds www com 
clear curve reuses information previous crawl starts high predicate satisfaction probability

collecting data web pages crawled crawler learning information showed harvest rate crawler information showed harvest rate 
clear advantage learning crawler memory crawl effectively crawls 
clearly leverage crawling techniques discussed inherently non learning static nature :10.1.1.33.7805

summary proposed intelligent crawling technique uses self learning mechanism dynamically adapt particular structure relevant predicate
