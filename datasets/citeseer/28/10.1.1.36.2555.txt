initial discussion proposed model schemata associated

space time supplied model degrades multiple static schema model tex optional user supplied label supplied degrade schema versioning space time 
furthermore time supplied model degrades conventional temporal schema versioning la :10.1.1.177.1882

precisely completed relation scheme relation scheme contains minimal union explicit attributes de ned relevant spatiotemporal span relation

data source constructs conceptual schema encoding semantic information available outer world

suitable mechanism example rewriting rules tex put returned information global schema 
wrappers convert data sources single mediator may manage global schema interschema relationships perform necessary query rewriting 
procedural structural arrangement data concerned query declarative semantic operation may represent information available
