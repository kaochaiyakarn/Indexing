imag fr presents language expressing temporal pattern matching queries set temporal grouping operators structuring histories calendar criteria 
pattern matching queries shown useful reasoning successive events time temporal grouping may aggregate data time dimension display histories 
combination capabilities allows express complex queries involving succession time calendar conditions simultaneously 
operators embedded tempos temporal data model illustrated examples taken geographical application 
depending systems structuration temporal data facilities offered manage complete 
hierarchy temporal types proposed generally poor notion granularity taken account 
furthermore systems database state represents snapshot modeled world partially supported french defined update 
need maintaining data evolution arises history managed application level increases data programs complexity 
temporal data models dbms aim overcoming lack capabilities :10.1.1.48.3840
tempos temporal extension model persistent object servers extensible temporal data model integrating basic concepts facilities required manage data historical dimensions top dbms 
main goal tempos provide testbed defining temporal operators studying suitability regard concrete applications requirements 
temporal grouping pattern matching operators show may embedded tempos data model illustrate examples taken gis application 
temporal grouping allows structure history temporal criteria
