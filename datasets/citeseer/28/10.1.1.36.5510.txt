classification approach falls short supporting emerging data intensive applications requiring advanced dynamic capabilities 
advanced capabilities support modeling subjectivity ability provide multiple perspectives application objects model socalled objects different stages exhibit different forms behavior 
article describes extended approach investigating purpose 
advanced features embodied dynamic versatile role facilities introduced conventional object oriented model facilitates specifying modeling applications natural incremental systematic way

object defined applying roles needed defining required inter role dependency relationships 
intuitively illustrates top bottom design methodologies second approach approach incorporating roles object oriented database 
prototyping efforts demonstrate feasibility utility developed experimental prototype systems called door adome support extended role facilities different approaches implementation bases :10.1.1.37.5925
