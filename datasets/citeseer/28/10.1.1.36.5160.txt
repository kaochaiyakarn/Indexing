treating constraints objectives single objective evolutionary optimization carlos mx de inform presents new approach handle constraints evolutionary algorithms 
new technique treats constraints objectives uses multiobjective optimization approach solve re stated single objective optimization problem 
new approach compared numerical evolutionary optimization techniques engineering optimization problems different kinds constraints 
results obtained show new approach consistently outperform techniques relatively small sub populations significant sacrifice terms performance 
keywords genetic algorithms constraint handling multiobjective optimization evolutionary optimization numerical optimization 
genetic algorithms gas quite successful wide range applications constrained optimization problems raises issues considerable amount research devoted years 
approach fit previous categories defined tha mapping method proposed kim husbands 
technique theoretical approach uses mappings transform feasible region shape facilitates search ga problem approach problems low dimensionality variables objective function explicit algebraic form clear extend technique handle difficult problems 
multiobjective optimization techniques approach objectives constraints handled separately 
main idea redefine single objective optimization multiobjective optimization problem objectives number constraints 
apply multiobjective optimization technique new vector fm fm original constraints problem :10.1.1.108.8521
ideal solution feasible assuming minimization 
sub populations old sub populations new genetic operators apply graphical representation approach introduced 
proposed pareto ranking vega handle constraints technique 
approach called population ranked constraint violations counting number individuals dominated solution
