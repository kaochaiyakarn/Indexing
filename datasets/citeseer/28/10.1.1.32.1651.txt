information manifold thomas kirk bell laboratories tk research att com alon levy bell laboratories levy research att com yehoshua sagiv hebrew university sagiv cs ac il divesh srivastava bell laboratories divesh research att com describe information manifold im system browsing querying multiple networked information sources 
contribution system demonstrates viability knowledge representation technology retrieval organization information disparate structured unstructured information sources 
organization allows user pose high level queries data multiple information sources 
second contribution describe novel query processing algorithms combine information multiple sources 
particular algorithms guaranteed find exactly set information sources relevant query completely exploit knowledge local closed world information etzioni 
currently explosion amount information available online 
presence descriptions information sources enables user pose high level queries sources capability distinguishes current browsers 
external information sources structured databases sgml documents viewed partially structured ftp sites bibliography files interesting issues arise efficient query answering 
im representation language enables describing semantic content structured sources way answer queries may involve accessing data multiple sources 
bulk describes query processor im answers user queries posed terms domain model information sources 
particular techniques answering queries contributions previous related ffl language representing contents information sources combination horn rules concepts classic description logic brachman :10.1.1.31.9028

furthermore sims modeled information sources description logic 
expressive power horn rules necessary order model information sources relational databases 
furthermore techniques determining relevance sufficiently general incorporate horn rules expressive description logics consider queries involving negation statements describing rela information sources 
ffl local closed world information introduced etzioni enables express fact information source complete knowledge part domain 
example portion manhattan ny directory information source provides telephone numbers area code relevant conjunction constraints ac description manhattan source ac query unsatisfiable 
extensions useful relationships information sources containment disjointness help reduce set information sources need accessed order answer query 
results levy sagiv compute minimal set sources relationships described knowledge base 
results levy determine relevant portions external source relations queries extended include negation 
results levy compute set relevant sources cases relations representing information sources appear consequents rules :10.1.1.54.6954
