propose algorithm distributed reinforcement learning distributing representation value function nodes 
node system ability sense state locally choose actions locally receive reward locally goal system maximize sum rewards nodes time 
node allowed give neighbors current estimate value function states passes 
value function learning rule information allows node learn value function estimate weighted sum rewards nodes network 
representation node choose actions improve performance system
