automated collaborative filtering addresses drawbacks model recommendations users assign ratings items 
system uses ratings find users similar user uses opinions recommendations

researchers machine learning suggested recommendation problem cast classic problem classification 
applied number machine learning techniques including inductive learning clustering neural networks bayesian networks :10.1.1.36.4620:10.1.1.21.4665:10.1.1.21.4665:10.1.1.33.4026
approaches tend employ probabilistic models 
personality diagnosis assumes users report ratings error forms neighborhoods computing probability user type users system 
probabilistic clustering similar assumes users fall fixed number types uses expectation maximization em estimate probabilities user personality type ratings 
general cf algorithms machine learning techniques perform slightly better original correlation methods
