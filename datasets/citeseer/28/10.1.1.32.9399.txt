bagging predictors leo breiman technical report september partially supported nsf dms department statistics university california berkeley california bagging predictors leo breiman department statistics university california berkeley bagging predictors method generating multiple versions predictor get aggregated predictor 
aggregation averages versions predicting numerical outcome plurality vote predicting class 
multiple versions formed making bootstrap replicates learning set new learning sets 
tests real simulated data sets classification regression trees subset selection linear regression show bagging give substantial gains accuracy 
vital element instability prediction method 
perturbing learning set cause significant changes predictor constructed bagging improve accuracy
