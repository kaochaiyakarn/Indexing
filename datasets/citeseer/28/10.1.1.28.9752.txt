learning web query processing lu chen department computer science department computer science hong kong university science technology university hong kong china china cs ust hk cs ust hk edu cn edu cn describe novel web query processing approach learning capabilities 
approach user queries form keywords search engines employed find urls web sites contain required information 
urls user browsing 
query processor learns information required user way user navigates hyperlinks locate information 
learned knowledge processes rest urls produces precise query results form segments web pages user involvement 
preliminary experimental results indicate approach process range web queries satisfactory performance 
copy republish requires fee special permission endowment 
proceedings th international conference large databases cairo egypt information source 
day huge number people search web information interest news prices goods research papers excitement electronic commerce growing internet common platform conducting business 
usage web increase dramatically 
search engines widely locate information web :10.1.1.109.4049
unfortunately users retrieving information database systems searching web frustrating 
example find lowest price certain part database simple sql statement job 
may cost hours search lowest price web stamina find 
problem search web search engines return large hit lists low precision 
dissimilarity querying web querying database caused fundamental differences web database system remain researchers different disciplines trying improve situation 
wide range research reported ir improve effectiveness querying web including developing better classification mechanisms building effective indices better searching strategies ranking functions intelligent agent help users originated ai community 
context querying web agents learn user profiles models user search behaviors employ learned knowledge predicate urls may interesting information providing suggestions users 
assistant agents syskill webert webwatcher help users interactive mode 
assistant agents fab heuristics autonomously find interesting pages :10.1.1.43.7796
researchers database community take approach 
view web large distributed database system apply database technologies web queries 
related efforts include web query language design wrapper generation 
web query languages classified generations 
generation including ql websql aimed unify content queries link structure queries 
second generation web query language weboql struql ability access structure web objects create new complex structures query results 
research wrapper generation tackles fundamental difficulty querying web web pages structured schema describes contents web pages 
exploits formatting information web pages hypothesis underlying structure page 
structure wrapper facilitates queries page generated :10.1.1.35.6633
various issues web query processing different approaches tackling issues describe efforts build online query processing system enables users query web ease obtain results database fashion 
proposed approach user issues key word query probably precise 
passed general search engine yahoo 
search engine returns urls web pages contain requested information 
weighting scheme determined position component contains term number terms component description 
term weight accumulated browsing processes 
navigation knowledge represented set term weight pairs stored navigation knowledge base 
classification knowledge task examining segment meets query requirements cast bayesian learning framework provided performance text hypertext applications 
different models multi variate bernoulli model multinomial model framework reported :10.1.1.46.1529
report multinomial model usually outperforms multi variate bernoulli model 
adopt multinomial model 
classification knowledge knowledge bayesian classifier 
classification knowledge takes form set triplets ni ni ni number occurrences content queried segments ni number occurrences content segments meet query requirements 
function max keep descriptive information segments links 
average function weights returned choose max function relevance segment link conveyed words 
convention html pages short informative sentence fragments especially true lists headings hyperlinks result function segment link assigned weight expected best represent relevance 
application classification knowledge function calls na bayesian classifier apply classification knowledge multiple segments 
classifier adopted modification :10.1.1.46.1529
