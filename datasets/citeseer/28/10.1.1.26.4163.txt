case reasoning adapted problems experience extensively represents domain knowledge weak domain theory available 
control learning planning investigated machine learning case reasoning :10.1.1.27.6143
optimisation differs planning nature planning focuses achieve solutions local search optimisation solutions usually constructed easily task find ones 
consequence operator constructing solutions necessary best choice 
abandon completely focusing learning single operators
