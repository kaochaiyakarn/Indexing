growing interest semantic query caches aid query evaluation 
semantic caches simply results previously asked queries selected relational information chosen evaluation strategy cached locally 
complex environments distributed heterogeneous databases data warehousing semantic caches promises help optimize query evaluation increase users reduce network load resource usage 
general logical framework semantic caches 
consider relational operations caches answering queries consider various ways answer partially answer query cache 
happens query cache semantically related 
semantically unrelated cache answer query 
instance consider relations employee stock holder 
assume base relations views 
contents employee table way affects stock holder query called remainder query trimmed query :10.1.1.128.9102:10.1.1.45.1534
godfrey gryz query cache cache query cache query case cache query case cache query case query cache case case case fig 

possible relations cached current queries 
table vice versa 
views may defined part base relations 
query employs views cache may able determine semantically share answers 
furthermore able determine query expression evaluable cache retrieves answers 
topic 
expressing queries caches logical formalism employ analytical tools developed logic databases decide cache combination thereof answers partially answers query :10.1.1.127.3070:10.1.1.49.6407
basic inference needed containment determination extensional conjunctive queries called conjunctive query containment say query contained query answers answers containment test sufficient simplest case single cache extensional refer views partially answers query 
joins queries caches composed views requires sophisticated inferencing 
applications critical optimization heterogeneous multi database environments 
helps address issues arise mediated distributed environments 
exists cache expression idb answers abbreviation retrieved cache 
case query completely answered cache stated 
combination conditions answers retrieved cache finite collection cache expressions en idb 
en idb ng 
condition establishes equivalence union known general procedure establishing equivalence queries testing containment directions :10.1.1.127.3070:10.1.1.49.6407
ultimate goal applications answer query entirely caches formula 
half formula satisfied 
semantic overlap semantic independence consider cases query cache expression overlap contained direction 
different ways may overlap 
call overlap formula horizontally complete iff free variables free variables 
case 
call abbreviated overlap abbreviation horizontally complete 
case 
abbreviated overlaps useful willing answer part query attributes interest :10.1.1.49.6407
call queries semantically independent respect idb iff intensionally overlap respect idb way 
case 
note necessary semantic overlap defined introduce notion semantic independence 
note definition query formula allow disjunction negation tautology contradiction 
semantically independent answers retrieved cache may recomputed server 
applications considered negation 
introduce discussion section 
query evaluate answers minus gamma gamma standard relational set minus operator 
general concept called remainder query :10.1.1.45.1534
mean discounting mean gamma 
semantic query caches caching secure data semantic independence enforced costs 
applications particular query optimization cost effectiveness important may willing recompute answers efficient resources 
extreme enforce semantic independence define may expensive evaluate shown example capture intended mean query overlaps cache removed 
containment intensional queries respect datalog program computationally harder containment question undecidable 
datalog program contained extensional conjunctive query doubly exponential 
extension query containment problem problem rewriting query means queries 
known query folding 
problem considered context heterogeneous database systems query rewriting materialized views :10.1.1.33.1999:10.1.1.31.5531:10.1.1.38.7636:10.1.1.54.6954
cases extensional conjunctive queries considered 
practical issues query overlaps considered context multiple query optimization 
goal optimize evaluation batch set queries 
developed techniques geared finding reusing common sub expressions set queries heuristics 
developed techniques restricted subset extensional conjunctive queries 
self joins permitted 
techniques find queries contained original query 
adms system described includes query caching system 
extend paradigm query caching caches provide partial answers query :10.1.1.128.9102:10.1.1.45.1534
assume semantic cache useful query answers obtained single cache project select operations 
framework allows efficient implementation semantic caching guarantee query answers available caches 
semantic caching strategies designed explicitly purpose query optimization 
applications considered 

criteria intensional queries caches queries caches views pertinent data warehousing mediated environments 

extend notion partial answer account case subset requested attributes returned 
shown useful heterogeneous environments data sources available :10.1.1.49.6407

introduce new concept semantic overlap queries caches 
previously containment considered 
semantic overlap allows possibilities exploit caches answering queries
