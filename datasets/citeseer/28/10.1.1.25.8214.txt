recursion treated black box methods detailed analysis particular structure difficult capture regularities particular recursion maximally utilize information constraints recursion structures query evaluation 
project adopts different approach 
technique quite effective reducing search space logic programs involving multiple recursions 
comparison logic program implementation techniques best knowledge current implementations logic programming languages evaluate logic programs rule predicate order independent query fashion finding complete set answers terminate properly 
studies deductive databases developed bottom query evaluation method magic sets method variations efficient evaluation recursions 
method applies set oriented processing confines search portion database relevant query evaluates query mode independent function free logic programs completely correctly

coral constructed approach 
normalizing recursions performing detailed analysis behavior compiled recursions difficult fully explore query constraints behavior properties particular recursion particular query evaluation may encounter great challenges evaluating sophisticated function bearing logic programs 
example magic sets method evaluate recursion predicate order independent query mode independent fashion 
similar comments applied system adopts query subquery evaluation approach
