sift document filtering system known vector space retrieval model :10.1.1.21.2462
sift queries unstructured query operators indexed inverted lists 
document retrieves set inverted lists indicate profiles evaluate document 
document score profile determined vector space algorithm 
score exceeds dissemination threshold matches profile routed user 
document retrieves set inverted lists indicate profiles evaluate document 
document score profile determined vector space algorithm 
score exceeds dissemination threshold matches profile routed user 
sift incorporates relevance feedback algorithms enable user refine profile relevant nonrelevant documents 
architecture document filtering system inference network model information retrieval filtering :10.1.1.104.7500
major tasks performed creation query networks creation document network networks filter documents 
document network created automatically mapping documents content representation nodes implemented traditional inverted lists 
query networks specified user natural language structured query language 
document filtering performed recursive inference propagate belief values inference net discarding documents belief dissemination threshold 
filtering document involves profile selection evaluation 
profile selection determines profiles evaluate profile evaluation determines document satisfies profile 
optimized restrict attention profile selection 
document goal spend time nearly time profiles 
approach example sift index profiles inverted lists :10.1.1.21.2462
