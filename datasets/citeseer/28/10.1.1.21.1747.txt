output coding general framework solving multiclass categorization problems 
previous research output codes focused building multiclass machines predefined output codes 
discuss time problem designing output codes multiclass problems 
design problem discrete codes extensively previous works negative results 
introduce notion continuous codes cast design problem continuous codes constrained optimization problem 
dietterich bakiri described general approach error correcting codes termed error correcting output coding ecoc short output cod ing 
output coding multiclass problems composed stages 
training stage need construct multiple supposedly independent binary classifiers different partition set labels disjoint sets 
second stage classification part predictions binary classifiers combined extend prediction original label test instance 
experimental shown output coding greatly improve standard reductions binary problems dietterich bakiri dietterich kong kong dietterich aha bankert schapire dietterich berger schapire singer :10.1.1.32.8860:10.1.1.57.5909:10.1.1.22.4864
performance output coding analyzed statistics learning theoretic contexts hastie tibshirani james hastie schapire singer 
previous output coding concentrated problem solving multiclass problems predefined output codes independently specific application class hypotheses construct binary classifiers 
output code ignore complexity induced binary problems 
output codes experiments typically confined specific family codes
