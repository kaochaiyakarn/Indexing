evolutionary algorithm multivariate discretization decision rule induction marek institute computer science technical university poland ii pb pl 
describe md evolutionary algorithm system learning decision rules databases 
main novelty approach lies dealing continuous valued attributes 
decision rule learners univariate discretization methods search threshold values attribute time 
contrast md simultaneously searches threshold values continuous valued attributes inducing decision rules 
call approach multivariate discretization 
dataset contains numerical continuous valued attributes decision rule learner search threshold values create conditions selectors concerning attributes 
process called discretization attracted lot attention literature 
simplest discretization algorithm called equal interval binning partitions range continuous valued attribute equal sized intervals 
class labels belongs group unsupervised methods 
experimental studies show supervised methods class membership examples perform better unsupervised counterparts :10.1.1.47.6141
supervised discretization performed globally induction rules dividing range continuous valued attribute intervals independent attributes 
alternative approach called local supervised discretization consists searching attribute thresholds generation inductive hypothesis 
systems method unable search time threshold values attribute 
approaches belong group univariate discretization methods
