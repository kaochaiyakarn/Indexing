matthias jarke manfred jeusfeld christoph informatik rwth aachen aachen germany university le tilburg netherlands computer science division athens athens greece database researchers studied data warehouses dw role buffers materialized views mediating update intensive oltp systems query intensive decision support 
organizational role data warehousing means centralized information flow control 
consequence large number quality aspects relevant data warehousing expressed current dw meta models 
contributions solving problems 
firstly enrich meta data dw architectures explicit enterprise models 
secondly different mathematical techniques measuring optimizing certain aspects dw quality developed 
meta database store representation data warehouse applications terms perspective scheme 
architecture quality models represented telos extensible meta modeling language graphical syntax frame syntax mapped underlying formal semantics standard deductive databases 
formal semantics telos implementation conceptbase system provides query facilities definition constraints deductive rules 
telos suited allows formalize specialized modeling notations including adaptation graphical representations means meta classes 
conceptbase treats concepts including meta classes class objects suited manage representations dw objects measured :10.1.1.40.147
condensed conceptbase model architecture notation graph syntax telos 
bold arrows denote specialization links 
top level object classifies objects perspective conceptual logical physical level source data warehouse client 
perspective distinguish modules offers client model kinds information modules concepts subsumption relationships 
just text original approach encode quality query executable query data warehouse repository expressive deductive query language conceptbase 
answer quality query regarded evidence fulfillment quality goal 
simple kind quality query just evaluate current data warehouse object expected interval 
quality measurement uses metric unit average number null values tuple relation 
abstraction levels concepts quality model require closer consideration :10.1.1.40.147
standard software metrics function maps real world entity value domain usually number 
case maintain representations interesting real world entities dw repository 
quality measurements recorded explicit relationships representations measurable objects quality values 
nature quality measurement relates objects different abstraction levels
