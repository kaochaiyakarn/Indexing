property researchers attempted affine invariants recognition 
problems approach objects object classes inherent variability adequately treated invariants practice calculated affine invariants quite sensitive errors image plane measurements 
deciding hypothesis face done likelihood ratio 
results independent test images shown 
shows results faces significant rotations depth set parameters shape density 
deal large range head poses affine shape density affine invariant 
result interesting techniques designed frontal faces :10.1.1.110.5546:10.1.1.103.3872
detection rate algorithm face databases 
major reason somewhat low detection rate poor performance local facial feature detectors 
sophisticated techniques facial features definitely improve performance 
worth pointing algorithm shown able deal significant range head poses
