scalable trigger processing eric hanson chris lan huang mohan lloyd park albert cse cise department university florida gainesville fl hanson cise ufl edu www cise ufl edu hanson current database trigger systems extremely limited scalability 
proposes way develop truly scalable trigger system 
scalability large numbers triggers achieved trigger cache main memory effectively memory selection predicate index unique expression formats called expression signatures 
key observation large number triggers created structure appearance different constant values 
trigger created tuples added special relations created expression signatures hold trigger constants 
tables augmented database index main memory index structure serve predicate index 
main memory index 
non indexed database table 
indexed database table strategies implemented feasible process large numbers triggers containing predicate expressions signature data source predicate indexes constant set set unique constants predicate index root different constants mandatory scalable trigger system 
strategies required order common case triggers fast 
cost model illustrates tradeoffs hans :10.1.1.39.4584
strategies implemented triggerman strategies construction 

common sub expression elimination selection predicates important performance enhancement reduce total time needed determine selection predicates match token common sub expression elimination 
achieved normalizing predicate index structure 

trigger application design trigger system proposed designed highly scalable 
just programmers create large number triggers mean best approach 
triggers extremely regular structure may best create single trigger table data referenced trigger clause customize trigger behavior
