agents today internet world expanding rapidly 
agent developers proceed largely optimistic assumption agents error free 
errors may arise agents numerous reasons agents may share workspace agents humans updates entities may cause agent face situation explicitly programmed deal 
likewise errors coding agents may lead inconsistent situations unclear agent act 
unaffected requests may continue processed corrupted agent corrupted agent attempts recover 
section describe special repair data structures repair actions recovery component 
may selected repair action library provides host different realizations repair 
section discuss agent results tools previous section recover error 
show impact agents may recovery methods modification kowalski sadri agent cycle incorporates desired properties recovery continuity :10.1.1.62.8517

informally means assigning xn values code call condition reordered evaluation left right possible see appendix 
infsys rr relevance agent frameworks shown define error tolerant agent decision cycle apply impact agents corrupted 
decision cycle allows agent continue processing unaffected requests conditions repairing state affected requests may processed effectively 
natural question ask results may applied agent frameworks

kowalski sadri unified agent architecture kowalski sadri analyze similarities differences rational reactive agent architectures propose unified architecture aims capture special cases 
agent reasoning captured proof procedure logic programming style search engine reduce goals subgoals rational manner 
complete proof reduction procedure papers observation cases possible replace goal equivalent set condition action rules problem controlling reasoning process works correctly bounded resources addressed
