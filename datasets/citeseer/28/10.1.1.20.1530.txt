focus context technique hyperbolic geometry visualizing large hierarchies 
new focus context fisheye technique visualizing manipulating large hierarchies 
technique assigns display space portion hierarchy embedding context entire hierarchy 
essence scheme lay hierarchy uniform way hyperbolic plane map plane circular display region 
supports smooth blending focus context continuous redirection focus 
developed effective procedures manipulating focus pointer clicks interactive dragging smoothly animating transitions manipulation 
problem related hierarchies organization charts directory structures large display entirety computer screen 
conventional display approach maps hierarchy region larger display uses scrolling move region 
approach problem user see relationship visible portion tree entire structure auxiliary views 
useful able see entire hierarchy focusing particular part relationship parts seen focus moved parts smooth continuous way 
number focus context display techniques introduced fifteen years address needs types information structures :10.1.1.48.5954
focus context techniques including document lens perspective wall sarkar applied browsing trees laid conventional layout techniques 
problem satisfactory conventional layout large tree exponential growth 
leaf nodes adequate spacing nodes near root placed far apart high level tree structure leaving nice way display context entire tree 
cone tree modifies approach embedding tree dimensional space
