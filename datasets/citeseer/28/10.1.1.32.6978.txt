restriction removed considering elaborate model theoretic treatment similar strati cation approach similar overriding concept developed :10.1.1.115.3586
parametric inheritance provides additional formal basis belief function introduced 
intuitively rules containing atoms placed highest possible stratum belief computation kicks completely computed 
computation atoms depends atoms scenario complicated possibly settle multiple minimal models
