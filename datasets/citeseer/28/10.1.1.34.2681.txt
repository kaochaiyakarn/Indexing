knowledge approach designing intelligent team training systems yin michael miller thomas john yen richard department computer science texas university college station texas yen cs edu presents knowledge approach designing team training systems intelligent agents 
envision computer training system teams trained putting scenarios allow practice team skills 
important roles intelligent agents play virtual team members tutors 
carry functions agents equipped understanding task domain team structure selected decision making process beliefs team members mental states 
existing agent teamwork models incorporate elements listed focused analyzing information needs team members support proactive agent interactions 
encode team knowledge developed representation language bdi model called mallet 
approach components 
introduce team description language called mallet multi agent logic language encoding teamwork defines syntax encoding teamwork team ontology 
language provide relations role responsibility stage plans operators describing domain ideal team behavior 
ontology defines semantics predicates encoding teamwork 
methods automatically generating coordinated joint intentions contract nets multi agent decision theory take knowledge approach interested structured domains defined roles documented procedures virtual agents able interact human communicate realistic ways explicit representation goal hierarchies intentions important diagnosing problems team behavior providing useful feedback :10.1.1.14.3667
tambe focuses establishing joint intentions team members trying achieve joint goal information needs team member order provide information proactively 
focus approach 
second description team mallet define interpreter converts description executable form 
general belief reasoning theorem proving high computational complexity
