multi faceted insight interoperable visual information analysis paradigms beth paul whitney jim thomas pacific northwest national laboratory gain insight understanding complex information collections users able visualize explore facets information 
presents novel visual methods information analyst perspective 
sample scenario various methods gain variety insights large information collection 
conclude single paradigm visual method sufficient analytical tasks 
suite integrated methods offers better analytic environment today emerging culture information overload rapidly changing issues 
conclude interactions visual paradigms equally important important paradigms 
visualization collection main topics projected space form vertices framework see 
cosmic simplify image topic names hidden 
interactive prototype ability rotate zoom structure substantially increases appeal understandability visualization 
steps creating visualization identify topics create context vectors topics documents 
context vectors documents derived multitude techniques example see deerwester context vectors topics obtained natural adjunct document context vector :10.1.1.108.8490
visualization technique enable calculating contribution topic document context vector 
context vectors topics created principal components analysis transform topic vectors dimensional coordinates normalized dimensional coordinates 
document vector projected near topics closely related document 
dominant topics identified document 
example turned extremely useful examine hypercube coordinates galaxy coordinates vs time 
explicit support viewing time useful visualizations 
methods better highlighting differences visualizations helpful difference months 
interactions useful ability pull cosmic vertices framework explore connections 
related individual tools described compare broadly published tools follows cosmic potential viewing words documents space available latent semantic indexing tools described lin :10.1.1.108.8490
underlying methodology visualization cosmic intrinsically different 
hypercube tools described lin include ability represent documents respect concepts 
cat cone interface lets users search browse hierarchical ontology 
authors aware published visualizations large document collections respect ontology
