neuro mimetic navigation systems computational model rat hippocampus gerstner september neuro mimetic navigation systems computational model rat hippocampus gerstner propose bio inspired approach autonomous navigation components rats navigation 
spatial model environment constructed unsupervised hebbian learning 
representation consists population localized overlapping place elds modeling place cell activity rat hippocampus 
place elds established extracting spatio temporal properties environment visual sensory inputs 
visual ambiguities resolved means path integration 
reinforcement learning applied place cell activity goal oriented navigation
