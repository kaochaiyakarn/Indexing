new logic specifying behaviour multi agent systems 
logic agents viewed bdi systems state characterised terms beliefs desires intentions semantics bdi component logic known system rao georgeff 
addition agents available library plans representing know procedural knowledge achieve intentions 
plans effect programs specify group agents parallel achieve certain ends 
logic provides rich set constructs describing structure execution plans 
agent plan library represents procedural knowledge know 
plan contains parts body program defines course action descriptor states circumstances plan pre condition intentions plan may order achieve post condition 
interpreter responsible updating beliefs observations world generating new desires tasks basis new beliefs selecting set currently active desires subset act intentions 
interpreter select action perform basis agent current intentions procedural knowledge
