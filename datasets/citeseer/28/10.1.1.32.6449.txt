shows support routing approach useful 
noted users may prefer faqs exclusively simply prefer consider information peace quiet having involve conversations 
evaluate performance support routing approach interesting evaluate traditional precision recall measures

recall re defined percentage questions question answering system returns correct answer exists 
precision new measure called rejection defined percentage questions system correctly reports unanswered existing faq items 
faq finder system evaluated different domains measures 
willing sacrifice rejection high recall low matching threshold value expect reach recall 
combine result data rate duplicate questions question analysis find question answering system expected handle roughly questions 
may low number considering large domain support system believe result 
limited domains expect rate higher 
possible achieve better recall advanced information retrieval methods :10.1.1.47.9528
considering creation faq items assistants initially instructed create faq items questions general 
instruction turned vague interpreted different ways 
assistants expressed confusion questionnaire shown results 
noticed assistants thought difficult construct faq items find right category new items 
ag system extended second version called answer garden ag 
ag features mainly new functions considering automatic help sources form collaborative refinement system database sources user questions consideration 
features incorporated system interesting study
