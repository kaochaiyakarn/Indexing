database approach modeling querying video data said theoretical computer science avenue albert einstein rwth aachen aachen germany lyon fr informatik rwth aachen de indexing video data essential providing content access 
consider database technology offer integrated framework modeling querying video data 
concerns video modeling querying databases databases provide interesting angle attack problems 
video applications perspective database systems provide nice basis video systems 
generally database research provide solutions video issues partial fragmented 
database perspective video applications provide beautiful challenges

frame sequence viewed frame segment 
complex constraints built primitive atomic constraints logical connectives 
special symbol denote entailment constraints constraints write entails 
satisfiable constraint unsatisfiable 
techniques checking satisfiability entailment order constraints various domains studied 
regarding expressive power complexity linear constraint query languages see :10.1.1.90.8291
definition set order constraints domain 
set order constraint types constant typed set constants type denote set variables range finite sets elements typed 
set order constraints restricted form set constraints involving set functions 
note constraint derived form rewritten satisfaction entailment conjunctions set order constraints solved polynomial time quantifier elimination algorithm 
approach set sequencing templates predefined confine user exploration certain sequencing order 
problem approach domain dependent relies availability suitable template particular query
