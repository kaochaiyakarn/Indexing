field agent systems continues expand rapidly significant problems lies able compare evaluate relative benefits disadvantages different systems 
part due various different ways systems 
solution develop set architectural building blocks basis construction avoid re inventing wheels ensure strong effective simple accessible means presentation allows comparison analysis agent systems 
address issue providing just architectural framework apl agent programming language starting point identification specification general individual agent components 
provides additional benefits moves road implementation contributes growing library agent techniques features allows detailed comparison different agent systems specified similar ways 
plethora different agent theories languages architectures proposed developed years highlights particular problem 
reaction efforts receive part understandable 
argue key related reasons extremely difficult compare evaluate relative benefits disadvantages different agentbased systems result different approaches taken realise second focus theories architectures languages obscured need consider fundamental building blocks built 
attempting avoid pitfalls associated continual development agent languages architectures inadequate justification relation broader field working uniform perspective enable stronger inter relation comparison different systems approaches

consequence get uniform presentation apl language architecture clear concise way enables easily related compared systems 
believe moves step closer unified account different agent languages architectures 
note aim unified account unified languages systems 
contribution threefold 
illustrates formal specification enables key building blocks agent architectures identified allows comparison benefits weaknesses different agent frameworks expressive power agent languages
