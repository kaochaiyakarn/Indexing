cooperative coevolution multi agent systems han yong miikkulainen department computer sciences university texas austin austin tx usa compute cs utexas edu technical report ai certain tasks pursuit evasion multiple agents need coordinate behavior achieve common goal 
interesting question behavior best evolved 
agents controlled neural networks powerful method separate subpopulations test common task 
method called multi agent esp enforced subpopulations demonstrated prey capture task 
approach shown efficient robust evolving single central controller agents 
role communication domains studied shown unnecessary detrimental effective behavior task expressed role cooperation synchronization
