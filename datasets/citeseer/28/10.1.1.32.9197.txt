designing conversation policies joint intention theory ira smith apply semantics sketched smith cohen system conversational policies developed kaos :10.1.1.29.6263
show compositional nature speech acts semantics allows provide comprehensive semantics conversational policies generated semantics analyze policies alter policies show policies combined form complete dialogues protocol control strategies 
show semantics provides valuable tool analyze suggest corrections conversational policies 

research suggested conversations agents controlled finite state networks speech acts 
kaos system bradshaw uses finite state models construct set agent conversation schemas calls conversation policies 
process show joint intention semantics provides unambiguous meaning policies useful tool analyze policy consistency fitness particular task suggest ways policies linked form complex dialogues 
purpose inter agent conversation form team accomplish task 
joint intention theory provides vehicle describe mental states team participants 
communication acts supplied semantics theory method form maintain teams 
example previously shown conversation consisting request followed appropriate confirm places participants men tal states required team formation :10.1.1.29.6263
analysis revised offer conversation policy proves standing offer followed appropriate inform provides method form team

may want door open may locked open goal making request achieved succeeded making request 
attempt achieve goal attempting agent may retry attempt try strategy drop goal 
attempt succeed achieving intention agent committed

key ideas conversation policies provide level analysis abstracts precise propositional content agent communication language implementation individual conversations policies constructed offline help ensure reliable communication heterogeneous agents burden communication acts possible message conversational sequence 
conversation policies simplify design agent communications modules considerably complicated implement unrestricted agent dialogue models
