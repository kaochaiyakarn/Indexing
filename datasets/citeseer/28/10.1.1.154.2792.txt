customary abstraction xml documents focuses document structure consider document tree :10.1.1.35.7856
tree ordered unranked consider list tag number list entries unbounded means number children corresponding tree unbounded

dtds generalized dtds model dtd extended context free grammar 
context free grammar allows regular expressions right hand side productions 
illustrate shortcomings dtds recall example :10.1.1.35.7856
consider dtd dealers dealer dealer ad ad ad ad models list dealers advertisements new cars 
note right hand sides regular expressions mean kleene star set union respectively 
want specify derivation trees grammar dealer car ad 
specified dtds changing structure derivation trees 
generalized dtd defines derivation trees dealers car ad 
strings start capital letters nonterminals terminals dealers start symbol 
convenience denote regular languages leaves regular expressions 
dealers dealers dealer dealer ad ad ad ad regular languages expressions dealer respectively
