visual landmarks video tracking system relies may vary appearance different lighting conditions may visible night 
third importantly system designer control environment 
may possible modify environment 
example ar tracking systems rely placing special fiducial markers known locations environment example :10.1.1.39.575
approach practical outdoor applications

may able accurately measure objects interest environment 
inability control environment restricts choice tracking technologies 
experiments show tracking errors propagate rapidly extendible tracking pose calculation sensitive noise unstable 
shows errors camera position increase dynamic pose calibration errors propagate new scene features 
simulated experiment system starts tracking calibrated features 
camera rotated system estimates positions initially uncalibrated features placed volume 
green line shows errors camera positions computed estimated features point pose estimation method described :10.1.1.39.575
frames seconds inch accumulated error exceeds largest operating volume dimension 
performance may adequate compensate frames fiducial occlusion allow significant camera motion tracking area extension 
accurate pose estimates needed reduce error growth rate 
address pose problem developed new pose computation methods significantly improve performance dynamic calibration increase possibility achieving dof tracking unprepared environments
