data mining models services internet goal article raise debate usefulness providing data mining models services internet 
services provided adequate data expertise available internet 
instance yahoo altavista huge categorized document collection train document classifier provide model service internet 
way data mining accessible wider audience limited people data expertise 
host practical problems need solved idea 
identify close invitation debate investigation 
related concept exemplified ask expert sites net 
backed human experts answer questions posed users free fee 
goal automate mining models 
goals project overlap goals area distributed data mining closely related area multi agent learning 
projects underway large scale distributed data mining examples project mining enterprise data distributed internet project providing high performance networking computing testbed mining internet jam project developing java agent meta learning framework distributed mining project doing collective data mining stress learning vertically partitioned data :10.1.1.44.5728
field distributed data mining shares concerns web mining services especially area standardization model integration 
significant differences 
distributed mining projects focus model construction distributed fashion followed integration 
consequently stress protocols software architectures exchanging data partial models 
second better business www com www microsoft com data dm htm www crisp dm org www org www org tr soap business security infrastructure provides greater provider model data 
sharing summarized models raises fewer confidentiality concerns sharing raw data 
instance insurance scenario earlier credit willing share risk prediction model insurance raw data 
previously datasets available sharing albeit strict access control 
particular applications fraud detection competitive banks willing share data :10.1.1.44.5728
concern confidentiality user data 
example document classification scenario model freely sharable user deploying model security concerns shipping data service provider 
way convincing user service provider log data side
