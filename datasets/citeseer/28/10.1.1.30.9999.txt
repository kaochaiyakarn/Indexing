better understanding web resources server responses improved caching craig wills computer science department worcester polytechnic institute worcester ma cs wpi edu focuses characterizing information web resources server responses relevant web caching 
approach study set urls variety sites gather statistics rate nature changes compared resource type 
addition gather response header information reported servers retrieved resource 
results indicate potential reuse cached resources currently realized due inaccurate nonexistent cache directives

study general goal better understand nature resources change collection servers meta information reported servers reflects changes 
overriding goal obtain data better understand potential benefits caching existing software reaching potential 
specific directions investigation monitor selected resources study frequency resources change 
similar study done packet trace approach control requests test resources change md checksum contents determine changes occur :10.1.1.30.2529
examine availability accuracy cache validation information reported servers requested resources 
approach monitor response headers returned resource discover modification time size entity tag information 
availability information important efficiently validating cached resource modified ims get request 
previous studies percentage server responses contain resource vary 
examine images embedded resources change relative html resources contained 
prior indicates images change rate embedded images change container resources change 
study predictability locality changes resource 
particularly important resources change dynamically computed content 
techniques delta encoding html pre processing active caches proposed allow resources change frequently predictably cached :10.1.1.31.5701

example set images rotated container resource retrieval resource may show image removed page subsequent retrieval 
effective cache replacement policy needs able discover situation handle appropriately 
embedded resources preliminary results section indicate frequently changing pages exhibit deterministic predictable changes
