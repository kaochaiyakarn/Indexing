nested queries oo context usually translated nested algebraic expressions evaluated inefficient nested loops 
lesser extent relational query languages feature nested queries optimization considered 
nested queries object oriented context raise specific problems addressed 
differences models lead consider new optimization techniques 
propose phase optimization 
phase addresses new challenge related third difference stated 
phase apply dependency optimization transforms queries factoring constant locally constant nested queries common subexpressions 
new oo context factorization essential finding evaluation strategy :10.1.1.31.9395
resulting queries translated straightforward manner nested algebra 
algebra extension algebra features nice properties oo algebras lack associativity join operations 
second phase called algebraic optimization exploits new opportunities brought possibility represent non atomic attributes 
specifically applied algebraic equivalences extensive new powerful grouping operation 
section summarizes dependency optimization mainly means example 
section introduces algebra
