visual feature representations explored systems built 
research efforts establish basis cbir usefulness proposed approaches limited 
specifically efforts relatively ignored distinct characteristics cbir systems gap high level concepts low level features subjectivity human perception visual content 
proposes relevance feedback interactive retrieval approach effectively takes account characteristics cbir 
retrieval process user high level query perception subjectivity captured dynamically updated weights user feedback 
increases keyword annotation approach infeasible 
overcome difficulties annotation approach alternative mechanism content image retrieval cbir proposed early 
human assigned keywords cbir systems visual content images color texture shape features image index 
greatly alleviates difficulties pure annotation approach feature extraction process automatic image content consistent
