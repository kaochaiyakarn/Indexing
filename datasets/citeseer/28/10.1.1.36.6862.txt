intentions joint intentions role individual intentions intentions popular means describing behaviour rational problem solvers :10.1.1.32.8803
account important facets agent practical reasoning process 
firstly agents resource bounded continually weigh competing desires associated beliefs deciding 
point agent just settle state affairs aim creating commitment objective 
secondly intentions needed plan actions 
case team may know 
example consider situation group agents attempting lift table observes floor meaning objective attained 
agent reasonably assume team members able observation corresponding deduction 
member believes goal achievable team believe goal unachievable 
joint intentions overcome limitations individual intentions researchers started investigating joint intentions argued basic premises commitments conventions central joint intention basis coordination mechanisms :10.1.1.53.4144
joint intentions intuitively defined joint commitment perform collective action certain shared mental state 
means collaboration intrinsic property actions dependent mental state participants 
groups agents performing exactly actions acting collaboratively share necessary mental state 
previous addressed various aspects shared mental state individual formulation complete
