past games development driven need achieve realistic graphics 
resulted situation today games set visually photo realistic worlds norm 
game developers seek new games stand rest artificial intelligence playing far important role game design 
obvious application ai games creating non player characters 
visually worlds created computer games inhabiting worlds shallow uninteresting 
maintaining models hand allow continuous modelling solve problem 
similarly situation shown player encounters model maintained maintain realism 
player may encounter time periods model required 
key goal determining modelled order maintain realism believability
