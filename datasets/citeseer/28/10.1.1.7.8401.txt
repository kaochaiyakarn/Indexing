widely accepted semantics extension stable model semantics dddbs 
comes high expressive power dddbs stable model semantics allow expressing relational database properties complexity sigma 
shown practical relevance concrete real world situations represented dddbs disjunction 
furthermore dddbs strong connections ai non monotonic formalisms equivalently translated dddbs stable model semantics computing stable model semantics dddbs heart computation important ai problems cf
