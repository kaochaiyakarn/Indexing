conference management system open multiagent system supporting management various sized international conferences require coordination individuals groups 
distinct phases system operate submission review decision final collection 
submission phase authors notified receipt submission number 
deadline submissions passed program committee pc review papers contacting referees asking review number papers reviewing 
distribute papers task simply distributes accepted papers appropriate reviewers requested 
partitioner reviewers partition papers review papers assignments retrieve abstracts negotiate papers reviewer collector retrieve distrib papers get collect reviews reviews submit review collect papers review receive decision decision maker select papers author
