early approaches see see wysiwis enforced strict synchronization different users views shared workspace 
subsequent approaches relaxed wysiwis coupled techniques promoting multi user awareness concurrency control mechanisms interleaving users actions focussed enabling possibility collaboration retaining high degree individual autonomy :10.1.1.136.4728:10.1.1.136.4728:10.1.1.18.425:10.1.1.18.425
