easily adding animations interfaces constraints brad myers robert miller rich alan human computer interaction institute carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa af cs cmu edu www cs cmu edu amulet adding animation interfaces difficult task today toolkits situations useful effective 
amulet toolkit contains new form animation constraint allows animations added interfaces extremely easily changing logic application graphical objects 
animation constraint detects changes value slot attached causes slot take series values interpolated original new values 
advantage previous approaches animation constraints provide significantly better modularity reuse 
programmer independent control graphics animated start values animation path value space timing animation 
animations attached object existing widgets toolkit type value animated scalars coordinates fonts colors line widths point lists polygons booleans visibility library useful animation constraints provided toolkit including support exaggerated cartoon style effects slow slow anticipation 
amulet simply adding code position slots am left am top prototypes graphical objects rectangle prototype objects move smoothly old new positions animator am animator create rectangle prototype set am left am animate animator set am top am animate animator animation constraints matter new value set slot due program setting value user manipulating object mouse graphical constraint slot automatically recomputing value 
amulet allows multiple constraints slot animation constraint exist regular graphical constraint 
furthermore animation attached slot type slot 
addition obvious numerical slots positions sizes animations interpolate colors fonts pictures icon bitmaps point list polygon visibility changing graphical objects animated 
toolkits just easy animate preexisting objects buttons toolkit components libraries animate newly created objects :10.1.1.45.2342
briefly innovations approach increased modularity aspects animations separately specified 
ability add constraints type slot modifying object interaction including slots values calculated graphical constraint 
support animations wide range types values just numbers 
slot set new value animated animation interrupted new value arrives continue smoothly values 
built support undoing effects animations 
library animations attached objects including special effects slow slow anticipation follow various ways objects appear disappear 
effects adapted techniques 
related previous systems provided animation temporal constraints flexible easy amulet 
toolkit provides transition objects contain graphical object animated trajectory move object time interval pacing function :10.1.1.45.2342
generalizations architecture 
objects easily adding animations interfaces constraints appear uist animated programmer add special methods graphical objects animated start transition transition step transition 
amulet animation mechanism general easier supports animations kind value just positions objects animated writing new methods 
constraint mechanism implement animations
