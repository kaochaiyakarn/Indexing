online services suffer shortcomings due traditional search techniques 
users fail construct queries provide adequate accurate description job requirements leading imprecise search results 
investigate potential solution combines implicit profiling methods automated collaborative filtering acf techniques build personalised query job recommendations 
acf strategies implemented evaluated domain 
online services emerged successful popular information services internet providing job comprehensive database jobs dedicated search engine 
casper focuses enhancing existing system different ways improving existing database search facility case reasoning cbr fuzzy matching capabilities personalised automated collaborative filtering acf techniques proactively recommend new jobs users 
overview casper see 
focus second enhancements 
specifically investigate role acf casper core query recommendation service 
briefly acf feature free recommendation technique recommends information items user similar users previously liked :10.1.1.109.6332
success acf critically availability high quality user profiles contain graded lists information items shown high expected overlap related profiles 
dynamic database jobs limited life span means expected overlap related users small see 
discuss problematic common form acf describe solution investigated casper 
user profiling casper user profiles primary knowledge source acf system 
partial user profile showing basic graded profiling information 
casper collects types relevancy information revisit data amount times user accessed information item shown indicate interest item 
information collected casper misleading data clicks repeated clicks job description downloading removed job fig 

data sensitive measure relevancy gained read time data reported correlate user interest :10.1.1.109.6332
casper calculates read time information noting time difference successive requests user fig 

suitable thresholding technique needed eliminate spurious read times example user logging

memory acf direct relationships memory acf probably simplest form general acf approach 
users related basis direct similarity profiles example measuring degree overlap profile items measuring correlation coefficient grading lists 
leads lazy form acf nearest neighbour nn strategy 
currently casper uses simple overlap metric calculate similarity 
relevancy information pearson correlation coefficient compared similarity measure simple overlap metric relevancy information :10.1.1.40.5215
items items items items overlap profiles target profile nearest users base profiles identified jobs target profile ranked jobs occur frequently base profiles jobs occur similar profiles target profile
