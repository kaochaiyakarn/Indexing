kl temporal logic knowledge 
addition usual connectives linear discrete temporal logic contains set unary modal connectives representing knowledge possessed agents 
logic bl somewhat similar temporal logic contains connectives representing beliefs agents 
proof methods logics involve key steps 
secondly family resolution rules deal interactions various operators logics 
addition description normal form proof methods short worked examples proposals 
presents logics called kl bl respectively gives proof methods 
logic kl temporal logic knowledge 
addition usual connectives linear discrete temporal logic kl contains indexed set unary modal connectives allow represent information possessed group agents :10.1.1.92.5289
connectives satisfy analogues axioms modal system widely recognized logic idealized knowledge 
reason call kl temporal logic knowledge
