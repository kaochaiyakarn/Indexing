adaptation techniques intrusion detection intrusion response systems daniel information technology operations center united states military academy curtis carver jr jeffrey udo department computer science texas university examines techniques providing adaptation intrusion detection intrusion response systems 
attacks computer systems increasingly numerous sophisticated growing need intrusion detection response systems dynamically adapt better detect respond attacks 
adaptive hierarchical agentbased intrusion detection system aha 
ids provides detection adaptation adjusting amount system resources devoted task detecting intrusive activities 
accomplished dynamically invoking new combinations lower level detection agents response changing circumstances adjusting confidence associated lower level agents 
adaptive agentbased intrusion response system provides response adaptation weighting responses successful past techniques successful 
system example security adaptation manager sam provide higher degree adaptation 
sam adapts protection posture current state system 
specifically sam determines system protected calm state uses configuration minimizes resource usage 
system attack panic state aggressive detection posture maintained

system intrusion detection inter component adaptive negotiation project supports adaptation providing protocol allow id components dynamically negotiate modify agreements id components 
set researchers implemented prototype system distributed assessment response system dare supports dynamic changes currently perceived threat defense posture individual systems network commercial security system vendor internet security systems 
iss claims leading provider adaptive network security solutions iss product provides wide array security services adapt services frequently conducted risk assessments 
iss intrusion detection product capable detecting wide array intrusive activities appears support limited adaptation detection capabilities operation
