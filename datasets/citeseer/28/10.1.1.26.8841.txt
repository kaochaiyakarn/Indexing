parameterization represents step forward making possible describe performance respect problem size 
ways bid generation techniques falls short realism concerning selection goods goods request bundle price er bundle bids combine xor ed set 
fundamentally approaches su er failing model bidders explicitly attempting represent economic situation non economic model 
assumption appears reasonable violated domains expected length bundle related goods contains 
example people buying computers tend long combinatorial bids requesting monitors printers people buying tend short bids 
price problems pricing schemes techniques 
pricing especially crucial prices chosen carefully hard distribution computationally easy 
sandholm prices drawn randomly number goods requested :10.1.1.172.7540
method clearly unreasonable computationally trivial price unrelated number goods bid note bid goods small subset bid exactly price expectation 
second better disadvantage average range parameterized variable 
boutilier prices bids distributed normally mean standard deviation giving rise problem case 
fujishima prices drawn 
fundamentally andersson note critical pricing problem arises schemes discussed 
number bids generated large short bid drawn frequently long bid 
highest priced bid bundle dominates bids bundle short bids competitive 
pointed extremely large numbers bids approximation optimal solution simply take best singleton bid 
solution problem guarantee bid placed bundle example approach taken sandholm :10.1.1.172.7540
