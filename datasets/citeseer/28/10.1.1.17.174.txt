kraft architecture knowledge fusion transformation alun preece kit hui department computing science university aberdeen aberdeen uk alex gray philippe marti department computer science university uk trevor bench dean jones department computer science university liverpool liverpool uk cui intelligent business systems research advanced communications research bt labs uk describes kraft architecture supports fusion knowledge multiple distributed heterogeneous sources 
architecture uses constraints common knowledge interchange format expressed common ontology 
knowledge held local sources common constraint language fused knowledge sources 
fused knowledge solve problem deliver information user 
problem solving kraft typically exploits pre existing constraint solvers 
kraft uses open flexible agent architecture knowledge sources knowledge fusing entities users represented independent kraft agents communicating messaging protocol 
section presents overview kraft architecture subsequent sections examine operations individual components architecture 
overview kraft architecture kraft system agent architecture knowledge processing components realised software agents 
agent architecture chosen kraft reasons agent architectures designed allow software processes communicate knowledge networks high level communication protocols constraints sub type knowledge seen important feature kraft 
agent architectures highly dynamic open allowing agents locate agents run time discover capabilities agents form cooperative alliances kraft concerned fusion knowledge available line sources features seen great value 
design kraft consistent emerging agent standards notably de facto kqml standard de fipa standard :10.1.1.125.3310
agents peers agent communicate agent 
agents registering identity network location advertisement knowledge processing capabilities specific type agent called facilitator essentially intelligent yellow pages service 
agent needs request service agent asks facilitator recommend agent appears provide service 
facilitator attempts match requested service advertised knowledge processing capabilities agents 
facilitators fully fledged knowledge processing entities establishing service request matches service advertisement requires reasoning declarative representations request advertisement 
kraft agents communicate messages nested protocol stack 
kraft messages implemented character strings transported suitable underlying protocol example corba iiop tcp sockets 
simple message protocol encapsulates message low level header information including timestamp network information 
body message consists nested protocols outer protocol agent communication language constraint command query language subset knowledge query manipulation language kqml :10.1.1.125.3310
nested message content expressed cif protocol constraint interchange format superset constraint language shown section 
syntactically kraft messages implemented prolog term structures 
example message shown 
outermost kraft msg structure contains context clause low level header information clause 
facilitation query action finding set resources comply satisfiability suitability criterion 
words action finding resource advertised capability matches requirements derived query 
satisfiability criterion depends search strategy adopted resolution query spectrum bounded exact match hand set approximate matches hand 
words satisfiability criterion tradeoff correctness completeness set solutions 
facilitation performatives stated section subset kqml :10.1.1.125.3310
main functionalities described previous section supported operations advertisement resource willing advertise capabilities registering facilitator sending message containing location resource sending message containing formal description capabilities see section 
replies issued messages error occured 
facilitation protocol encapsulating facilitation mechanism variants forwarding receiving query enclosed recommend message facilitator reply agent origin query singleton list matching advertisements including corresponding resource 
replied advertisement contained message
