jennifer widom department computer science stanford university stanford ca widom db stanford edu natural alternative lazy approach eager advance approach data integration 
eager approach 
information source may interest extracted advance translated ltered appropriate merged relevant information sources stored logically centralized repository 

materialized view maintenance techniques rely fact base data updates closely tied view maintenance machinery view modi cation occurs transaction updates 
warehousing environment generally case system maintaining view integrator loosely coupled systems handling base data information sources 
underlying information sources participate view maintenance simply report changes 
sources may provide locking capabilities certainly global transactions 
scenario certain anomalies arise attempting keep views consistent base data see algorithms considerably complicated conventional view maintenance algorithms :10.1.1.19.5246
data warehouse views may need refreshed modi cation set modi cations base data 
large batch updates base data may considered case cient view maintenance techniques may involve di erent algorithms conventional view maintenance 
data warehousing environment may necessary transform base data referred data integrated warehouse 
transformations include example aggregating summarizing data sampling data reduce size warehouse discarding correcting data suspected erroneous inserting de fault values eliminating duplicates inconsistencies
