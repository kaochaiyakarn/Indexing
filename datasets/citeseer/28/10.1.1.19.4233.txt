projective translations affine stereo calibration andreas horaud investigates homography transforms set points projective space undergoing rigid translation termed projective translation 
representation parameters proposed 
represent explicitly geometric entities constraining defining translation 
practical algebraic method extracting parameters developed 
allows affine calibration stereo rig characterizing motion composing projective translations 
practical effectiveness calibration evaluated synthetic real image data 
recovery structure motion essential problems machine vision 
difficulties increase uncalibrated cameras considered case metric information missing 
rigidity motions observed uncalibrated stereo camera imposes strong constraints transforms describing 
allow augmented representation structure motion 
precisely homography maps sets points reconstructed projective space initial final position algebraically similar conjugate displacement :10.1.1.2.3778
representation structure scaled euclidean possible 
similarity class projective translations analyzed intrinsic parameterization introduced 
practice estimates matrices deviate theoretical form due round errors measurement noise outliers caused mismatches 
overcome computational method proposed decomposes proposed form numerically stable robustly inputs number important practical applications
