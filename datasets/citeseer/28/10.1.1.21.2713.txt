feedbackbypass new approach interactive similarity query processing paolo deis cnr university bologna bologna italy deis unibo years methods proposed implementing interactive similarity queries multimedia databases 
common methods idea exploit user feedback order progressively adjust query parameters eventually converge optimal parameter setting 
methods share drawback forget user preferences multiple query sessions requiring feedback loop restarted new query default parameter values 
proceeding frustrating user point view constitutes significant waste system resources 
feedbackbypass new approach interactive similarity query processing 
complements role relevance feedback engines storing maintaining query parameters determined feedback loops time wavelet data structure simplex tree 
nature multimedia objects complicates user task choosing appropriate query suitable distance criterion retrieve database objects best match needs sk 
due limitation query interface objective difficulty user point view properly understand retrieval process works high dimensional spaces typically represent relevant features multimedia objects 
instance user image retrieval system hardly able predict effects modification single parameter distance function compare individual objects result query 
obviate unpleasant situation multimedia systems incorporate feedback mechanisms allow users provide evaluation relevance result objects 
analyzing relevance judgments system generate new refined query improve quality result experimental evidence confirms :10.1.1.35.7769
interactive retrieval process iterated times user satisfied results gives rise feedback loop default parameters query engine gradually adjusted fit user needs see 
relevance feedback recognized highly effective tool applicability suffers major problems 
depending query numerous iterations occur acceptable result convergence slow 

basis scores new query new distance function computed determine second round results 
termination 
certain number iterations loop ends final result result optimal query user mind optimal distance function retrieve relevant objects
