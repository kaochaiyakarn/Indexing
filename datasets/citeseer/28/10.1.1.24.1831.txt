steps accommodating variable position tracking accuracy mobile augmented reality system steven feiner position tracking accuracy location aware mobile system change dynamically function user location variables specific tracker technology 
especially problematic mobile augmented reality systems ideally require extremely precise position tracking user head may able achieve necessary level accuracy 
possible ignore variable positional accuracy augmented reality user interface confusing system example accuracy low virtual objects nominally registered real ones may far 
address problem describe early stages experimental mobile augmented reality system adapts user interface automatically accommodate changes tracking accuracy 
system employs different technologies tracking user position resulting wide variation positional accuracy indoor ultrasonic tracker outdoor real time kinematic gps system 
areas outside range introduce dead reckoning approach combines orientation tracker environmental knowledge expressed spatial maps accessibility graphs
