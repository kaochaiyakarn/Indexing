argued openness internet scenario suitable conceive internet multiplicity independent environments internet nodes administrative domain nodes design applications terms agents explicitly locate access resources environment 
tucson support approach application design multiplicity independent interaction spaces tuple centres role environment 
mobile agents access tuple centres name locally transparent way globally internet network aware fashion 
local interaction space agents access local resources environment agora meet agents coordinate activities 
technology viewpoint tucson developed java guaranteeing portability platforms 
architecture light weight core designed support different sorts middleware sockets java rmi corba proprietary solutions 
minimises impact hosting environments enables wide range hardware devices desktops pdas exploit infrastructure 
tucson model directly supports integration tween heterogeneous information sources 
tuple coordination model naturally supports uncoupled interactions generative communication communication data survive communication acts provides agent uncoupling space time viewpoints agents interact needing know space uncoupling independently existence time uncoupling :10.1.1.113.9679
key aspects peer peer interaction model participants possible go point point communication protocols supporting location independent disconnected workflow participation 
tucson tuple centres powerful coordination abstractions tuple spaces programmed react communication events defining coordination laws rule agent interactions
