decentralized replicated object protocols describe new replicated object protocol designed mobile weakly connected environments 
protocol differs previous protocols combining epidemic information propagation voting fixed object voting 
advantage epidemic protocols data movement requires pairwise communication 
need majority quorum available simultaneously connected single time 
protocols increase availability voting primary copy primary commit schemes 
object voting allows votes take place entirely decentralized fashion server having complete knowledge group membership
