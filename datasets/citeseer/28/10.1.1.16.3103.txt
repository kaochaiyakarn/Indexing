ability cheaply train text classifiers critical information retrieval content analysis natural language processing tasks involving data partly fully textual 
algorithm sequential sampling machine learning statistical classifiers developed tested newswire text categorization task 
method call uncertainty sampling reduced fold amount training data manually classified achieve level effectiveness 
text classification automated grouping textual partially textual entities 
text available economically labeled subset sample data chosen label 
random sampling usually effective 
texts class members atypical texts labeled random sample usually contain negative examples positive ones 
support training classifier distinguish positive negative examples 
relevance feedback kind sampling :10.1.1.92.3553
effect users asked label texts current classifier considers class members 
approach call relevance sampling reasonable strategy text retrieval context user interested seeing relevant texts effectiveness final classifier produced 
relevance feedback proposed finding examples unusual word senses
