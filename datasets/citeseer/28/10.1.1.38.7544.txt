case estimating change frequency data improve web crawlers web caches help data mining 
identify various scenarios different applications different requirements accuracy estimated frequency 
develop frequency estimators identified scenarios 
developing estimators analytically show precise effective estimators show estimators propose improve precision significantly 
explosive growth internet data sources available online 
improving web crawler web crawler program automatically visits web pages builds local snapshot index web pages 
order maintain snapshot index date crawler periodically revisits pages updates pages fresh images 
typical crawler usually revisits entire set pages periodically updates 
crawler estimate individual page changes may revisit pages changed high probability improve freshness local snapshot consuming bandwidth 
crawler may improve freshness orders magnitude certain cases adjust revisit frequency change frequency :10.1.1.40.4718
improving update policy data warehouse data warehouse maintains local snapshot called materialized view underlying data sources autonomous 
materialized view usually updated peak hours minimize impact underlying source data 
size data grows difficult update view limited time window 
estimate individual data item row table changes may selectively update items changed incorporate changes amount time 
assuming crawler knows web pages change shows crawler improve freshness significantly 
show crawler estimate change frequency pages implement refresh policy proposed 
companion submitted vldb experience track explain web crawler techniques develop 
compares various crawler design choices statistics collected half web pages proposes architecture employs estimation techniques develop 
researchers studied build scalable effective web caching system minimize access delay server load bandwidth usage :10.1.1.35.4261
touches consistency issue cached pages focus developing new protocol may reduce inconsistency 
contrast proposes mechanism improve page replacement policy existing architecture 
data warehousing context lot done efficiently maintain materialized views :10.1.1.106.6091:10.1.1.19.5246:10.1.1.41.1205
focused different issues minimizing size view reducing query response time
