describes peculiar behavior observed class cellular automata defined cellular automata open possible environment influence evolution 
example may consider techniques analogous ones structure measured evaluating complexity probabilistic automaton reconstructed data series representing ca evolution 
possibilities rely application techniques derived image analysis example may spatial correlation measures extending dca simulation framework study behavior network structures regular ones dca small world graphs boolean networks networks mobile nodes intend perform experiments evaluate behavior dca different perturbation regimes experiment complex dca dca large set states non uniform transition functions 
results promise potential implications area distributed computing
