hierarchical internet object cache peter danzig chuck computer science department university southern california discusses design performance hierarchical proxy cache designed internet information systems scale better 
design motivated earlier trace driven simulation study internet traffic 
believe conventional wisdom benefits hierarchical file caching merit costs warrants reconsideration internet environment 
cache implementation supports highly concurrent stream requests 
performance measurements show cache outperforms popular internet cache implementations order magnitude concurrent load 
measurements indicate hierarchy increase access latency
