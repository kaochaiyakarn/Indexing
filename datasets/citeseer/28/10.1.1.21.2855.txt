propose sequence object oriented data model addresses unified orthogonal way 
orthogonality allows capture interactions aspects annotations may attached level video structuration composition operators preserve annotations argument videos 
proposed model reuses concepts stemming temporal databases operators defined setting may query 
accordingly query language video databases proposed variant temporal extension odmg oql 
main components proposal formalized implemented top object oriented dbms 
guide browsing entry point building video abstracts mean retrieve context particular piece video 
strong similarity structuration video structuration time calendars 
accordingly propose video structuration model concept granularity 
concept extensively studied contexts temporal reasoning artificial intelligence temporal databases 
definition granularity adopt completely novel generalizes developed :10.1.1.18.6545
important note concept granularity merely model structuration levels absolute temporal metric system case contexts 
time structured regular granularities minutes hours granularities may express distances time points 
time lines granularities basic concept video data model consider time line 
level time line tl pair tl finite set time marks binary relation tl set defining total linear order 
set shots video may seen set disjoint intervals time marks covering time line video 
notice possible view set frames partitioning video time line partition composed single time mark 
advantage modeling notion frame seen structuration level video way shots scenes 
allows attach annotations shots scenes way attached frames detailed section 
general case finer relation granularities defining structuration levels video necessarily total order :10.1.1.18.6545

achieve requirement allow object database video annotation 
definition database schema database designer may impose type restrictions annotations model particular application 
context annotation may simple textual structure context may structured sets keywords arbitrarily complex structure object 
studied previous lm heterogeneous annotations may queried generalized path expressions cacs :10.1.1.48.8190

sequences share raw video data modeled called meta data video omitted discuss images sound samples appear video playing 
generally bulky part video effort compress share extremely important
