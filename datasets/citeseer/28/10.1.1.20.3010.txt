propose approach lies uniformly images rectangular regions relying fully segmented images 
image define partially overlapping fuzzy regions 
region image extract moments color distribution store index 
feature vectors index relatively insensitive small translations small rotations image extracted fuzzy regions 
retrieve images define function measures similarity color feature vectors
