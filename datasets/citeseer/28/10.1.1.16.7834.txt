rst section agent uml protocol diagrams 
presentation inspired protocol diagrams 
case needs repeat times protocol 
nested protocols continue conditions hold 
interleaved protocols correspond protocols called execution second protocol 
bauer give example auction participant requests information bank account 
proposed new features domain reliability electronic commerce supply chain management needs features agent uml :10.1.1.16.7961

broadcast protocol diagrams broadcast manager task contract net protocol announces task 
second example auctioneer informs agents auction begins proposes new item sell 
example agents looking services jini :10.1.1.16.7961
synchronization example synchronization agents protocol decide assumption true false assumption needs modi ed 
synchronization allows agents de ne meeting point interaction 
agents reach point agents want follow interaction 
synchronization represented arrow crossed vertical line see 
current bid max 
amount withdraw seller buyer fig 

triggering actions protocol diagrams triggering actions applied supply chain management agent workers nish tasks time 
message sent dispatcher agent informing situation :10.1.1.16.7961
exception management opinion notion exception barely interaction protocols situation communication protocols 
cite article moore 
notion exception protocols important allows designers get rid abnormal situations coming improper protocols system performance slows 
notion exception refers behavior expected behavior

sending messages delivery protocol diagrams feature interesting consider domain ow 
acknowledgment correspond performance action associated message 
example protocol agent uml take example english auction protocol order exemplify protocol diagrams new features :10.1.1.16.7961
meaning english auction protocol agent auctioneer wants sell item informs agents just part interested auction participants new auction begins 
auctioneer informs auction participants item auction participants inform auctioneer accept bid 
auctioneer auction participants accept bid selects sent rst agreement informs wins round 
informs auction participants sent er bids rejected 
auctioneer closes auction compares current price item reserved price 
current price greater reserved price item won agent accepts bid 
auction participants informed auction closed 
protocol agent uml shown 
proposed protocol presents di erences ones proposed fipa bauer :10.1.1.16.7961
rst message sent agents network broadcast fipa approach bauer approach consider send set agents represented protocol 
situation repeated second message details item price 
deadline bidding arrow 
bauer propose insert deadline auctioneer auction participants inform start auction cfp initial price propose price cfp price price reserved price request price inform auction understood reject proposal price accept proposal price current time start delay fig
