data warehouse scenario integrating new data source data warehouse decision support database extracted set data sources 
data mart decision support database extracted data warehouse 
illustrate model management operations consider scenarios extending existing data warehouse adding new data source section new data mart section 
challenging scenarios commonly occur practice 
example want add authors new dimension data warehouse 
determining parts integrated obviously done automatically 
require userdefined specification additional mapping step fig 

merging resulting warehouse elements existing schema dw may require combining tables preliminary match step followed actual merge step :10.1.1.122.4181
observations obviously match compose key operations proposed solution achieve re existing mapping 
sql expression language requires operations support mapping objects set valued domains ranges 
combination provide default values allowed completely re existing mapping power abstraction level model management operations resulted short solution program huge productivity gain specification programming involved current warehouse tools 
especially remarkable generic operations tailored data warehousing 
merge dw dw map map map map map map map map map map map fig 

alternative sequence model management operations integrate new source parts warehouse schema matched directly rdb dw dw try re existing mapping map 
create copy map map step remove objects range map dw 
object map range dw part primary key remove range sql statement associated avoid deleting primary key attributes mapping produced steps merged existing tables steps :10.1.1.122.4181
deleting sql statement involves deleting create view deleting corresponding terms rdb select clause clause indicates needed define relevant restriction join condition 
deleted statement additional equivalence preserving simplifications statement may possible 
particular dw table completely dw sql statement eliminated result mapping map 
model management algebra needs structured way allows sql inferencing plug modifications sql statement 
problem input mapping directly dw map 
solution ensure resulting map includes elements domain map 
previous solution add default mappings elements domain map correspond element rdb map 
compose map map resulting map step 
mapping rdb dw computed far consists map map match merge steps :10.1.1.122.4181
map map populate different tables dw merge simple union 
table populate needed need preliminary match forming map 
tables common maps create view statements need combined 
may involve non trivial manipulation sql key columns 
map map populate different tables dw merge simple union 
table populate needed need preliminary match forming map 
tables common maps create view statements need combined 
may involve non trivial manipulation sql key columns 
steps solution may user defined mapping rdb elements add warehouse steps fig :10.1.1.122.4181

overlap previous maps mappings merged create view statements 
example step directly match dw tables products customers geography rdb tables book customer attribute relationships involved 
things avoids unwanted re applied rdb 
mappings referring different tables union step provides complete mapping rdb dw 
alternatively deriving sales table steps match attributes orderid customerid orderdate table book orders creating map step map remaining attributes steps 
step eliminate attributes create view select clauses sales statement map keep reduced query map time query 
leave orderid customerid attributes clause modified sales perform required joins 
obtain mapping statements sales map create view dw sales orderid customerid orderdate select orderid customerid orderdate rdb book orders map create view dw sales orderid productid quantity discount select orderid zipcode price rdb book orders rdb ordering rdb customer orderid orderid customerid customerid order orderid notice retain orderid sales match map map step drive merge step :10.1.1.122.4181
result corresponds sql statement right column row table 
observations approach applied similar steps solution particular match 
distinguishing feature partial reuse existing mapping applicable complete re 
new source matched warehouse source leading need merge mappings
