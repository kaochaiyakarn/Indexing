studies generally approaches collect data crawling traversing static web topology analyzing proxy server logs 
data collected crawler reflect dynamic rates accesses web resources 
data collected analyzing logs provide dynamic access information access times modification dates existing servers proxies provide log information best dynamically generated data typically include modification information
