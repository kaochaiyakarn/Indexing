time structured information world wide web 
wrapping web sites provide kind information provide second source information possibly date reliable facts 
give case study combining information kinds sources context learning facts companies 
provide results association rules propositional relational learning demonstrate data mining help improve extractors information kinds sources improves reliability data mined rules
