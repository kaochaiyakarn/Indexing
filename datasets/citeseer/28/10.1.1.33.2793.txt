reinforcement learning algorithm partially observable markov decision problems jaakkola mit edu singh singh mit edu michael jordan jordan mit edu department brain cognitive sciences massachusetts institute technology cambridge ma increasing attention paid reinforcement learning algorithms years partly due successes theoretical analysis behavior markov environments 
markov assumption removed generally algorithms analyses continue usable 
propose analyze new learning algorithm solve certain class non markov decision problems 
algorithm applies problems environment markov learner restricted access state information 
algorithm involves monte carlo policy evaluation combined policy improvement method similar markov decision problems guaranteed converge local maximum 
algorithm operates space stochastic policies space yield policy performs considerably better deterministic policy
