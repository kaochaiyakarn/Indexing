control driven coordination model manifold agents typically open external world interact events occurring defined input output ports 
observable behaviour point view coordination media state changes events occurring ports 
coordination laws establish events state changes occur propagate 
coordination media handle topology interaction space agents paying attention data possibly exchanged processes 
data driven coordination models linda interact external world exchanging data structures coordination media basically act shared data spaces :10.1.1.113.9679
