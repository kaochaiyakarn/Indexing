local scheduler gpgp agent contains local scheduler takes types input information produces set schedules alternatives 
input current subjectively believed task structure 
information potential duration potential quality interrelationships local scheduler chooses orders executable methods attempt maximize pre defined utility measure task group utility function sum task group qualities denotes quality time defined :10.1.1.42.8231
note quality accrue task group deadline 
second input set commitments commitments produced gpgp coordination mechanisms act extra constraints schedules produced local scheduler 
example method executable agent method executable agent methods redundant agent coordination mechanism may commit agent method 
commitments social directed particular agents sense shoham castelfranchi 
schedules equivalent shorter chosen length chosen random 
schedule chosen violated empty commitment violated replaced alternative alt 
commitment agents agents informed change commitment 
potentially cause cascading changes schedules multiple agents generally reasons mentioned previous paragraph important commitments broken secondly local schedulers solve problems multiple ways tends fluctuations third agents time cognizant resource bounded reasoners interleave execution scheduling agents spend day arguing scheduling details meet deadlines

current implementation predecessor facilitates relationship triggers commitments agents hinders relationships 
positive relationship facilitates oe oe indicates executing decreases duration power factor related oe increases maximum quality possible power factor related oe see details :10.1.1.42.8231
situation specific version coordination mechanism ignore relationships low power 
relationship hinders oe oe negative indicates increase duration decrease maximum possible quality 
coordination mechanism designed hinders similar negative relationships added family 
pro active existing mechanisms hinders mechanism successors relationship try schedule late commit earliest start time successor 
total final quality number deadlines missed better simply refers episode algorithm question greater total final quality missed fewer deadlines respectively
