algorithms temporal query operators xml databases rv ag department computer information science norwegian university science technology trondheim norway idi ntnu previous introduced new query operators needed order support xml query language supports temporal operations 
query operators possible query historical versions retrieve documents valid certain time query changes documents describe algorithms execution query operators discuss document content indexing efficient execution operators 
keywords xml temporal databases query processing query execution queries xml data performed directly database storing xml data example object relational database system xml data warehouse created xml data collected web example xyleme 
contents xml database xml data warehouse seldom static 
new documents created documents deleted important documents updated 
cases want able search historical old versions retrieve documents valid certain time query changes documents order realize efficient temporal xml database system issues solved including efficient storage versioned xml documents efficient indexing temporal xml documents temporal xml query processing
