adaptive agent architecture achieving fault tolerance persistent broker teams kumar oregon graduate institute brokered multi agent systems incapacitated rendered non functional brokers inaccessible due failures occur distributed software system 
propose theory teamwork specify robust brokered architectures recover broker failures adaptive agent architecture aaa show feasibility approach 
previous teamwork theory joint intentions assumes team members remain team long team exists 
extend theory allow dynamic broker teams members change time 
introduce theory maintenance goals enables brokers aaa broker team start new brokers recruit broker team 
result multi agent system maintain specified number functional brokers system despite broker failures effectively self system 
argued techniques meant specific failure situations require special infrastructural support 
example techniques hot backups object group replication virtual synchrony version voting need specific mechanisms communication synchronization replicas 
may possible techniques multi agent systems extensive modifications underlying agent infrastructure
