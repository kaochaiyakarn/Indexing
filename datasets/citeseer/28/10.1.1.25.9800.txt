program understanding tools affect programmers understand programs 
yz wong ller school computing science department computer science simon fraser university university victoria bc canada victoria bc canada explore question program understanding tools enhance change way programmers understand programs 
strategies programmers comprehend programs vary widely 
program understanding tools enhance ease programmer preferred strategies impose fixed strategy may suitable 
observations user study compares tools browsing program source code exploring software structures 
study participants tools solve high level program understanding tasks 
nested graph composite nodes contain nodes forming hierarchical structure navigated 
composite nodes typically represent software subsystems opened show children double clicking 
nested graph composite arc represents arcs lower level nodes hierarchy 
composite arc opened double clicking show constituent arcs may composite 
shrimp technique integrates fisheye view pan zoom approaches nodes interest graph :10.1.1.167.1350
fisheye view simultaneously displays context detail objects interest magnified relevant objects 
pan zoom approach allows user pan zoom view distortion critical information edge view 
tasks may need contextual cues programmer focuses fragment program code
