show certain conjunctive query language complex objects query containment weak query equivalence decidable 
results consequences 
answers queries guaranteed contain empty sets weak equivalence coincides equivalence result answers partially open problem equivalence nest unnest queries complex objects 
second derive np complete algorithm checking equivalence certain conjunctive queries grouping aggregates 
results rely translation containment equivalence conditions complex objects novel conditions conjunctive queries call simulation strong simulation 
generalizing ideas part 
believe opens number possible research 
interesting extend simulation strong simulation results queries unions involving order 
note solving strong simulation union allow strengthen theorem testing weak equivalence testing equivalence checking simulation queries order hard problem
