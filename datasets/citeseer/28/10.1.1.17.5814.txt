edu grid environment facilitates collaborative allows users query process data geographically dispersed data repositories 
past years growing interest developing applications interactively analyze datasets potentially collaborative setting 
describe active proxy service able cache query results results answering new incoming queries generate subqueries parts query produced cache submit subqueries final processing application servers store raw datasets 
experimental evaluation illustrate effects various design show benefits real applications gain middleware
