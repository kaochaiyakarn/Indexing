tsimmis project integration heterogeneous information sources sudarshan chawathe hector garcia molina joachim hammer kelly ireland yannis papakonstantinou je rey ullman jennifer widom goal tsimmis project develop tools facilitate rapid integration heterogeneous information sources may include structured unstructured data 
gives overview project describing components extract properties unstructured objects translate information common object model combine information sources allow browsing information manage constraints heterogeneous sites 
tsimmis joint project stanford ibm almaden research center 
overview common problem facing organizations today multiple disparate information sources repositories including databases object stores knowledge bases le systems digital libraries information retrieval systems electronic mail systems 
decision makers need information multiple sources unable get fuse required information timely fashion due di culties accessing di erent systems due fact information obtained inconsistent

translators mediators take input oem ql queries return oem objects 
users mediators obtain information translators mediators 
approach allows new sources useful soon translator supplied allows mediators access new sources transparently allows mediators stacked performing processing re nement relevant information 
users top access information writing applications request oem objects generic browsing tools developed 
browsing tool provides access mosaic world wide web viewers :10.1.1.38.2203
user writes query interactive worldwide web page selects query menu 
answer received hypertext document 
root document shows levels answer object hypertext links available take user portions answer appear root document 
tool provides mechanism exploring heterogeneous information sources easy interact commonly interface 
example wish model employee class subclasses active retired add subobject employee object label subclass value active retired
