architecture intrusion detection autonomous agents jai jose garcia fernandez david eugene spa ord diego coast laboratory purdue university west lafayette cs purdue edu coast technical report june intrusion detection system architectures commonly commercial research systems number problems limit con scalability eciency 
common shortcoming existing architectures built single monolithic entity data collection processing 
review architecture distributed intrusion detection system multiple independent entities working collectively 
call entities autonomous agents 
approach solves problems previously mentioned 
motivation description approach partial results obtained early prototype discussion design implementation issues directions 
issue need addressed monitor transceiver agent levels user interfaces 
detection intrusions monitor level delayed necessary information gets agents transceivers 
problem common distributed idss 
implementations developed prototypes aafid architecture currently process improving implementations developing new ones 
prototype rst prototype built programmed combination perl tcl tk intended proof concept architecture :10.1.1.38.1298
implementation call aafid behavior components extremely con gurable 
udp inter host communication mechanism solaris message queues intra host communication mechanism 
agents developed prototype detect di erent types interesting activity 
prototype allowed show aafid architecture doing distributed detection anomalous events
