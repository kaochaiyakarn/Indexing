selection predicate indexing active databases interval skip lists eric hanson johnson computer information sciences department university florida gainesville fl cis ufl edu tr april revised october new efficient selection predicate indexing scheme active database systems introduced 
selection predicate index proposed uses interval index attribute relation object collection rule condition clauses defined attribute 
selection predicate index uses new type interval index called interval skip list list 
list designed allow efficient retrieval intervals overlap point allowing dynamic insertion deletion intervals 
list algorithms described detail 
list allows efficient line searches insertions deletions simpler implement comparable interval index data structures priority search tree balanced interval binary search tree tree 
list interval index structure implementation active database predicate index 
efficient testing rule predicates critical performance active database systems forward chaining rule systems 
presents investigation important part rule condition testing problem active database systems inference engines face testing collection predicates see predicates match single data object 
database terminology problem testing object tuple see members collection single relation selection conditions match

efficient ways determine selection predicates match new modified tuple important match done regardless join clauses rule conditions tested 
predicate testing problem database rule system defined follows
