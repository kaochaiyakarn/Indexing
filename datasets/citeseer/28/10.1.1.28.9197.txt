state machines provide adequate means 
furthermore easily possible obtain implementation agent automatically specification 
desirable able check multiagent system satisfies interesting properties 
formalism allow verification formal analysis multiagent systems model checking 
framework introduced allows express declarative aspects multiagent systems means classical propositional logic procedural aspects systems means state machines statecharts
