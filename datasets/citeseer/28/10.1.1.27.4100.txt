prolog represent agent knowledge domain formulate agent reasoning tasks 
outline tasks reduced answering questions properties simple logic programs demonstrate methodology constructing programs 
efficient systems implementing general reasoning algorithms developed logic programming community 
show systems implement specific planning explanation finding plan checking algorithms simple act style agent architecture 
approaches logic basis agent design 
differ primarily languages logics agent knowledge specified algorithms agent perform reasoning tasks agent architecture 
instance toronto school cognitive robotics levesque uses modified substantially expanded versions situation calculus mccarthy hayes specify agent knowledge :10.1.1.85.5082
despite occasional nonmonotonic entailment primarily form circumscription mccarthy toronto school prefer stay close possible entailment relation reasoning algorithms classical logic 
approach agent behavior determined program written programming language golog levesque variants 
program allows procedural constructs sequences loops conditionals non deterministic operators test conditions non determinism resolved interpreter plan executable 
interpret execute constructs agent uses situation calculus entailment relation described 
due size diagram problem finding concise specification far trivial 
solution requires understanding nature causal effects actions presence complex interrelations fluents 
additional level complexity added fact standard mathematical reasoning causal reasoning nonmonotonic new information domain cause reasoning agent withdraw previously 
nonmonotonicity partly caused need representing defaults statements form normally objects type property 
default causal reasoning called inertia axiom mccarthy hayes :10.1.1.85.5082
