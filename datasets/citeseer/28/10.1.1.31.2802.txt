path planning expansive configuration spaces david hsu jean claude latombe rajeev motwani department computer science stanford university stanford ca latombe cs stanford edu introduce notion characterize family robot configuration spaces connectivity effectively captured roadmap randomly sampled milestones 
analysis expansive configuration spaces inspired develop new randomized planning algorithm 
algorithm tries sample portion configuration space relevant current query avoiding cost roadmap entire configuration space

path planning important problem robotics 
randomized path planner rpp searches path negated gradient artificial potential field constructed configuration space local minima potential function random walks 
practice results cases rpp behaves poorly 
usually happens robot trapped local minimum way escape go narrow passage 
probability random walk goes narrow passage extremely small

different techniques constructing roadmaps including uniform sampling followed enhancement difficult regions random reflections space obstacles sampling contact surfaces configuration space :10.1.1.19.3462
randomized planners demonstrated performance empirically complete 
achieve weaker notion probabilistic completeness find path high probability exists 
note path exists planner may terminate 
attempts provide theoretical justification observed success planners 
reduces time spent call clearance 
hand distance computation takes longer execute provides information reduce number calls clearance 
experience indicates second approach works better

currently roadmap planner generates milestones sampling uniformly random configuration space 
typically configurations picked collision obstacles discarded 
highly desirable sample collision free configurations efficiently 
idea pick uniformly small number configurations new planner expand configurations order generate additional milestones
