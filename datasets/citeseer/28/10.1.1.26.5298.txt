computational completeness programs built basic operations node edge addition node edge deletion abstraction method construction 
subsection briefly discuss computational power language 
restrict language node edge additions deletions obtain language relationally complete known sense proposed codd 
concretely suppose represent relation attributes domains class functional edges labeled printable classes tuples represented objects class 
simulation relations tuples classes objects invite reader convince relation computable relational algebra computable restricted language see :10.1.1.26.5298
adding abstraction simulate nested relational algebra 
nested relations represented analogous manner standard relations multivalued edges 
abstraction operation needed case obtain faithful simulations relation valued attributes meaning duplicate relations eliminated see
