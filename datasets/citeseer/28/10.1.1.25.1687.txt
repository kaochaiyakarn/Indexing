basically approaches designing data integration system 
global view approach de nes concepts global schema views sources local approach characterizes sources views global schema 
goal verify transform data integration system built local view approach system global view approach 
study problem setting global schema expressed relational model inclusion dependencies queries integration systems queries global schema views mapping expressed language conjunctive queries 
result transformation exists transform local view system global view system query set answers query wrt set answers wrt 
issue concerned important problems design data integration system method computing answer queries 
basic assumption regarding query processing queries posed system expressed terms global schema system able re express query terms suitable set queries posed sources 
reformulation process crucial step deciding decompose query global schema set subqueries sources meaning mapping 
computed subqueries shipped sources results assembled nal answer 
comparison local view global view approaches reported :10.1.1.127.3070
known approach ensures easier extensibility integration system provides appropriate setting maintenance 
example adding new source system requires provide de nition source necessarily involve changes global view 
contrary global view approach adding new source may principle require changing de nition concepts global schema 
known processing queries local view approach dicult task
