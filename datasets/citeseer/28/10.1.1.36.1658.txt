imagine master agent spawning number slave mobile agents subsequently injected network perform cooperative computation find piece information 
point master agent may want actively terminate computation slave agents requested information desirable terminate agent order prevent unnecessary resource consumption 
may want change parameter governing behavior agents response change context determined creation 
currently available mobile agent systems employ variety communication strategies
