ubiquitous web information agents gerd bernd thomas christian wolff uni koblenz de institute computer science universitat koblenz 
gives brief overview ai methods techniques developed building ubiquitous web information systems 
methods areas machine learning logic programming knowledge representation multi agent systems discussed context prototypical information system mia 
mia web information system mobile users equipped pda palm pilot cellular phone gps device cellular wap phone 
captures main issues ubiquitous computing location awareness anytime information access pda technology 
nowadays biggest chaotic unstructured source information world wide web 
positive examples contain addresses get recognition rate 
words give representation web page chosen selecting words words appearing web pages training set contain information words allow best distinguish pages contain address pages contain addresses 
machine learning information extraction extract information web pages necessary understand document involve semantic text techniques find relevant information recognizing underlying syntactical representation 
linguistically motivated attempts containing semantical syntactical parsing fail web documents html documents sense special text formatting annotating strings tags documents recognize extract relevant information 
syntax approach automatically learning extraction procedures wrappers described :10.1.1.32.6513:10.1.1.17.4992
similar approaches machine learning techniques automatic wrapper construction described 
extract information assume special text parts delimiters marking relevant information extracted 
key idea learning algorithm set example extractions web page addresses set addresses listed page collect surrounding text parts anchors component example address name street 
learn general pattern anchors
