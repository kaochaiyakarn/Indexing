cooperative distributed problem solving cdps studies loosely coupled network problem solvers solve problems individual capabilities 
problem solving node network capable sophisticated problem solving independently problems faced nodes completed cooperation 
cooperation necessary single node sufficient expertise resources information solve problem different nodes expertise solving different parts problem 
example problem design house node expertise strength structural materials space requirements different types rooms electrical wiring 
systems exchanged high level intermediate results consisting phrase hypotheses converge complete interpretations despite loss messages 
fa approach subsequently studied context distributed interpretation task vehicle monitoring see section local data received nodes sensors limited scope potentially 
research progressed clear exchange tentative partial results naive implementation fa quickly presence large amounts information

open systems building fa approach previous scientific community metaphor hewitt elaborated concept open systems :10.1.1.18.3624
open systems approach hewitt referred organizational knowledge processing emphasizes need agents cope conflicting inconsistent partial information integral part operation highly reliable operation system continuous

assumption requires cooperative strategies similar needed deal heterogeneous expert systems individual systems may different problem solving strategies knowledge representations different criteria judging acceptability solutions 
open systems approach currently concept implementation represent important conceptual framework structuring large complex cdps networks heterogeneous agents passively tolerate actively address inconsistencies 
summary functionally accurate cooperation suggests exchange tentative partial results allow nodes eventually converge correct consistent larger results 
communication generally reduce inconsistency nodes common information 
extension systems able model reason concurrent activities multiple agents discussed section 
second extension agents perform situations incomplete knowledge limited computational resources 
cases lead possibility generating incorrect inferences turn may result agents having inconsistent beliefs world 
result agents converge shared coordinated plans 
hewitt studies open systems section addresses problem argues formal logic inadequate :10.1.1.18.3624
