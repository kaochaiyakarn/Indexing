section remove rst assumption 
third assumption due action theories formulating correctness control modules 
rst glance restrictive reiter rei shows actions take essentially modeled instantaneous start actions 
viability fourth assumption depends third assumption known appropriate granularity parallelism modeled concurrency 
fth assumption re ects fact control modules may universal plans sch may rules states :10.1.1.49.6261
consequences formalize correctness control modules 
examples control modules consider mobile robot navigating ce oor 
assuming robot sensing mechanism tell robot located terms rooms elevator control module executed take robot elevator ce oor 
module goto elevator elevator go clockwise room elevator halt control module assumed robot action executed takes robot room clockwise direction

correctness universal plan sch :10.1.1.49.6261
means control module behave correctly executed certain important critical plausible set states simple characterization absence exogenous actions goal achieve uent formula quite straight forward intuitively described follows say module behaves correctly respect particular state executed successfully terminates state true 
behaves correctly respect behaves correctly respect states set need take account exogenous actions main component dynamic environment 
propose account different manner done exogenous actions combined agents actions resulting non deterministic probabilistic ects actions 
approach notion correctness control module respect achieving goal particular state described previous paragraph assumes interference exogenous actions 
table basic actions sa notion correctness control modules consider exogenous actions sensing actions 
goal extend approach control modules de ning correctness presence sensing actions developing methods automatically construct control modules

particular compare earlier research universal plans situation control rules robot execution languages agent theories architectures 
universal plans situation control rules control modules formulated similarities universal plans sch triangle tables nil sense set situations specify robot situation :10.1.1.49.6261
key di erence universal plans sch sch sch sch prescribe actions need executed possible situation 
contrast control modules consider closure set initial states 
consider initial set states set states robot initially action theory exogenous actions encode exogenous actions may occur closure set states robot 
set states fairly small compared set possible states 
particular ginsberg argues interesting universal plans take large amount space 
jonsson jb formally show plans run polynomial time polynomial size satisfy condition problem solution universal plan nd solution nite number steps
