path planning lazy prm robert department mathematics chalmers university technology se sweden kavraki department computer science rice university houston tx usa describes new approach probabilistic roadmap planners prms 
theme algorithm called lazy prm minimize number collision checks performed planning minimize running time planner 
algorithm builds roadmap configuration space nodes user defined initial goal configurations number randomly generated nodes 
neighboring nodes connected edges representing paths nodes
