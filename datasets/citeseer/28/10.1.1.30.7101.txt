constraint databases proposed powerful framework model retrieve spatial data 
constraint database spatial object represented quantifier free conjunction usually linear constraints called generalized tuple 
set solutions quantifier free formula represents set points belonging extension object 
relational algebra easily extended deal generalized relations 
algebra limitations modeling spatial data 
particular extend model algebra directly deal set points represented generalized tuple spatial object retaining time ability expressing computations expressed constraint database languages 
discuss external functions proposed algebra order cover functionalities expressed chosen logical theory 
propose update language spatial constraint databases principles algebra 
years area spatial databases attracted interest different application contexts geographical information systems gis vlsi design geometric modeling mechanical building design cad 
issues related development models able represent spatial data suitable different environments addressed :10.1.1.52.4815
proposed models general allowing representation spatial domains fixed dimensions 
constraint databases proposed general framework manipulating spatial data 
constraint database uses constraints specific decidable logical theory model retrieve data 
data level constraints able finitely represent possibly infinite sets relational tuples
