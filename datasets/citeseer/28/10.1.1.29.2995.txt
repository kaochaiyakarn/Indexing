organisational rules 
organisational abstractions organisational role models precisely describe roles constitute computational organisation terms functionalities activities responsibilities terms interaction protocols patterns 
role models establish position role organisation :10.1.1.53.3254:10.1.1.10.2242:10.1.1.41.4369
