representing querying xml incomplete information serge abiteboul inria rocquencourt serge abiteboul inria fr study representation querying xml incomplete information 
consider simple model xml data dtds simple query language representation system incomplete information spirit representations systems developed imielinski lipski relational databases 
scenario consider incomplete information xml document continuously enriched successive queries document 
show representation system represent partial information source document acquired successive queries intelligently answer new queries 
consider impact complexity enriching representation system query language additional features 
results suggest approach achieves practically appealing balance expressiveness tractability 
model limitations 
discuss impact various extensions model show minor extensions lead signi cant di culties 
representation system may longer exhibit user friendly way partial information available may longer strong representation system 
seriously various decision problems query answered information currently available high complexity undecidable 
extensions concern query language extra features include optional negative subtrees query patterns constructed answers recursive path expressions data joins powerful restructuring modeled pebble transducers :10.1.1.103.6191
