previous wrapper generation academic research commercial products primarily focused ability rapidly create wrappers :10.1.1.42.3821
previous attempt ensure accuracy wrappers entire set pages site provides capability detect failures repair wrappers underlying sources change 
developed technology rapidly building wrappers accurately reliably extracting data semistructured sources 
graphically illustrates entire lifecycle wrapper 
shown copyright ieee 
example assume addresses mile location appear bold see ones displayed italic 
extract names disjunctive start rule address address disjunctive rules ordered lists individual disjuncts decision lists 
applying disjunctive rule straightforward process wrapper successively applies disjunct list finds matches 
simplified examples nondisjunctive rule address real world sources wrapped disjuncts 
developed stalker hierarchical wrapper induction algorithm learns extraction rules examples labeled user :10.1.1.40.4602
graphical user interface allows user mark pages site system generates set extraction rules accurately extract required information 
approach uses greedy covering inductive learning algorithm incrementally builds extraction rules examples 
contrast approaches key feature stalker able efficiently generate extraction rules small number examples rarely requires examples cases examples sufficient 
ability generalize small number examples fold explanation 
second stalker exploits hierarchical structure source constrain learning problem 
precisely schema data extracted automatically decompose difficult problem extract items interest series simpler ones 
instance complex rule extracts restaurant names addresses phone numbers page take hierarchical approach 
apply rule extracts list restaurants rule break list tuples correspond individual restaurants tuple extract name address phone number corresponding restaurant 
hierarchical approach advantage able extract data pages contain complicated formatting layouts lists embedded lists previous approaches handle see details :10.1.1.40.4602
stalker sequential covering algorithm training examples tries learn minimal number perfect disjuncts cover examples 
definition perfect disjunct rule covers training example example rule matches produces correct result 
stalker creates initial set candidate rules repeatedly applies steps generates perfect disjunct select promising candidate refine candidate add resulting refinements stalker obtains perfect disjunct removes examples correct process repeated training examples 
stalker uses types refinements landmark refinements topology refinements 
better generalization potential stalker selects refinements 
refining stalker creates new candidates shown 
obtained landmark refinements token added landmark rules created topology refinements new landmark added 
works correctly examples stalker stops learning process returns 
punctuation address stalker able successfully wrap information sources wrapped existing approaches see details :10.1.1.40.4602
empirical evaluation sources proposed stalker learn extraction rules 
learned perfect rules accurate rules accuracy 
words learned rules accurate identifying highly informative examples stalker significantly better hard tasks ones failed learn perfect rules examples system provided carefully selected examples 
specifically informative examples illustrate exceptional cases
