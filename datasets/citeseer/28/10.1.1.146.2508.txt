sr tree index structure high dimensional nearest neighbor queries research development department national center science information systems rd ac jp shin satoh research development department national center science information systems satoh rd ac jp similarity queries feature vectors widely perform content retrieval images 
apply technique large databases required develop multidimensional index structures supporting nearest neighbor queries ciently 
ss tree proposed purpose known outperform index structures tree tree 
important features employs bounding spheres bounding rectangles shape regions 
demonstrate bounding spheres occupy larger volume bounding rectangles high dimensional data reduces search ciency 
overcome drawback propose new index structure called sr tree sphere rectangle tree integrates bounding spheres bounding rectangles
