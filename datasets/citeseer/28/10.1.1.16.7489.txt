state art speech recognition systems require transcribed utterances training transcription labor intensive time consuming process 
active learning aims reducing number training examples labeled inspecting unlabeled examples intelligently selecting informative ones respect cost function human label :10.1.1.119.2797
goal learning algorithm select examples labeling largest improvement performance 
describe new method reducing transcription effort training asr selectively sampling subset data 
purpose automatically label word utterance confidence score exploiting lattice output speech recognizer initially trained small set transcribed data 
compute utterance confidence scores word confidence scores selectively sample utterances transcribed scores

previous active learning concentrated approaches certainty methods methods 
certainty methods initial system trained small set annotated examples :10.1.1.52.2415
system examines labels unannotated examples determines predictions 
examples lowest annotation 
methods distinct set classifiers created small set annotated examples 
unannotated instances annotations differ different classifiers annotation 
selective sampling confidence measures achieve word accuracy results data 
empirically shown possible detect utterances little new information added initial set utterances
