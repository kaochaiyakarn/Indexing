thesis proposal addresses small part problem detection anomalies system operation system 
response challenge immune systems distinguish self recognise foreign pattern due virus different associated organism pattern previously encountered 
aim apply requirement artificial system may form deliberate intrusion random anomalous behaviour due fault 
designing reflective architectures self diagnostic systems simpler rely single coordination mechanism system intended 
coordination mechanism inspected repaired system means gap reflective coverage 
secondly entities micro level architecture may called non autonomous agents parts 
convention term agent micro level entities sense participants society macro level system called autonomous system 
relationship cognitive architectures macro level requirement self distinction confused self reflection constrained issues limited capacity complex psychological understanding self relevant problem
