logic programming framework component software prototyping maurizio martelli mascardi zini universit di genova genova italy mascardi disi unige presents caselp logic prototyping environment specifying verifying complex distributed applications 
caselp provides set languages modeling intelligent interacting components agents different levels abstraction 
tools integrating legacy software prototype 
possibility integrating executable prototype agents specified developed components prove extremely useful engineering process complex applications 
fact reusability existing components verified application implemented developer confident correctness new components specification executed tested means interaction existing components 
aspects integration reuse caselp faces fundamental issue nowadays applications distribution
