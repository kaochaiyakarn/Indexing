theories aeb called autoepistemic belief theories 
belief theory shown static expansion computed iterating natural monotonic belief closure operator psi starting way static expansion belief theory provides natural non monotonic semantics called static semantics 
easy see belief theory finite construction static expansion stops countably iterations 
somewhat surprising result obtained shows static expansion finite belief theory fact obtained means single iteration belief closure operator psi requires special form show put form 
result eliminates need multiple iterations computation static semantics allows replace definition static semantics equivalent explicit straightforward definition psi
