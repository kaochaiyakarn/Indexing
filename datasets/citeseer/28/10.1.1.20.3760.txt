examines temporal difference methods training connectionist networks td algorithm successfully applied complex real world problems 
number important practical issues identified discussed general theoretical perspective practical issues examined context case study td applied learning game backgammon outcome self play apparently application algorithm complex nontrivial task zero knowledge built network able learn scratch play entire game fairly strong intermediate level performance clearly better conventional commercial programs fact surpasses comparable networks trained massive human expert data set indicates td learning may better practice expect current theory suggests analysis td methods applications complex domains may worth investigating 

fascinating challenging paradigms traditional machine learning research delayed reinforcement learning paradigm 
simplest form paradigm learning system passively observes temporal sequence input states eventually leads final reinforcement reward signal usually scalar
