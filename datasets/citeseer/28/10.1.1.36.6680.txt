mapping adome meta models wfms developing experimental wfms called adome wfms aims support functions features mentioned 
name suggests adome wfms built integrated advanced object oriented modeling environment adome 
particular adome system developed enhance knowledge level modeling capabilities oodbms models allow adequately deal data knowledge management requirements advanced information management applications wfmss :10.1.1.37.5925
adome serve effectively basic layer provide mentioned important features cf 
section necessary building comprehensive wfms viz adome wfms 
extending existing oodb inside wfms integrated approach shields wfms low level details provides rich set modeling features constructs building wfms 
approach facilitates testing maintenance evolution software engineering point view illustrates various meta models supported centered adome 
contrast currently wfmss having facilities supporting spectrum exception handling resolutions especially relating workflow evolution 
adome wfms user choose suggested resolutions persistent enter schema evolution operation update workflow enter new eca rules 
workflow evolution requires modification workflow definitions adding eca rules system progress advanced schema evolution capability required run time 
wfmss relational databases hardly support schema evolution severely restricts workflow evolution resolutions 
due adome support dynamic schema evolution readily provides exception resolutions schema evolution cf :10.1.1.37.5925
section 
noted resolutions schema evolution general purpose ones help reduce additional exceptions occur 
furthermore advanced eca rule support adome greatly facilities reuse exception handling rules flexibility associating rules different targets task sub activities psas events
