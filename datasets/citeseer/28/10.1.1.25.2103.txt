team synthetic software agents designed compete robocup simulation league arti cial multi agent world 
previous generations developed hierarchy logic agent architectures initially captured certain types situated behaviour basic classes complex tactical behaviour 
resulting architecture draws expressive power situated automata architectures retaining clarity logic representation 
third generation designed line framework 
particular focuses exploring emergent tactical teamwork 
classic example emergent hard coded behaviour behaviour implemented temporal production system tps 
tps res rule atomic commands sequence inserted queue timely execution inherited level 
addition tps monitors currently progressing actions providing explicit account temporal continuity actions duration allowing embed actions cations interactions 
example dribbling action suppressed shooting passing 
worth noting architecture viewed subsumption architecture :10.1.1.18.4669
allows easily express desired subsumption dependencies levels 
precisely possible con ict behaviour instantiations behaviour behaviour triggered sensory input resolved internal state inhibition lower level behaviour necessary 
instance chase suppressed teammate possession ball 
agent displays quite interesting instantiations behaviour dribble opponents speci ed location intercepting fast moving ball controlling turning ball resultant vector passing shooting goal non blocked path tactical agents behaviour functions situated agents described previous section uniformly de ned respective domains ranges
