problems occlusions imprecise localization faces ultimately imply failure identification little done account problem proposed account second 
presents probabilistic approach attempts solve problems eigenspace representation 
resolve localization problem need find subspace feature space eigenspace represents error training image 
resolve occlusion problem face divided local regions analyzed isolation 
contrast previous approaches simple voting space probabilistic method analyzes local match method proven superior local voting pca set face images 
global pca approach general unable correctly identify image large part occluded 
resolve divide face different local parts shown 
local parts modeled mentioned gaussian distribution 
easily compute global identity test image simply adding local probabilities defined gaussian distributions compute local probabilities mahalanobis distance 
approach differs previous local pca approaches probabilistic approach voting space :10.1.1.38.5998
advantage method local area face classified best option generally incorrect best choice small probability correct class probable choices 
approach tested images ar face database 
face images database appear different illumination conditions different facial expressions different occlusions wearing 
illustration images subject shown details section

number features detected image large complexity considered 
cases knowing accounting error feature time imply significant change appearance practice subset expected suffice 
local probabilistic approach way deal partially occluded objects faces local approaches :10.1.1.90.4868
