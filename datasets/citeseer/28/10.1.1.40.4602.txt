tremendous amount information available web daily basis ability quickly develop information agents crucial problem 
vital component web information agent set wrappers extract relevant data semistructured information sources 
novel approach wrapper induction idea hierarchical information extraction turns hard problem extracting data arbitrarily complex document series simpler extraction tasks 
introduce inductive algorithm stalker generates high accuracy extraction rules user labeled training examples 
labeling training data represents major bottleneck wrapper induction techniques experimental results show stalker requires orders magnitude fewer examples algorithms 
match correctly fail match stalker wildcards landmarks 
remaining candidates represents best solution longest landmark disjuncts token landmark 
consequently returns uncovered examples stalker completes execution returning disjunctive rule 

experimental results order evaluate stalker capabilities tested information sources application domains wien kushmerick wrapper induction system comparison systems fair possible domain specific wildcards tried follow exact experimental conditions kushmerick :10.1.1.33.2176
sources wien labeled examples exact data remaining sources worked closely kushmerick reproduce original wien extraction tasks 
furthermore wien experimental setup start randomly chosen training example learn extraction rule test unseen examples 
repeated steps times average number test examples correctly extracted 
remember perfect disjunct correctly matches example rejects ones 
final analysis say independently difficult induce extraction rules particular source list extraction iteration rules usually learned accuracy just examples 

efficiency issues order easily compare wien stalker requirements terms number training examples divided sources main groups sources perfectly wrapped systems table ii sources wrapped perfectly system tables iii iv sources wien fails completely stalker generates imperfect wrappers table 
source wien wrap see tables ii iv provide pieces information number training pages required wien generate correct wrapper total number item occurrences appear pages 
taken kushmerick represents smallest number completely labeled training pages required wrapper classes generated wien :10.1.1.33.2176
obtained multiplying number average number item occurrences page computed available documents 
source stalker wrapped perfectly report pieces informations minimum maximum mean median number training examples item occurrences required accuracy data different lists appear successive lines see instance source

increasing interest accessing web information sources significant number research projects depend wrappers retrieve relevant data 
wide variety languages developed manually writing wrappers extraction rules written human expert procedural languages atzeni mecca perl scripts cohen pattern matching chawathe ll grammars 
systems offer fairly expressive extraction languages manual wrapper generation tedious time consuming task requires high level expertise furthermore rules rewritten sources suffer format changes 
order help users cope difficulties ashish knoblock ashish knoblock proposed expert system approach uses fixed set heuristics type look bold italicized strings 
wrapper induction techniques introduced wien kushmerick better fit frequent format changes rely learning techniques generate extraction rules :10.1.1.33.2176
compared manual wrapper generation kushmerick approach advantage dramatically reducing time effort required wrap source extraction language significantly expressive ones provided manual approaches 
fact wien extraction language seen non disjunctive stalker rules just single skipto allow wildcards 
important differences stalker wien 
wien learns landmarks searching common prefixes character level needs training examples stalker
