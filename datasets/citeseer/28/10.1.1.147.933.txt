relative pronoun antecedents locating gap separate equally difficult problem gap may appear variety positions embedded clause subject direct object indirect object object preposition 
simple solution gap finding problem consistent see cardie lehnert 
relative pronouns referred wh words 
antecedent single noun phrase

apparent antecedent 

disambiguation relative pronoun may depend information embedded clause 
example antecedent man woman man depending number embedded clause verb 
antecedent truly ambiguous 
sentences real antecedent depends surrounding context 
locating antecedent requires assimilation syntactic semantic knowledge 
syntactic structure clause preceding sentences example identical np pp 
antecedent case different

addition approach duplicates performance handcoded rules

section describe current approaches relative pronoun disambiguation 
remainder presents automated approach compares performance handcoded rules 
finding wh phrase antecedents previous approaches natural language processing system hopes process real world texts requires reliable mechanism locating antecedents relative pronouns 
systems formal syntactic grammar directly encode information relative pronoun disambiguation grammar 
times grammar proposes set syntactically legal antecedents set passed semantic component determines antecedent inference preference rules 
examples approach see hobbs ingria stallard lappin mccord 
alternatively semantically driven systems employ disambiguation heuristics rely part semantic knowledge include syntactic constraints umass muc lehnert 
approach requires manual encoding relative pronoun disambiguation rules part formal grammar designed find relative pronoun antecedents possible syntactic contexts heuristics include syntactic semantic constraints 
surprisingly nlp system builders rule sets time consuming error prone 
furthermore resulting rule set fragile generalizes poorly new contexts 
example umass muc system began rules finding antecedents relative pronouns 
rules approximately instances relative pronouns occurred newswire stories muc corpus 
counterexamples identified new rules added approximately existing rules changed 
time increasingly reluctant modify rule set global effects local rule changes difficult measure 
addition rules class sentences umass muc system contain important information

steps discussed detail sections follow 
building case base create hierarchical memory relative pronoun disambiguation cases conceptual clustering system called cobweb fisher 
cobweb takes input set training instances described list attribute value pairs incrementally discovers classification hierarchy covers instances 
system tracks distribution individual values favors creation classes increase number values correctly predicted knowledge class membership 
details cobweb necessary understanding rest useful know nodes hierarchy represent probabilistic concepts increase generality approach root tree 
new instance classify training cobweb retrieves specific concept adequately describes instance 
provide cobweb set training cases represents disambiguation decision single occurrence relative pronoun 
describe decision terms classes attribute value pairs constituent attribute value pairs cd form attribute value pair part speech attribute value pair antecedent attribute value pair 
paragraphs briefly describe attribute type cases examples 
antecedent relative pronoun usually appears clause just preceding relative pronoun include constituent attribute value pair phrase clause 
attribute describes syntactic class phrase position respect relative pronoun 
example th court represented attribute pp prepositional phrase position left juan represented attributes np np respectively noun phrases positions left subject verb experiments described run version cobweb developed robert williams pace university 
initial efforts concentrated resolution hand coded heuristics relative pronoun complicated difficult modify 
expect resolution wh words fall difficulty 
note term constituent loosely refer noun phrases prepositional phrases verb phrases prior attachment decisions 
judge th court constituents human pp physical target nil cd form cd form physical target part speech part speech comma antecedent antecedent police juan constituents human np proper name cd form cd form proper name part speech part speech comma antecedent antecedent np cd form das constituents human np proper name nil cd form cd form proper name part speech part speech comma antecedent antecedent cd form cd form relative pronoun disambiguation cases constituents judge retain traditional labels positional information included attributes 
value associated constituent attribute simply semantic classification best describes phrase head noun 
set general semantic features categorize noun lexicon human proper name location entity physical target organization weapon 
subject constituents receive value human example head nouns marked human semantic feature lexicon 
verbs currently note presence absence verb values nil respectively 
addition case includes cd form part ofspeech antecedent attribute value pair 
cd form attribute value pair represents phrase recognized syntactic analyzer 
value semantic feature associated constituent 
example constituent recognized just th court phrase part case representation attribute value pair cd form addition participation constituent attribute value pair pp physical target

adjusted results discount errors automated approach involve antecedent combinations seen training cases 
situations semantic syntactic structure novel clause usually differs significantly hierarchy expect accurate retrieval case base 
experiment example errors fall category 
initial results conclude automated approach relative pronoun disambiguation clearly surpasses phrase baseline heuristic duplicates performance handcoded rules 
furthermore kind errors exhibited learned heuristics reasonable
