semi automatic image annotation liu susan dumais sun zhang mary czerwinski brent field microsoft research china road beijing pr china microsoft research microsoft way redmond wa microsoft com novel approach semi automatically progressively annotating images keywords 
progressive annotation process embedded course integrated keyword content image retrieval user feedback 
user submits keyword query provides relevance feedback search keywords automatically added images receive positive feedback facilitate keyword image retrieval 
coverage quality image annotation database system improved progressively cycle search feedback increases 
strategy semi automatic image annotation better manual annotation terms efficiency better automatic annotation terms accuracy 
performance study shows high annotation coverage achieved approach preliminary user study described showing users view annotations important image retrieval 
user study suggested user interface enhancements needed support relevance feedback 
believe similar approaches applied annotating managing forms multimedia objects 
keywords image annotation image retrieval relevance feedback image database user study performance evaluation labeling semantic content images generally multimedia objects set keywords problem known image multimedia annotation 
annotation primarily image database management especially image retrieval 
annotated images usually keyword search images extremely difficult find large databases 
image analysis techniques called contentbased image retrieval flickner accurate robust keyword image search preferable image annotation unavoidable 
addition qualitative research rodden reports desirable search capability managing personal digital photographs ability search text annotations 
currently image database systems employ manual annotation gong 
users enter descriptive keywords images loaded registered browsed 
manual annotation image content considered best case terms accuracy keywords selected human determination semantic content images labor intensive tedious process 
addition manual annotation may introduce retrieval errors due users forgetting descriptors annotating images lengthy period time 
researchers explored techniques improving process manual annotation 
shneiderman kang developed direct annotation method focuses labeling names people photos 
method user simply select name manually entered name list drag drop image annotated 
avoids typing manual method involves drag drop operations 
limitations related name list especially list potential long 
requires time effort annotate photographs manually improved interfaces users reluctant automatic image annotation techniques may desirable

relevance feedback allows relevant images shown top ranks provides user opportunity see confirm annotate iteration 
proposed approach annotations updated automatically relevance feedback provided shown scenario 
specifically user submit query consisting keywords system uses keyword automatically search database images relevant keyword 
situations consider point 
case images system annotated query keyword 
second case images annotated keyword match query 
user manually annotated images images registered system system progressively tagged images keyword iterative relevance feedback 
case system returns random list images keyword matched image semantically relevant query keyword 
surprisingly confusing user system discuss detail user interface designed address problem 
second case annotated images similar keyword specified query retrieved shown browser top ranking matches 
addition images added browsing list set images visual feature similarity images matched query discussed detail subsection set randomly selected images 
retrieved image list user may relevance feedback interface tell system images relevant irrelevant 
relevant images image annotated query keyword image annotated keyword initial weight 
image annotated weight keyword image increased increment 
irrelevant images weight keyword decreased fourth original weight
