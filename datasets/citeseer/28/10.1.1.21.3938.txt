build statistical foundations tackling navigation problem formal model web terms probabilistic automaton viewed finite ergodic markov chain 
model web probabilities attached state transitions interpretations denote proportion times user followed link alternatively denote expected utility link

empirical entropy navigation trail length mi log mi mi number states mi number times link ith page jth page followed mi number visits ith page 
markov chain assumption somewhat controversial justifiable attempt obtain analytic results aid understanding navigation problem 
empirical results pirolli pitkow pp web log data summarise user navigation sessions support initial choice order markov chain model opposed higher order markov chain model reasons 
firstly navigation sessions typically short tend exhibit long range dependencies 
context huberman suggested universal law surfing backed evidence web log data predicts typical trails short :10.1.1.163.4411
secondly experimental results pirolli pitkow pp suggest order markov chain model substantially stable period time higher order markov chain model reliable 
indicated subsection higher order markov chains reduced order markov chains aggregating states techniques ll extend higher order markov chain models 
fact extended basic technique higher order markov chains bounded order utilising dynamic markov modelling ch adaptive context modelling method finite state model built dynamically
