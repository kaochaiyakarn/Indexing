engineering mobile agent applications context dependent coordination giacomo cabri letizia leonardi franco zambonelli dipartimento di scienze dell universit di modena reggio emilia modena italy mail giacomo cabri letizia leonardi franco zambonelli unimo mobility introduces peculiar coordination problems agent internet applications 
suggests exploitation infrastructure multiplicity local interaction spaces 
second may require coordination activities adapted characteristics execution environment occur needs application coordinating agents belong 
introduces concept context dependent coordination programmable interaction spaces 
hand interaction spaces associated different execution environments may independently programmed lead differentiated environment dependent behaviors 
hand agents program interaction spaces visited execution environments obtain application dependent behavior interaction spaces 
hand decentralization management distribution scale necessary partial knowledge available target environment require application components integrate capacity dealing unexpected situations part intrinsic behavior terms exceptions 
hand intrinsic interactivity internet applications require application components interact variety possibly unknown advance entities services legacy applications components different applications 
kinds interactions assume complex forms difficult expressed terms traditional client server fashion leading organizational view distributed application compositional view 
reasons justify adoption agent oriented approach internet application development 
developing applications terms autonomous entities capable reacting changes environment executing proactive way naturally deal dynamicity unpredictability :10.1.1.101.5226
exploiting notion sociality typical agent oriented paradigm easily decompose application terms multi agent organization necessary interaction protocols find order accommodation definition 
agent mobility agents capability moving internet executing recognized useful property actual execution conceptual design internet applications 
actual movement software agent transfer code data state nodes resources needs access allocated provide saving network bandwidth increasing reliability efficiency execution 
virtual movement software agent refers fact agent internet applications suitable internet multiplicity execution environments internet nodes administrative domains design applications terms agents aware distributed nature target virtually move different execution environments access resources allocated 
interaction model address way problems related agent mobility explicitly identify environment dependent coordination issues full potential enforcing context dependent coordination systems non mobile agents interacting peer peer way 

progress introduced concept contextdependent coordination mobile agents shown concept effectively implemented exploiting notion programmable tuple spaces 
defining framework agent coordination may easily represented may tuned specific needs applications environments simplify application design management may represent important driving force successful deployment internet applications mobile agents 
issues addressed needs analyzed coordination infrastructures integrated agent communication languages agents interact terms high level knowledge information ii role models due importance analysis design multiagent applications better integrated model iii specific software engineering methodologies defined help developing agent applications devising exploit agent mobility context dependency :10.1.1.101.5226
