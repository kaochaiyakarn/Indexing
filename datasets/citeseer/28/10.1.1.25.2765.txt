designed implemented persistent deductive database system called relationlog 
persistent deductive system relationlog naturally supports inference large amounts data 
existing deductive database systems relationlog directly supports nested relational complex object models supports storage data complex structures 
addition provides powerful mechanisms efficient access deeply nested data 
relationlog system provides declarative query language relationlog declarative data manipulation language :10.1.1.40.2037
main novel features system follows domain types schemas facts rules persistent facts rules needed query evaluation dynamically selected results temporarily stored queries intensional data materialized opposed evaluated dynamically time queried lru mechanism remove intensional extensional data memory memory space needed various evaluation strategies automatically nature query data database user intervention need specifying query forms modes aditi ldl coral describe design implementation relationlog system

atomic data type supported relationlog includes string token integer float tuple set list bag types defined 
example define tuple set list bag types relationlog address street string city string string simple complex data types define relation schemas
