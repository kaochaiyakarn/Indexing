creating practical system network things think tried balance working deep agent research questions creating simple useful software everyday programmers 
hive draws techniques parts agent research including agent autonomy mobility multi agent interaction agent ontologies 
fields tried extract essential pieces bypassing complexities unsolved problems 
agent anatomy hive agents rooted common agent base class 
limitations java class hierarchies semantic description compounded fact agent want assume different capabilities runtime 
example agent filters event streams need assume different identities depending event source connected 
java add interfaces object runtime type object static 
circumvent limitations hive uses second orthogonal ontology describe semantic information agents 
ontology utilizes resource description framework rdf xml :10.1.1.44.6030:10.1.1.44.6030
rdf provides structured way attach nouns verbs agents 
example agent semantic description state physical location human readable nickname owner device description meaning data 
hive agents carry rdf description available calling
