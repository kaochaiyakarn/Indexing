active vision systems capability continuously interacting environment 
rapidly changing environment systems means attractive replace static representations visual routines compute information demand 
routines place premium image data structures easily computed 
eigenvectors form set orthogonal basis functions representing input 
input images eigenvectors input distribution required principle completely represent input image set due statistics natural images usually case small number eigenvectors

object representations form high dimensional feature vectors mel viola 
mel concerned exclusively object identification problem uses color conjoined edge curvature detectors 
argues multiple objects handled additional features propose problem resolved encompassing active vision system provides necessary ground segmentation 
viola focuses object identification uses index complex local features 
certainly cases segmentation may extremely crude issue assumes lesser significance light fact crude segmentation currently foveated object background suffice cases routines described 
example identifying currently foveated object circular template strategy approximate determination centroid required due tendency nearby points highly correlated 
exact determination object boundary essential feature vectors extracted points lying specified distance approximate object boundary 
current method relies ground segmentation stereo
