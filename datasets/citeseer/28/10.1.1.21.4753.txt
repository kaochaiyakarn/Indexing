discretization principle motivation discretizing numeric data twofold findings attribute value learning 
hand efficiency concern 
hand discretizing data may obtain higher accuracy rates 
current ilp systems generate numbers induction process may cause lot overhead refinement step lot constants need generated :10.1.1.34.5768
tilde numeric domains induction process efficient
