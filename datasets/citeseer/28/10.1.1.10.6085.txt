evaluating top selection queries surajit chaudhuri microsoft research microsoft com applications users specify target values certain attributes requiring exact matches values return 
result queries typically rank top tuples best match attribute values 
study advantages limitations processing top query translating single range query traditional relational dbmss process efficiently 
particular study determine range query evaluate top query exploiting statistics available relational dbms impact quality statistics retrieval efficiency resulting scheme 
internet search engines rank objects results selection queries objects match original selection condition 
engines query results flat sets objects match condition

intuitively property scoring functions implies tuple closer attribute sum euclidean scores axis query different pairs scoring functions sum euclidean 
query values tuple score gets query worse fortunately interesting scoring functions think satisfy monotonicity assumptions 
particular euclidean min sum scoring functions defined satisfy property
