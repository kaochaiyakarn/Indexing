estimating selectivity spatial queries correlation fractal dimension alberto dipartimento di informatica politecnico di milano milano italy mail christos faloutsos institute systems research isr dept computer science univ maryland college park mail christos cs umd edu february examine estimation selectivities range spatial join queries real spatial databases 
shown earlier fk real point sets violate consistently uniformity independence assumptions described fractals non integer fractal dimension 
show infinite family fractal dimensions called correlation dimension need predict selectivity spatial join 
main contribution real synthetic point sets tried average number neighbors point point set follows power law exponent 
immediately solves selectivity estimation spatial joins biased range queries queries centers prefer areas high point density 
formulas estimate selectivity biased queries including integration constant shape query shape
