view self maintenance refers maintaining materialized views accessing base data 
self maintenance particularly useful data warehousing settings base data comes sources may inaccessible 
studied nontemporal views important warehouse stores temporal views history source data source history needed perform view maintenance may longer exist 
tackles self maintenance problem temporal views 
show derive auxiliary data stored warehouse warehouse views auxiliary data maintained accessing sources 
shall address length update window affects amount auxiliary data needed self maintenance 
note example employee tuple indicating time may alive multiple disjoint time periods 
earlier sales department example order tuple alive time period 
source tuple alive set periods versus single period dramatic impact amount auxiliary data needed 
base true temporal data model temporal query language equivalent subset tsql :10.1.1.37.3552
emphasize results applicable existing warehouses operational sources ad hoc temporal support 
systems typically store temporal information normal attributes relational model query sql 
ad hoc temporal warehouse usually materializes entire history source data leaves administrator control purging unneeded historical data 
solving self maintenance problem provides way automatically identify remove warehouse data longer needed view maintenance
