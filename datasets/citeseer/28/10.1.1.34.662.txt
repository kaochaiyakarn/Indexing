decentralized incremental maintenance multi view data warehouses extended stanoi agrawal el abbadi department computer science university california santa barbara ca decision support systems big percentage data base servers 
presently size increases due necessity detailed information extended time range interest 
result data mining queries span larger sets data 
achieve fast response time subset relevant information materialized views separate database sources 
data warehouse example storage integrates information multiple sources may stand databases sites internet 
data warehousing powerful concept supporting analytical processing building data warehouse runs pragmatic problems 
result distribution multiple materialized views maintained different sites distributed large network 
expect views may depend base sources data generated may depend derived views 
may due data security restrictions requirements data flows organization sharing information companies 
hierarchical arrangement views provide possibility accessing data different granularity levels facilitate operations drill roll 
algorithms previously developed maintenance distributed data warehouse specifically designed single view independent multiple views :10.1.1.48.4672
develop efficient incremental algorithm maintenance multi views distributed data warehouse 
multiple view environment single view may derive information source data multiple paths intermediate views 
consistency views reflect state common data sources 
zhuge proposed synchronization processing unit ensuring consistency requiring additional delay view updates
