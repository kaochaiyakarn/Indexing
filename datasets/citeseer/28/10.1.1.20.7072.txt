propose preliminary methodology agent oriented software engineering idea agent interaction analysis 
approach uses interactions undetermined agents primary component analysis design 
agents basis software engineering useful provide powerful intuitive abstraction increase complex design 
describes process designer derive interactions occur system satisfying requirements design structure agent system including identification agents 
suggest approach flexibility necessary provide agent oriented designs open complex applications value maintenance extension systems 
agent complete goal need cooperate 
unfortunately request cooperation may rejected possible goal achieved 
address designer may want mandatory particular agents take particular goals agent doing 
extreme form assurance minimum standards guaranteed 
restriction comparable services methodologies note agents take goals required agents run time :10.1.1.10.2242
reason agents able possess deal multiple goals 
preferences appears vast amount analysis done system interactions interactions similar form suggest certain structure agents system 
example certain things assumed interaction restrict occurring designed system honest communication information goal requires may require low communication costs 
design agent interaction analysis provide justified structure flexible multi agent system
