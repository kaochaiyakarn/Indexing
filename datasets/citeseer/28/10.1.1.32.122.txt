problem discovering language model text database addressed :10.1.1.46.8535
language model describes words indexing terms occur database frequency information indicating term occurs 
method uses query sampling approach 
shown database selection service global search engine learn language model uncooperative database sampling contents database process running carefully selected queries retrieving documents 
contrast problem addressing determine uncooperative search engine database assigns similarities documents respect query 
respect query relative ranking documents unchanged query term weights contain query length normalization factor 
shall discuss discovery constants embedded query length normalization factor
