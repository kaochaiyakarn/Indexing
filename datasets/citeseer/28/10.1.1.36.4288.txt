relational databases querying xml documents limitations opportunities shanmugasundaram tufte chun zhang david dewitt jeffrey naughton department computer sciences university wisconsin madison jai tufte dewitt naughton cs wisc edu microsoft com xml fast emerging dominant standard representing data world wide web 
sophisticated query engines allow users effectively tap data stored xml documents crucial exploiting full power xml 
great deal activity proposing new semistructured data models query languages purpose explores conservative approach traditional relational database engines processing xml documents conforming document type descriptors dtds 
developed algorithms implemented prototype system converts xml documents relational tuples translates semi structured queries xml documents sql queries tables converts results xml 
qualitatively evaluated approach real dtds drawn diverse domains 
turns relational approach handle semantics semi structured queries xml data effective cases 
able issue queries sets xml documents extract synthesize analyze contents 
best way provide query capability xml documents 
glance answer obvious 
xml document example semi structured data set tree structured node tree described label semi structured query languages query evaluation techniques 
viable approach considerable activity semistructured data community focussed exploiting approach :10.1.1.32.3916:10.1.1.41.3062
semi structured techniques clearly ask question best approach take 
downside semi structured techniques approach turns back years invested relational database technology 
really case relational technology start new techniques 
leverage relational technology provide query capability xml documents 
experience implementing system different xml dtds revealed number limitations current relational database systems instances relational technology xml queries awkward inefficient 
relational technology proves awkward queries require complex xml constructs results may inefficient fragmentation due handling attributes sharing causes joins evaluation simple queries 
contribution identification limitations discussion removed 
open question point best approach start relational technology try remove limitations start semi structured system try add power sophistication currently relational query processing systems 
related lot developing special purpose query engines semi structured data :10.1.1.32.3916:10.1.1.41.3062
abstracts submitted xml query languages workshop approach 
goal investigate relational database systems process queries semi structured documents 
sense similar stored 
approach differs important ways
