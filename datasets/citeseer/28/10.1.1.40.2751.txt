querying semi structured data serge abiteboul inria rocquencourt serge abiteboul inria fr amount data kinds available electronically increased dramatically years 
data resides different forms ranging unstructured data file systems highly structured relational database systems 
data accessible variety interfaces including web browsers database query languages application specific interfaces data exchange formats 
data raw data images sound 
structure structure implicit rigid regular standard database systems 
structure exists extracted data 
may bibtex file classification tool style 
may obtain owner creation date fields information extraction phase 
collection objects complex structures parsed 
respect notion type flexible 
issue objects multiple roles objects views :10.1.1.45.855
distinction schema data blurred standard database applications basic principle distinction schema describes structure database data database instance 
saw differences schema data disappear context semi structured data schema updates frequent schema laws violated schema may large queries updates may address data schema 
furthermore context semistructured data distinction may logically little sense 
instance classification information sex person may kept data source boolean true male false female type object class male female 
matter rich model choose features application particular data exchange format covered sgml exceptions 
motivates underlying minimalist data format 
minimalist approach section object exchange model oem aqm data model particularly useful representing semi structured data 
model consists graph labels edges 
early version model pgmw labels attached vertices leads minor differences description information corresponding query languages :10.1.1.47.5182
similar model independently proposed bdhs 
indicate model achieves goals simple flexible powerful allow describing semi structured data common data sources net 
subtle difference oem notion objects object identity bdhs uses tree markers bisimulation 
ignore distinction 
important body literature query languages various perspectives calculus algebra functional deductive see ull ahv concerning structured data 
number proposals concern directly semi structured data 
notably lorel aqm oem model unql bdhs similar model 
developed different motivations languages query documents satisfy needs querying semi structured data 
instance query languages structured documents oql doc cacs integration information retrieval tools acc cm share goals issues considering :10.1.1.48.8190
query languages hypertext structures mw bk cm mw query languages web relevant 
particular query languages web attracted lot attention ql ks focuses extensibility websql mmm provides formal semantics introduce notion locality weblog lss datalog syntax 
theory queries web proposed av 
ql typical line works 
properties set valued set valued oem fact doing 
traversing collections flattening 
providing powerful form navigation database graph 
note path expression interpreted ways set objects paths ii paths 
languages oql doc cacs consider paths class citizen allow path variables range concrete paths data graph :10.1.1.48.8190
simple path expressions viewed form browsing 
alternatively viewed specifying certain line patterns data graph 
consider non line patterns person name ss possibly variables style psi terms 
extended path expressions notion path expression takes full power start conjunction wild cards path variables 
wild card match label leading subobject restaurant 
comparison operator grep return true string cheap appears subobject value 
equivalent query sql oql allow regular expressions wild cards 
example amenable relational calculus translation number wildcards may lead intricate relational calculus equivalent disjunction 
note kleene closure label sequences built path expressions aqm oql doc cacs takes immediately order :10.1.1.48.8190
instance consider lorel query select title shorthand sequence arbitrary labels

extended path expressions powerful primitive construct changes languages essential ways 
study path expressions expressive power compared languages main theoretical issues context semistructured data 
optimization evaluation extended path expressions initiated ccm challenging problem 
information rest variables mentioned difficulty languages semi structured data collections heterogeneous structure components unknown 
returning persons example want say concerned persons having name address possibly fields 
msl pgmw uses notion rest variables mention possibly fields instance res name address rest name address rest city palo alto rest collection heterogeneous tuples :10.1.1.47.5182
literal body rule unify tuple name address 
rest variable unify remaining part tuple 
observe allows filtering tuples having specify precisely internal structure 
approach spirit works functional programming community allow dealing heterogeneous records wan cm rem 
views restructuring database languages traditionally extracting data database 
serve specify views 
notion view particularly important want consider object various perspectives various precisions structure integration heterogeneous data 
need specify complex restructuring operations 
view technology developed object databases considered :10.1.1.45.855
structure start defining view arbitrarily deep nesting cycles pose new challenges 
declarative specification view view defined specifying object population modified hiding objects creating virtual objects relationship objects modified hiding adding edges objects modifying edge labels :10.1.1.45.855
simple approach consists adding hide create vertices edges primitives language core query language specify vertices edges hide create 
yield syntax style define view salary hide select salary persons salary virtual add salary high persons salary vertex creation skolem object naming kks
