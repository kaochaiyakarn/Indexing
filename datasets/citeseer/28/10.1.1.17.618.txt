reclustering high energy physics data martin cern ep division ch geneva switzerland martin cern ch coming high energy physics experiments store data object databases 
analysis jobs frequently traverse collections containing millions stored objects 
clustering effective means enhance performance applications 
presents reclustering algorithm independent objects contained multiple possibly overlapping collections secondary storage 
algorithm decomposes stored objects number independent chunks maps chunks traveling salesman problem 
set realistic assumptions number disk seeks reduced theoretical minimum
