table contents design strategy vr net implementation visualisation discussion surveys highlight internet users frequently frustrated failing locate useful information difficulty browsing linked web structures 
new internet browsing application called vr net addresses problems 
identifies semantic domains consisting tightly interconnected web page groupings 
second part virtual world information sources representing relevant pages plus appropriate structural relations 
significantly indexing engines ignore hyperlinks page search engine bases searching internet hyperlink structure 
indexing engines firstly identify pages containing users search terms apply ranking function identify useful pages 
different indexes functions features frequency term occurrence preference header text presence meta tags previous visitation statistics proximity search terms 
query term context may included search results requires user intervention 
intelligent agents applied assist internet search :10.1.1.31.3135
meta search engines combine results individual indexers combining ranking functions 
techniques appear usefully disambiguate useful topic pages 
shall describe search engine vr net 
site navigation confusing site navigation partly attributed lack browsing context navigating 
designed sites minimise rarely eliminate problem 
site maps common technique minimise disorientation 
internet surfing generally users conflicting options home back forward index search site map plus numerous hyperlinks 
time descend level previous levels links disappear user immediately faced choices level 
array options confusing users leads topic page interest user forcing backtracking causing disorientation :10.1.1.31.3135
thinking web page root tree pages usually back operation returns parent node 
backtracking looses connection abandoned page users expect back eventually list visited pages 
revisit abandoned page users find correct link correct parent page 
unrealistic exploring complex site user may examined pages wishing return page 
point best page appropriate response contain alternative collections pages dealing different aspect query 
effectively forms focused virtual library information provide necessary information 
information retrieval citations long estimate importance academic publications 
hyperlinks uses cite 
authors include web pages hyperlinks topically related web pages new search engines hyperlink structure identify collections documents related topics :10.1.1.43.3498
google search engine extensive link structure plus anchor text identify useful web pages 
search technique similar shall describe technique highlighting differences 
number external links page receives indicate pages merit 
hyperlinks function citations combine links presence query terms approximate genuine citations 
attractors satellites similar authorities hubs 
primary difference firstly authorities individual pages attractors members spread web site 
secondly clever requires iterative process rank pages uses multiple shot functions 
discuss greater detail process identifying authorities hubs
