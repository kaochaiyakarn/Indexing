model probabilistic factor decomposition allows identifying principal topics collection authoritative documents topics 
furthermore relationships topics mapped order build predictive model link content 
applications approach information retrieval search topic identification query disambiguation focused web crawling web authoring analysis 
text book isolated embracing corpus documents embedded 
ideas thoughts described document inevitably relate build previously published material 
traditionally represented citations allow authors explicitly related documents 
vast number documents published electronically world wide web interdependencies documents take form hyperlinks allow instant access referenced material 
way modeling interdependencies understand structure implicit contents connections document base resorting manual clustering classification ranking documents 
main goal joint probabilistic model document content connectivity parameterized stochastic process mimics generation documents part larger collection accurate predictions existence hyperlinks citations

model extremely useful applications identifying topics common subjects covered documents 
representing weakness memory forget times 
documents low dimensional space help understanding relations documents topics cover 
combining evidence terms links yields potentially meaningful stable factors better predictions
