maintaining consistency data mobile distributed environments deal frequent foreseeable variable disconnections occur mobile environment introduce exible level consistency model 
semantically related closely located form cluster 
data inside cluster mutually consistent degrees inconsistency allowed data di erent clusters

allow transactions exhibit certain degrees tolerance inconsistencies introducing strict weak operations 
weak operations operations executed weaker consistency requirements 
replicated databases entails schema placing locating copies concurrency replica control protocols ensuring correctness 
previous research replication mobility mainly addressed rst issue 
propose schemas maintaining consistency replicated data way takes consideration restrictions imposed nature mobile computing 
motivation 
wireless communications mobility introduce new paradigm distributed computing :10.1.1.20.5732
today computer systems depend heavily operation rest network 
mobile computers susceptible network disconnections 
majority disconnections voluntary 
frequently users deliberately avoid network cost power consumption networking capability available current location

users occasionally connected rest network 
handling disconnections discussed extensively context network partition 
frequency forces making part normal operation considering new mode operation called disconnected operation :10.1.1.12.448
furthermore network partitions disconnections involuntary unpredictable result network host failures 
wireless networks deliver lower bandwidth wired networks higher error rates :10.1.1.20.5732
mobile systems characterized high variation network bandwidth shift orders magnitude depending host plugged wireless access type connection current cell

take account locality 
replica control schemas address concerns studied context mobile le systems instance see database community starting address issues :10.1.1.12.448
