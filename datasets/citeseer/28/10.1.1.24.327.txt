cooperative inquiry began march examining exploring robotics lab university maryland 
children adults tried robots asked questions researchers took notes experience 
returned hci lab child adult researcher wrote post notes liked didn robots saw 
table summarizes results 
liked number comments sensors seeing robot examples lab move look robots didn looked plastic brains showing moved slow talked funny unreliable table summary liked didn visiting robotics lab university maryland interesting turned number children adult researchers described robots 
child wrote note don way brains show look 
child wrote re plastic animal research notes march 
field research analysis began create numerous low tech prototypes participatory design techniques :10.1.1.20.8429
