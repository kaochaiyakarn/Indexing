expert system automatic analysis facial expressions rothkrantz faculty information technology systems department knowledge systems delft university technology box aj delft netherlands received august received revised form june accepted january discusses expert system called integrated system facial expression recognition isfer performs recognition emotional classification human facial expression full face image 
system consists major parts 
isfer workbench forms framework hybrid facial feature detection 
multiple feature detection techniques applied parallel 
redundant information define unambiguous face geometry containing missing highly inaccurate data 
second part system inference engine called converts low level face geometry high level facial actions highest level weighted emotion labels

currently available vision techniques difficult design face model accurately represents facial geometric properties 
initial adjustment surface images usually manual affects accuracy recognition results 
similarly accurate dense information facial expression get lost averaged optical flow local facial regions estimated 
existing face models 
modelling facial motion dealing facial image sequences increase performance system 
developing fuzzy expert system face action tracking face action emotional classification increase quality system allowing reason involved face actions accuracy performed facial feature tracking
