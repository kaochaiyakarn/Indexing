relational transducers electronic commerce serge abiteboul rocquencourt serge abiteboul inria fr victor vianu san diego vianu cs ucsd edu brad oracle oracle com yesha umbc cs umbc edu electronic commerce emerging major applications requiring database support 
introduce study high level declarative specifications business models approach spirit active databases 
precisely business models specified relational transducers map sequences input relations sequences output relations 
semantically meaningful trace input output exchange kept sequence log relations 
consider problems motivated electronic commerce applications log validation verifying temporal properties transducers comparing relational transducers 
positive results obtained restricted class relational transducers called spocus transducers semi positive outputs cumulative state 
slightly careful analysis shows complexity number variables fixed complexity np fixed number universal quantifiers needed 
note similar result holds database known decide exists database db log valid 
conclude section remarks previous result spocus restrictions log validation quite expensive 
remains np hard output relations defined conjunctive queries state relations 
view consistency np hard views defined conjunctive queries ad :10.1.1.54.9534
problems simplified transducers 
example reachability positive goal decidable ptime 
restrictions spocus transducers impact complexity denotes properties expressible oe oe np np 
decision procedures considered need investigated 
challenging remaining issue interactions relational transducers specifying business models participants complex exchange 
transducers combined ways having outputs transducers input transducers having share state relations 
raises new issues related verification interacting system business models including consistency detecting resolving deadlock situations plan investigate questions
