type agent softbot single agent general knowledge performs wide range user delegated information finding tasks 
believe centralized approaches limitations 
single general agent need enormous amount knowledge able deal effectively user information requests cover variety tasks 
addition centralized system constitutes processing bottleneck single point failure 
example financial domain human machine agent may interested notified time stock price 
information agents active sense actively monitor information sources proactively deliver information just waiting servicing shot information queries 
information agent may receive messages agents important types goals answering shot query associated information sources answering periodic queries run repeatedly results sent requester time tell price ibm minutes monitoring information source change piece information tell price ibm drops minutes occurrence event 
useful capability added types agents learning 
agents retain useful information interactions training examples utilize various machine learning techniques adapt new situations improve performance :10.1.1.153.2100
agent organization coordination retsina agents distributed different machines directly activated top elaboration current situation opposed indirect activation manager matchmaker agents resolution info source conflict user user user query answer information request reply collaborative query processing interface agent interface agent task interface agent goals task specifications results info source info source information integration task proposed solution info source retsina distributed agent organization self directed activation agent activations dynamically form organizational structure demand fits task user information needs resulting decomposed information requests related software agents 
task organization may change time remain relatively static extended periods 
notice agent organization change result appearance disappearance information sources agent interactions affected appearance disappearance agents capable fulfilling task subgoals new ways
