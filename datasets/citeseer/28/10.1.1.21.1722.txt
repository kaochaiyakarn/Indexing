spatial data structures samet computer science department institute advanced computer studies center automation research university maryland college park md overview spatial data structures spatial databases 
focus hierarchical data structures including number variants quadtrees sort data respect space occupied 
techniques known spatial indexing methods 
hierarchical data structures principle recursive decomposition 
attractive compact depending nature data save space time facilitate operations search 
examples data structures representation di erent data types regions points rectangles lines volumes 
traditionally bucketing methods grid le nievergelt bang le freeston lsd trees buddy trees seeger kriegel applied transformed data representative points 
contrast applying bucketing methods space data drawn dimensions case collection line segments 
principal approaches decomposing space data drawn 
approach buckets data concept minimum bounding enclosing rectangle 
case objects grouped hopefully proximity hierarchies stored structure tree comer :10.1.1.96.6637
tree beckmann guttman example approach 
tree variants designed organize collection arbitrary spatial objects notably dimensional rectangles representing dimensional rectangles 
node tree corresponds smallest dimensional rectangle encloses son nodes 
leaf nodes contain pointers actual objects database sons
