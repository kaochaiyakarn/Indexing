general framework optimization object oriented queries sophie cluet claude delobel yz goal integrate general framework different query optimization techniques proposed object oriented context 
step focus essentially logical aspect query optimization 
propose formalism unifies different rewriting formalisms ii allows easy exhaustive factorization duplicated subqueries iii supports heuristics order reduce optimization rewriting phase 
declarative query languages object oriented database management systems proposed years :10.1.1.50.9598
currently serious concern optimization 
interesting techniques imported environments developed context 
random strategy objects stored order creation unique object space 
clustering policies available expressed placement trees 
orion exodus offer class composition strategies 
model propose query optimization takes account different informations inverse links extents indexes clustering 
languages declarative query languages objectoriented database systems :10.1.1.50.9598
languages mainly differ point accordingly classes 
contains languages allow selection objects database 
languages second class powerful fact possible generate new entities 
chose express queries query language belongs second category
