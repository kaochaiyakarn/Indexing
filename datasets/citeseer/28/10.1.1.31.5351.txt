infrastructural support mobility network monitoring show adaptalk java mobile internet chat application take advantage support dynamically place chat server minimize response time 
sumatra run legal java programs modification 
added functionality provided extending java class library modifying java interpreter affecting virtual machine interface 
design philosophy sumatra provide mechanisms build adaptive mobile programs 
policy decisions concerning move left application 
main feature distinguishes sumatra previous systems support mobile programs communication migration happens application control :10.1.1.17.6050:10.1.1.103.9804:10.1.1.145.8445
furthermore combination distributed objects thread migration allows applications flexibility dynamically choose moving data moving computation 
high degree application control allows easily explore different policy alternatives resource monitoring adapting variations resources 
believe space design choices adaptive mobile programs mapped flexibility important help explore space 
sumatra adds programming abstractions java object groups execution engines 
odyssey project mobile information access plans provide support application specific resource monitoring adaptation 
primary adaptation mechanism consideration change data fidelity 
propose remote execution reducing communication mobile machine static network 
systems location various computation modules fixed adaptation achieved changing way network 
systems built permit executing program move execution example obliq agent tcl emerald telescript tacoma primary distinction systems sumatra sumatra communication migration happens application control :10.1.1.17.6050:10.1.1.103.9804:10.1.1.145.8445
complete application control allows easily explore different policy alternatives resource monitoring adapting variations resources 
studies performed determine internet performance 
mukherjee studied network latency 
observations show round trip times show significant variability sharp peaks exist dominant low frequency components
