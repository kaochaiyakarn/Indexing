managing update conflicts bayou weakly connected replicated storage system douglas terry marvin theimer petersen alan demers bayou replicated weakly storage system designed mobile computing environment includes portable machines ideal network connectivity 
maximize users read write accessible replica 
bayou design focused supporting specific mechanisms detect resolve update conflicts naturally arise system ensuring replicas move eventual consistency defining protocol resolution update conflicts stabilizes includes novel methods detection called dependency checks write conflict resolution client provided merge procedures 
guarantee eventual consistency bayou servers able rollback effects previously executed writes redo global serialization order 
furthermore bayou clients observe results writes received server tentative writes conflicts ultimately resolved 
presents motivation design mechanisms describes experiences gained initial implementation system
