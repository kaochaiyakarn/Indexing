contracts allow agents efficiently accommodate events 
game theory proposed contingency contracts solve problem 
computational agents contingency contracts impractical due large numbers interdependent unanticipated events conditioned events mutually observable 
proposes leveled commitment contracting protocol allows self interested agents efficiently accommodate events having possibility unilaterally decommitting contract local reasoning 
decommitment penalty assigned agents contract freed obligations contract agent pays penalty party 
deals enabled contingency contracts sense full commitment contract agents prefer corresponding fall back positions contingency contract agent prefers fall back 
problems regarding contingency contracts automated negotiation self interested agents 
useful anticipating small number key events contingency contracts get cumbersome number relevant events monitor increases 
limit domain events changes domain problem new tasks arriving resources breaking negotiation events contracts negotiations affect value obligations original contract conditioned 
furthermore events may affect value original contract independently value original contract may depend combinations events :10.1.1.42.237
potential combinatorial explosion events conditioned 
secondly feasible cumbersome contingency contracts computerized agents impossible enumerate possible relevant events advance 
third problem verifying events 
event observable agents 
call contracts leveled commitment contracts decommitment penalties choose level commitment 
method requires explicit conditioning events agent conditioning dynamically 
event verification mechanism required 
presents formal justification adding decommitment feature contracting protocol 
example protocol uses feature :10.1.1.42.237
principles assessing decommitment penalties studied law purpose assess penalty agent contract breach occurred 
similarly penalty clauses partial failure meeting deadline commonly contracts purpose usually motivate agents follow contract 
knowledge possibility explicitly allowing decommitment contract predetermined price studied active method utilizing potential provided uncertain 
somewhat turns mere existence decommitment possibility contract increase agent expected payoff 
loops avoided mechanism decommitment penalties increase time realtime number domain events negotiation events 
allows low commitment negotiation focus moved joint search space making contracts meaningful level commitment 
increasing level commitment causes agents backtrack deeply negotiations save computation 
initially low commitment contracts mechanism facilitate linking deals

contracts appear agent decommit 
similar way initially low commitment contracts mechanism facilitate contracts agents

practical automated contracting settings agents bounded rational example limited computation resources bound capability solve combinatorially complex problems 
fact agent computation bounded induces uncertainty

leveled commitment contracting protocol allows agent continue deliberation regarding value contract contract 
value contract turns lower expected agent decommit 
hand leveled commitment contracting protocol decommitment penalties increase quickly time may appropriate bounded rational agents agents need consider combinatorial number possible worlds alternative combinations occurred :10.1.1.42.237
research decommitment mechanism automated contracting protocols somewhat surprisingly allows agents accommodate events profitably traditional full commitment contracts 
contract specifies decommitment penalty agents involved 
decommit agent just pays penalty agent 
mechanism better suited complex computerized contracting settings contingency contracts potentially combinatorial hard anticipate contingencies need considered event verification mechanism necessary decommitting decided local ex post deliberation
