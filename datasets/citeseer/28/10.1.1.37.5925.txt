adome advanced object modelling environment li member ieee computer society frederick lochovsky member ieee computer society adome advanced object modeling environment approach integrating data knowledge management object oriented technology 
generation information systems require flexible data modelling capabilities provided current object oriented dbmss 
particular integration data knowledge management capabilities increasingly important 
context adome provides versatile role facilities serve dynamic data objects production rules facilitating flexible data knowledge management integration 
prototype implements mechanism associated operators constructed top commercial object oriented dbms rule base system 
index terms object modeling knowledge semantics dynamic roles object oriented databases information systems increasingly organizations require intelligent information management 
centralized uniform code management mechanism favors code reuse provides promising tool incorporating rules system 
particular rules actions may stored managed objects methods 
oodb system excellent enabling technology unified management rules data procedures 
order handle various advanced requirements generation information systems active expert oodbms approach combination dimensions proposed expert database uses deductive reasoning backward chaining referred deductive database system 
exemplified prototypes systems hipac adam ode chimera sentinel :10.1.1.143.6958
system approach allows wide range internal functions external applications supported general extensible manner 
systems implemented developing totally new database kernel scratch building special rule management module inside existing oodbms 
built approach system specific general purpose specially implemented database kernel rule management module easily different oodbmss 
furthermore considerable amount re implementation effort needed modification existing oodbms code may required approach 
methods class constraints employee int age local rules string 
global rules 
ordinary class definition extended role definition discussion role centered approach providing advanced data knowledge modelling capabilities taken adome described offers significant flexibility efficiency data knowledge integration 
embodies practical cost effective approach organization upgrade existing oodb system simply integrating available rule base system added versatile bridging mechanism 
compared systems take built approach hipac adam ode chimera sentinel adome approach relatively efficient terms underlying communication involved systems general purpose costly build :10.1.1.143.6958
due fact bridging mechanism oodbmss little simply change needed existing oodbms code 
obvious advantage approach results attractive products 
example adome rules defined roles 
owner roles serve natural indices relevant rules helps reduce search space rules need retrieved 
knowledge consistency purposes knowledge inheritance hierarchy strict hierarchy multiple inheritance allowed 
able answer simple questions describe basic functionalities system 
basic knowledge system resides project development department available individual agent joe sam belong different organizational units directly related development department 
introducing new unit moap adding knowledge inheritance hierarchy way obviously undesirable organization perform frequent structural changes order accommodate new activities promote new products systems 
possible way supported systems ode sentinel chimera define specific rules object instance level class level attach rules individual objects joe sam explicitly :10.1.1.143.6958
creates serious problem managing maintaining instance level rules number large 
furthermore awkward inflexible objects longer need specific may need acquire 
adome problem naturally addressed role facilities graceful manner 
particular role called marketing rep serving virtual unit moap defined purpose joe sam included players role actual agent marketing rep
