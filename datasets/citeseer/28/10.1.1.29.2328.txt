proposed partitioned view maintenance schemes partitioned view maintenance scheme consists main algorithm takes horizontally partitioned warehouse data cube views changes fact table input returns updated horizontally partitioned cube views 
approach assumes fact table updated 
order warehouse data available users strategy splitting maintenance propagate refresh functions adopted algorithm :10.1.1.41.7788
functions called main algorithm 
maintenance algorithm implements propagate function routine functions aggregate changes aggregate changes view 
formal presentation main algorithm details propagate refresh functions discussed 
propagate function algorithm maintenance called function aggregate creates net change table top view changes fact table
