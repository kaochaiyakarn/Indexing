neuro fuzzy solution integrated visual force control von christian zhang technical computer science faculty technology university bielefeld bielefeld germany spline neuro fuzzy model different tasks vision fine positioning uncalibrated cameras force control 
shown neuro fuzzy controllers low dimensional problems force control high dimensional problems vision sensorimotor control fusing input different sensors 
controllers type modularly combined solve assembly problem 
known general fuzzy rule descriptions systems large number input variables suffer problem curse dimensionality 
realworld applications difficult identify decisive input parameters reduce number input variables minimum 
general solution building fuzzy models interesting theoretical point may extend range applications fuzzy control complex intelligent control problems
