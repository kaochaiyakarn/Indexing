inductive logic programming ilp techniques useful analyzing data multi table relational databases 
learned rules potentially discover relationships obvious data 
statistical learners hand generally constructed search relational data expect single table containing set feature candidates 
statistical learners yield accurate models logical forms ilp better handle certain types data counts 
situations inductive logic programming ilp techniques provide functionality navigate relational structure generate potentially new forms evidence readily available table representation 
unfortunately logic representational language inaccurate domains
