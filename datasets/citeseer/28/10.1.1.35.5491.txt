pesto integrated query browser object databases michael laura john almaden research center san jose ca laura almaden ibm com sciences department university wisconsin madison wi informix com describes design implementation pesto portable explorer structured objects user interface supports browsing querying object databases 
pesto allows users navigate relationships exist objects 
addition users formulate complex object queries integrated query paradigm query place presents querying natural extension browsing 
pesto designed portable object database system supports high level query language addition pesto extensible providing hooks specialized predicate formation object display tools new data types images text 
garlic project ibm almaden research center care developing system associated tools managing large quantities heterogeneous multimedia information 
goal garlic permit traditional multimedia data residing variety existing data repositories including relational databases document managers image repositories files application developers users unified object oriented schema 
pesto stack allows users specify limited class union queries subqueries range underlying collection 
pesto powerful express unions combine objects multiple collections potentially addressed notion 
case intend pesto support objects different types union compatible relational sense wholly incompatible object oriented user interaction model 
plan add degree support pesto sorting aggregates grouping power facilities limited done confines object oriented model 
implementation details enable fast prototyping pesto implemented university wisconsin tcl tk :10.1.1.38.1298
