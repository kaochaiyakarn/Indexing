media laboratory perceptual computing technical report nov appeared spie storage retrieval image video databases ii feb san jose photobook content manipulation image databases pentland picard sclaroff perceptual computing section media laboratory massachusetts institute technology picard media mit edu january describe photobook system set interactive tools browsing searching images image sequences 
query tools differ standard image databases direct image content relying text annotations 
direct search image content possible semantics preserving image compression reduces images small set perceptually significant coefficients 
describe types photobook descriptions detail allows search appearance uses shape third allows search textural properties 
image content descriptions combined descriptions provide sophisticated browsing search capability 
demonstrate photobook databases containing images people video keyframes hand tools fish texture medical data 
representation narrowly tuned target efficiently describe signals trained bad describing signals 
particular content specific representation accurately describes portion image appropriate representation image data 
allows detect instances models asking describe part image 
real time process current workstations computation sufficiently efficient incorporated image preprocessing step 
approach finding faces applied finding wide variety things including eyes cars roads :10.1.1.12.7580
multiple models compete interactive time find stuff including sky trees buildings 
remarked framework searching images matching appearance matching properties 
reasons adopting approach 
matching approach trained directly image data require model 
note input data may grey level color images examples may images extracted edges extracted texture measurements 
voxel data 
regardless type dimensionality input data appearance photobook represents input data terms principal variations mean prototypical appearance input class case know class imaged object forward view face side view face car automatically determine appearance model appropriate new image measuring model describes image data 
accomplished determining set provides best encoding image approach detect occurrences models image 
details procedure described discussed section :10.1.1.47.3791
