describe metasearch engine available nec research institute allows individual search strategies 
search strategy consists different set sources different query modification rules personalized ordering policy 
combine features dynamic interface allows users see current best recommendations displayed times allows results displayed immediately retrieval 
examples single query produces different results ordered different factors accomplished training local database

fusion policy analogous ordering policy regular search engine 
typical metasearch engine dog pile com uses fixed list sources combines results simply listing results original order search engines 
user relatively broad query numerous results 
metasearch engines allow limited personalization 
savvysearch allows users choose category sources specialize area considered :10.1.1.43.8157:10.1.1.43.8157
example user searching news search news specific sources 
approach helps improve precision results guarantee meaningful ordering results 
addition potentially results general purpose search engines specialized ones excluded 
limitation typical metasearch engines inability score results complete content 
choosing sources increase coverage allowing users find greater number relevant pages 
method choosing sources category 
savvysearch allows users choose category news auctions search relevant sources category 
approach runs risk missing results general searched search engines 
profusion attempts predict search engines results query predicting subject :10.1.1.98.4787
inquirus currently uses fixed list sources category include general search engines specific needs ability automatically modify query score results predicted value need 
example user searching news normally search northern light general purpose search engine 
user specify northern light return results order date return results date range 
likewise searching altavista research papers normally return results research papers modifying query add keyword increase precision respect need research papers resulting fewer erroneous results
