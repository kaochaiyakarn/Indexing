learning comprehensible conceptual user models user adaptive meta web search martin muller institute semantic information processing university germany martin mueller cl ki uni de course oyster project goal induce conceptual user models allow transparent query refinement information filtering domain www meta search 
user models describe user interest respect underlying ontology allow manual user model editing process pose defined problem conceptual inductive learning task 
oyster research prototype currently developed university 
user modeling machine learning 
user models represent assumptions user 
user modeling systems infer user models user interaction store user models induce new assumptions reasoning models 
discuss approach provide short summary includes brief overview related projects 
try give precise formal overview interesting user modeling ontology refinement processes oyster 
technicalities truncated respect limited space 
adaptive information retrieval web efficient user modeling recommender systems 
course building recommender systems www projects tackled problem personalized document filtering ary vectors representing user interest :10.1.1.44.1973
implies intertwined representation information resources representation web document vector user models 
vectors represent user interest explicitly describe user interest 
accordingly vector methods perform pretty really mir cl ki uni de oyster explain outcome
