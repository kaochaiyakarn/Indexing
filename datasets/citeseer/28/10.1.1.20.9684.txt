earlier shared rooms built krueger installation art pieces 
drawback electronic collaborative rooms require expensive specialized hardware prohibitive people benefit enhanced support collaboration example school children 
liveboard digital whiteboard tivoli application enabled multiple simultaneous users remote interact shared digital whiteboard 
authors point simultaneous whiteboard rarely occurred speculated lack adequate software level support collaboration kind may cause 
pebbles project investigates handheld personal digital assistants pdas portable input devices sdg setting :10.1.1.67.8565
explored limitations current gui application toolkits needed toolkits support sdg 
implementation sdg mmm 
enabled multiple users interact multiple editors computer display providing user independent input device 
system available research community user studies conducted investigate limitations idea 
system available research community user studies conducted investigate limitations idea 
mmm pursued researchers working transferred technology study multi handed input single users 
researchers investigated sdg technology influence groups learning environment 
showed providing user separate input device gave significant learning improvements device active time 
active device predetermined access protocol :10.1.1.30.3213
important result indicates sdg benefit tasks users expected simultaneously editing 
built software architectures enable building sdg applications teach collaborative skills 
guiding metaphor applications built sdg architecture legged race goal run race faster require participants learn cooperate order able run 
example applications include color matcher users find rgb values color chord matcher users find notes chord 
explored number collaborative interactions require multiple simultaneous users single computer 
goal research create tools strengthen collaborative learning 
enriching existing collaboration computer 
example turn viewed unnecessary cumbersome 
enabling multiple input devices cases enable done parallel making collaboration efficient enjoyable eyes users :10.1.1.62.5304
number studies indicated benefit shoulder shoulder collaboration due collaborators enhanced verbal nonverbal communications pp 

reducing eliminating conflict multiple users attempt interact single application 
difficult create appropriate sharing mechanism shared channels difficult obey mechanism created :10.1.1.62.5304

reducing eliminating conflict multiple users attempt interact single application 
difficult create appropriate sharing mechanism shared channels difficult obey mechanism created :10.1.1.62.5304
providing separate channels potential conflicts pushed step away 
encouraging peer learning peer teaching 
existing single user technology collaborative learning setting competition users interact application inhibit learning benefits collaboration :10.1.1.62.5304
providing applications multiple communication channels possible enrich learning diminishing competition access input channels

providing applications multiple communication channels possible enrich learning diminishing competition access input channels 
strengthening communication skills 
strong users longer task merely controlling input device users may communicate resolve conflicts 
potential benefits new computer paradigm comes potential negative effects new conflicts may arise users attempt simultaneous incompatible actions 
creative projects benefit group activity input restrictive nature current systems limit expression 
potential benefits sdg domain include able effectively working parallel eliminate unnecessary turn 
learning domain users involved exploration new material problem solving environment learning new technology debugging simulations 
learning shown domain group activity important 
learning current computer systems create inequality partners due difference skills restrictions having single input device :10.1.1.62.5304
potential benefits sdg domain include effective learning able time objects reducing cognitive difference partners giving parallel access 
instruction domain user experienced skill knowledge training software peer teaching classroom informal help instructor 
sales domain sales person customer configure items 
crucial point allowing customers play active role selection configuration process may inclined choose product supplier 
combination tools allowed users easily erase simple mistakes easily start scratch erase big mistakes affecting user move lines having erase redraw 
usability test evaluate success ideas conducted usability test involving students rd th th grades elementary school albuquerque nm 
students grouped sex pairs randomly assigned single input device condition sdg condition 
summarize results study 
earlier pilot studies demonstrated need positive interdependence collaborating partner goal structures indicated johnson johnson :10.1.1.62.5304
children involved study told partner team design contest sponsored university new mexico 
researchers building technology kids wanted know kids thought technology wanted technology look 
teams asked complete series drawings entered team effort contest teams compete 
children access kidpad mice depending condition assigned
