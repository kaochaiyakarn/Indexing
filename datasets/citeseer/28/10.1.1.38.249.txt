approximate nearest neighbors removing curse dimensionality preliminary version piotr indyk rajeev motwani department computer science stanford university stanford ca cs stanford edu april nearest neighbor problem set points fp png metric space preprocess efficiently answer queries require finding point closest query point focus particularly interesting case dimensional euclidean space norm 
despite decades effort current solutions far satisfactory fact large theory practice provide little improvement brute force algorithm compares query point data point 
late interest approximate nearest neighbors problem find point ffl approximate nearest neighbor query ffl 
algorithmic results approximate version significantly improve known bounds preprocessing cost polynomial truly sublinear query time query time polynomial log mildly exponential preprocessing cost theta ffl applying classical geometric lemma random projections give simpler proof obtain known algorithm polynomial preprocessing query time polynomial log unfortunately small ffl purely theoretical result exponent depends ffl 
experimental results indicate algorithm offers orders magnitude improvement running times real data sets 
key ingredient notion locality sensitive hashing may independent interest give applications information retrieval pattern recognition dynamic closest pairs fast clustering algorithms

motivation 
nearest neighbors problem major importance variety applications usually involving similarity searching 
examples data compression databases data mining information retrieval image video databases machine learning pattern recognition statistics data analysis :10.1.1.108.8490
typically features objects interest documents images represented points distance metric measure dis similarity objects 
basic problem perform indexing similarity searching query objects 
number features dimensionality ranges tens thousands 
example multimedia applications ibm qbic query image content number features hundreds
