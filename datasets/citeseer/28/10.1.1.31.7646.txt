existing methods position estimation special purpose sensors aim tracking robot position relative known starting point 
describes position probability grid approach estimating robot absolute position orientation metric model environment 
method designed standard sensors independent knowledge starting point 
bayesian approach certainty grids

approaches distinguished type maps rely 
techniques metric grid representations environment generally generate unimodal gaussian distributions representing estimation robot position 
wei store angle histograms constructed range finder scans taken different locations environment 
position orientation robot calculated maximizing correlation histograms new measurements stored histograms
