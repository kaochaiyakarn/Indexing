support vector machines face authentication jonsson kittler university gu xh united kingdom cmp czech technical university prague czech republic studies support vector machines svms context face authentication 
study supports hypothesis svm approach able extract relevant discriminatory information training data 
believe main reason superior performance benchmark methods 
representation space captures emphasises discriminatory information content case fisherfaces svms loose superiority 
svms cope illumination changes provided adequately represented training data 
data feature extraction fisherfaces normalisation svms get trained resulting loss ability generalise 
incoming image referred probe image compared small number model images person identity claimed recognition scenario image descriptor image potentially large database 
second automatic authentication system operate near real time acceptable users 
recognition experiments images people training database system case previously unseen person importance authentication 
field face recognition established large number algorithms proposed literature 
popular approaches include ones deformable templates dynamic link matching eigenfaces :10.1.1.37.9020
techniques vary complexity performance choice algorithm typically dependent specific application 
verification problem hand explored 
examples include robust form correlation applied face authentication 
aim evaluate effectiveness svm approach face authentication

earlier study svms face verification reported phillips 
svm verification system design compared standard principal component analysis pca face authentication method significantly better 
approach svm trained distinguish populations client client difference images respectively originally proposed moghaddam :10.1.1.50.6184
method gives client non specific support vectors 
approach adopt client specific solution requires learning support vectors 
main distinguishing feature reflects focus authentication opposed recognition concern 
primary motivation carrying similar study establish performance svm approach superior 
main decision making tool investigated support vector machine

svms principle structural risk minimisation 
aim minimise upper bound expected actual risk defined jz set parameters defining trained machine class label associated training sample function providing mapping training samples class labels unknown probability distribution associating class label training sample 
denote number training samples choose 
probability bound expected risk holds log log empirical risk measured training set called vapnik chervonenkis vc dimension 
procedure amounts generating roc curves specific distance distributions 
percentile defines client specific offsets 
roc curves produced measuring false rejection false acceptance rates different distance increments measured offsets 
roc curve yielding minimum equal error rate actual increment giving error jointly define client specific thresholds 
experimental results experiments summarised performed frontal face images extended vts multi modal database :10.1.1.35.468
publicly available database contains face images speech recordings persons 
subjects recorded separate sessions uniformly distributed period months session number shots taken including frontal view rotation sequences 
frontal view sequences subjects read specific text providing synchronised image speech data rotation sequences head moved vertically horizontally providing information useful surface modelling head
