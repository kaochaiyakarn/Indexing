www url www usenix org exploring bounds web latency reduction caching prefetching thomas department computer engineering university california santa cruz prefetching caching techniques commonly systems reduce latency 
researchers advocated caching prefetching reduce latency web 
potential significant performance gain best improvement saw caching prefetching reduced total latency 
additionally saw prefetching lead time amount time prefetching begins object needed significantly affects amount latency clients servers proxy internal latency external latency typical proxy configuration reduction 
limited simulator providing minute warning latency reduction dropped 
additionally observe latency reduction caching half data set data objects change 
observation agrees studies show high rate change objects web :10.1.1.30.2529:10.1.1.31.5701
comparing results external latency observe workload examined web latency consists internal latency external latency cached prefetched external latency removed prefetching caching 
key point take results caching prefetching helpful current conditions limit ability reduce latency 
rest article organized follows section categorizes caching prefetching presents methods techniques 
bounds method 
may prefetched seen stream 
model provides bound active caching local prefetching unlimited storage 
model differs passive caching model object changed indicated change size modified timestamp subsequent access object prefetched 
table shows latency reduction bound local prefetching double passive caching see table 
results differ passive cache pays object changes high observed rate change causes poor performance passive caching :10.1.1.31.5701
bounds prefetching server hints simulate server hint prefetching assume prefetching client contacted server time 
simulate combination caching prefetching simulator checks object cache 
simulator uses server hint model determine object successfully prefetched 
table shows contact model requests simultaneously prefetched contact reduce latency little half
