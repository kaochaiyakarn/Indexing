dlove constraints allow parallel processing multi user virtual reality department electrical engineering computer science tufts university ma eecs tufts edu introduce dlove new paradigm designing implementing distributed virtual reality applications way constraints 
dlove allows programs written framework executed multiple computers improved performance 
allows easy specification implementation multi user interfaces 
dlove hides networking aspects message passing machines distributed environment performs needed network optimizations 
result user dlove need understand parallel distributed programming system needs able serial version user interface description language 
parallelizing computation performed dlove modifying interface description
