applications qualitative spatial reasoning research qsr motivated wide variety possible application areas including geographic information system gis robotic navigation high level vision spatial propositional semantics natural languages engineering design common sense reasoning physical systems specifying visual language syntax semantics 
numerous application areas including qualitative document structure recognition notion che biology domains space metaphor 
gis commonplace major problem interaction 
approach development robust qualitative method robot exploration mapping navigation large scale spatial environments described 
qualitative solution known piano mover problem 
qsr computer vision visual object recognition higher level includes interpretation integration visual information 
qualitative symbolic projections possible reason shape objects match geographical objects 
qsr technique interpret results low level computations higher level descriptions scene video input :10.1.1.7.3127
qualitative predicates helps ensure scenes semantically close identical similar descriptions 
natural language interpretation spatial propositions tend ambiguous 
multiple ways natural language spatial prepositions cites di erent meanings lies motivation qualitative spatial representation nding formal way describing prepositions engineering design robotic navigation ultimately normally requires fully metric description 
early stages design process reasonable qualitative description 
point set algebraic topology particularly adapted reasoning forms region relation region region relation region relations may hold 
course possible adapt conventional mathematical formalisms strategy adopted 
existing approach topology qsr community philosophical logic community 
built axiomatic theories space predominantly topological nature take regions points primitive tradition termed pointless geometries 
particular clarke lead development called rcc systems developed :10.1.1.35.7809
ec dc po tpp ntpp illustrations relations rcc calculus continuous transitions conceptual neighbourhood 
clarke took primitive notion idea regions connected sharing point wants think regions consisting sets points 
rcc system interpretation slightly changed closures regions sharing point 
rcc theory points better interpretation suitable distance metric means distance zero 
sections explore di erent ways qualitative information may represented 

orientation orientation relations describe objects placed relative de ned terms basic concepts primary object object frame 
topological relations spatial entities described preceding sections orientation binary relation want specify orientation primary object po respect object ro need kind frame 
characterization manifests display qualitative orientation calculi literature certain calculi explicit relation presuppose extrinsic frame :10.1.1.40.616
explicit relations especially worth mentioning earlier develops calculus function maps triples points qualitative values denoting collinear clockwise orientations respectively 
reasoning visible locations qualitative navigation tasks shape descriptions 
develops calculus reasoning relative orientation pairs line segments 
orientation calculus relation true clockwise orientation shows number qualitative calculi translated system reasoning system implemented constraint logic program exploited 
worth noting similarity ideas rough sets exact relationship explored 
approaches spatial uncertainty relation transitive fails generate equivalence classes development nonmonotonic spatial logics 

qualitative spatial reasoning qsr concentrated representational aspects 
various computational paradigms investigated including constraint reasoning :10.1.1.40.616
prevalent form qualitative reasoning composition table compositional inference deduction relational facts form relational fact form involving validity compositional inferences depend cases constants involved logical properties relations 
case composition pairs relations maintained table look required 
technique particular signi cance dealing relational information involving xed set relations 
set relations store composition table relationships pair relations
