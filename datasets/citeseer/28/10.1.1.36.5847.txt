probabilistic modeling distributed information retrieval christoph university technology germany fi february describes model optimum information retrieval distributed document collection 
model stems robertson probability ranking principle having computed individual document rankings correlated different subcollections local rankings stepwise merged final ranking list documents ordered probability relevance 
full dissemination subcollection wide information required 
documents different subcollections assumed indexed different indexing vocabularies 
local rankings may computed individual probabilistic retrieval methods 
underlying data volume arbitrarily scalable
