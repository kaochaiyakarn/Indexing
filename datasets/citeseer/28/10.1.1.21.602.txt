case parallelism data warehousing olap datta dept mis university arizona tucson az arizona edu moon dept computer science university arizona tucson az cs arizona edu helen thomas dept mis university arizona tucson az helen arizona edu years database community experienced tremendous increase availability new technologies support efficient storage retrieval large volumes data data warehousing line analytical processing olap products 
efficient query processing critical environment achieving quick response times olap queries largely open issue 
propose solution approach problem applying parallel processing techniques warehouse environment 
suggest efficient partitioning strategy relational representation data warehouse star schema 
furthermore incorporate particular indexing strategy improve query processing times parallel resource utilization propose preliminary parallel star join strategy 
years explosive growth databases decision support 
typical relational data warehouse management system tables stored tables stored 
addition base tables retrieval efficiency index structures typically defined especially data warehouses fact table large 
specifically sales table indexed dimensional attributes partkey suppkey 
number indexing schemes proposed literature 
index types shown particularly appropriate olap systems trees indexes projection indexes bit sliced indexes :10.1.1.100.5223
projection index exploits positional indexing strategy 
projection index simply mirror image column indexed 
particular indexing columns fact table index corresponding column comment bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes byte byte bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes rows rows bytes rows rows bytes bytes partkey suppkey quantity tax discount status rows partkey bytes name bytes bytes brand bytes type bytes size bytes bytes part bytes supplier suppkey name address nation region phone comment bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes time month alpha week day bytes year bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes sales fact table dimension table foreign key relation key attribute non key attribute attribute bytes name bytes address bytes nation bytes region bytes phone bytes bytes bytes bytes comment bytes customer attribute sample warehouse star schema comment bytes bytes bytes quantity tax discount status bytes bytes bytes byte byte bytes rows rows rows bytes rows bytes rows rows bytes rows rows bytes rows bytes rows rows bytes bytes partkey bytes name bytes bytes brand bytes type bytes size bytes bytes part bytes supplier suppkey name address nation region phone comment bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes sales sales suppkey partkey sales sales bytes name bytes address bytes nation bytes region bytes phone bytes ordinal mapping bytes bytes bytes comment bytes customer sales time month alpha week day bytes year bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes bytes sales sales fact table dimension table foreign key relation attribute non key attribute attribute key attribute example warehouse schema fact table stored resulting duplication data
