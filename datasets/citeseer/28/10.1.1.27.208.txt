respect represents persistence old mouse oriented metaphor 
contrast modes transmit written input manual gesturing facial expressions capable generating symbolic information richly expressive simple object selection 
example studies users integrated pen voice input indicate speak point pattern comprises spontaneous multimodal utterances :10.1.1.117.6842

interpersonal multimodal communication linguistic analysis spontaneous manual gesturing confirms deictic gestures pointing account gestures 
data highlights fact multimodal system designed exclusively process speak point fail provide users useful functionality 
reason specialized algorithms processing deictic point relations limited practical design multimodal systems 
example successful processing deictic term square rely interpretation pointing word spoken order extract intended referent 
empirical study indicated users speak deictic terms deictic frequently overlapped time pointing 
fact estimated users commands contain spoken deictic overlaps pointing needed disambiguate meaning 
issue deixis users spoken input frequently overlap multimodal commands computer 
illustrated sequentially integrated half time pen input preceding speech brief lag input signals seconds :10.1.1.117.6842
finding consistent linguistics data revealing spontaneous gesturing signed language precede spoken lexical analogues human communication 
degree gesturing precedes speech greater languages chinese subject prominent ones english 
short speech gesture highly interdependent synchronized multimodal interaction synchrony imply simultaneity 
empirical evidence reveals multimodal sig zoom label delete query calculate distance modify move add 
implication multimodal language may easier process support robust systems 
myth multimodal integration involves redundancy content modes 
claimed propositional content conveyed different modes multimodal communication contains high degree redundancy 
dominant theme users natural organization multimodal input complementarity content redundancy see 
example speech pen input consistently contribute different complementary semantic information subject verb object sentence typically spoken locative information written :10.1.1.117.6842
multimodal correction system errors users highly motivated clarify reinforce information delivery speech pen input rarely express redundant information time 
human communication linguists documented spontaneous speech gesturing involve duplicate information 
short actual data highlights importance complementarity major organizational theme multimodal communication
