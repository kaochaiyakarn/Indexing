adding generic contextual capabilities wearable computers jason pascoe computer laboratory university kent kent ct nf united kingdom ext pascoe ac uk context awareness increasingly important role play development wearable computing systems 
order better define role identified generic contextual capabilities sensing adaptation resource discovery augmentation 
prototype application constructed explore capabilities deployed wearable system designed aid observations giraffe game reserve 
despite benefits context awareness demonstrated prototype widespread innovation capabilities currently difficulty obtaining contextual data 
remedy situation contextual information service cis introduced 
installed user wearable computer cis provides common point access clients obtain manipulate model contextual information independently underlying plethora data formats sensor interface mechanisms 
identifies application independent contextual capabilities employed enhance wearable system 
second section case study demonstrates relatively simple context awareness greatly assist user 
final section introduces contextual information service development experiences believe vital facilitate wider technology
