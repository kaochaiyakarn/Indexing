classification classification part system uses nearest neighbor algorithm form research assigning diagnostic codes patients medical records :10.1.1.47.8517
general nearest neighbor algorithm assigns category item computing distance similarity measure item corpus items known category 
assigns new item majority category closest test doc rep search patent collection known subclasses retrieve ranked list retrieved patents subclasses rank subclasses 
assign subclass nearest neighbor classification known items 
various refinements avoid ties take account ranks distances nearest neighbors 
nearest neighbor require training front scales small large data sets 
case patent system distance metric inquery belief score 
query formulated document classified initial stages nearest neighbor classification identical searching 
query submitted inquery 
retrieval engine returns ranked list documents scores 
simply counting number neighbors subclass sum scores neighbors subclass rank subclasses sum 
assign subclass test document 
process illustrated 
user sees ranked list patent subclass codes name subclass 
representation patent documents nearest neighbor classification crucial component nearest classification patent text formulation query patent patent application 
example query patent motorcycle theft alarm seen

classifying medical records inquery operators differentially weight different sections document 
patents entire document entire sections large full detail aid classification 
system selects certain sections fields portions sections removes stopwords stems remaining terms indexing documents

concerning representation patents nearest neighbor classification settled small portion patent document 
research shown best performance vector frequent terms title lines background summary exemplary claim title receiving times weight rest text 
including single terms addition phrases better just single terms 
somewhat surprising result contrast searching phrases improve performance short queries 

system performance speed retrieval time depends factors including load server speed network size query 
environment usually takes seconds retrieve list documents single database response normal short query 
takes seconds retrieve list documents multidatabase 
query long take longer seconds large data structures cached 
retrieval time includes retrieving ranking documents top ranked documents getting class subclass information auxiliary database getting text documents formatting text display example highlighting query terms 
user clicks link see text particular patent response second 
classification time comparable retrieval time dominated retrieval documents required nearestneighbor classification 
currently single collection classification classification short query takes seconds 
classification patent length document takes seconds 
accuracy difficult measure retrieval side system performs 
corpus queries manual relevance judgments allow measurement recall precision 
presently developing set queries judgments collection selection 
measured system accuracy classifying patents complete set subclasses 
done large amount research measuring accuracy nearest neighbor classification smaller sets patent subclasses comparing nearest neighbor accuracy bayesian independence classifiers reported 
small sets subclasses get performance order 
usually bayesian classifiers perform little better nearest neighbor sets 
largest set tested far entire set speech signal processing subclasses subclass class 
difficult set way complete set difficult 
subclasses extremely similar subclasses little training data 
set get classification accuracy ranging depending different factors classifiers built 
nearest neighbor classifiers comparable system accuracy 
difficult interpret numbers take account near misses 
misclassification accrues penalty regardless close automatically assigned subclass correct subclass 
find subclasses closely related correct assignment appear ranked list subclasses user 
list may significant aid classifier correct subclass ranked 
reason accuracy best evaluation metric 

currently engaged evaluating accuracy system mentioned previous section 
addition parts system believe improved involving phrase help subsystem text classification subsystem 
believe building phrase cooccurrence databases class class fine grained 
classes closely related cover concepts 
combine stable reliable set cooccurrence statistics 
combination clustering done manually pto guidance classes go 
currently experimenting bayesian classifiers intend eventually combine nearest neighbor classifiers larkey croft :10.1.1.47.8517
bayesian classifiers able distinguish closely related subclasses due selection negative training examples closely related subclasses 
refine selection nearestneighbor classifier tries distinguish subclass subclasses 
additional available sources information aid text classification 
particular classification schedule includes classification index list phrases pointer appropriate subclass 
list far exhaustive believe cases short query happens match index items accurate means finding subclass
