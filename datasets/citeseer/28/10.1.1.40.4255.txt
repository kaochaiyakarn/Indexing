investigating class logical formulas define constraint theories implement constraint solvers time 
representation constraint evaluation declarative formalism greatly facilitates prototyping extension specialization combination constraint solvers 
approach constraint evaluation specified guarded clauses called constraint handling rules chrs 
chrs define determinate conditional rewrite systems express conjunctions constraints propagate simplify 
concentrate chrs extension constraint logic programming languages 
propagation adds new constraints logically redundant may cause simplification 
repeatedly applied constraint handling engine che constraints incrementally solved cs results false 
chip clp language introduce constructs demons forward rules conditionals vh user defined constraint handling constraint solving simplification propagation 
various constructs generalized chrs
