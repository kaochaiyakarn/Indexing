various internet services electronic commerce information communication systems lives continual availability dominant issue 
continuing software evolution requires system recon guration 
running systems upgrade components change con guration parameters 
addition internet services need serve thousands millions users 
scenario raises con icting issues need resolved availability con scalability 
application scenarios application mobile agents variety distributed computations including distributed dynamic con guration improve performance signi cantly 
provides uniform way deal code mobility disconnected operations
