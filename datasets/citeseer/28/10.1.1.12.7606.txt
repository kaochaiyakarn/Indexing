price simplification businesses today need data stored diverse systems differing capabilities ideally single high level query interface 
design query optimizer garlic middleware system designed integrate broad range data sources different query capabilities 
garlic optimizer extends rule approach heterogeneous environment defining generic rules middleware wrapper provided rules encapsulate capabilities data source 
approach offers great advantages terms plan quality extensibility new sources incremental implementation rules new sources ability express capabilities diverse set sources
