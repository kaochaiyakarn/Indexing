system automatic personalized tracking scientific literature web kurt bollacker steve lawrence lee giles nec research institute princeton nj kurt lawrence giles research nj nec com introduce system part citeseer digital library project automatic tracking scientific literature relevant user research interests 
previous systems simple keyword matching citeseer able track recommend topically relevant papers keyword query profiles fail 
possible heterogenous profile represent user interests 
profiles include representations including content relatedness measures 
citeseer tracking system integrated search browsing facilities citeseer provides user great flexibility tuning profile better match interests 
software system available sample database online public service 
particular rate publication scientific literature grows year making increasingly harder researchers keep novel relevant published 
advent digital libraries technological response overload 
easier methods searching scientific documents researchers expend great deal time effort looking new publications may interest 
periodic newspaper considered roman acta began 
previously introduced citeseer system performs autonomous citation indexing aci scientific publications web :10.1.1.30.6847
citeseer helps users ways traditional digital libraries 
provides facilities browse citation links allows finding citing cited papers interesting 
summarizes citation contexts quick appraisal papers easier gives citation statistics including number citations cited identification self citations 
spending time literature search possibly downloading papers web effort user put search forgotten lost 
forms metadata useful may included version citeseer tracking system 
related papers user performs literature survey topic interest essentially ends collection relevant literature 
specifying keyword metadata constraints user specify interest profile 
may relevant publications cite papers match constraint 
user simply say tell new papers related citeseer able identify papers relatedness measures :10.1.1.33.4795:10.1.1.33.4795
citeseer attempts capture user notion relatedness papers 
task composed major challenges identifying features documents represent useful semantic information ii creating functions features having range space distances represent meaningful semantic distances 
meaningful case defined adequately represents user concept 
attempt approach challenges general documents information retrieval systems 
word vectors citeseer uses tfidf distance abstracts text bodies papers determine newly available related papers specified user 
tfidf relatedness threshold full text considered relevant recommended 
currently threshold tuned hand adjusted user learned user feedback 
total number unique word stems collection documents quite large presenting sparsity problems tfidf 
approached variety ways smallest terms citeseer dimensionality reducing mapping latent semantic indexing :10.1.1.108.8490
citation relatedness word similarity measure useful take advantage specific features scientific publications 
addition word similarity measures citeseer uses common citations estimate document relatedness 
premise scientific papers cite previous publications papers may related 
cited obscure powerful indicator citation extremely known cited publication 
citation relatedness word similarity measure useful take advantage specific features scientific publications 
addition word similarity measures citeseer uses common citations estimate document relatedness 
premise scientific papers cite previous publications papers may related 
cited obscure powerful indicator citation extremely known cited publication 
measure captures idea relatedness called common citation inverse document frequency ccidf partially analogous word vector tfidf :10.1.1.33.4795
frequency citation collection documents inverse frequency vector inverse frequencies 
boolean indicator document contains citation resulting boolean vector 
ccidf relatedness newly downloaded document document interest specified user defined trace function outer product 
document having value set threshold considered relevant 
optimization problem challenging quadratic form completely dense memory requirements grow square number data points 
decomposition algorithm guarantees global optimality train svm large data sets 
main idea decomposition iterative solution sub problems evaluation optimality conditions generate improved iterative values establish stopping criteria algorithm 
experimental results implementation svm demonstrate
