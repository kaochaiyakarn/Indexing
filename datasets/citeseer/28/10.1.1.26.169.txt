efficient multi feature queries heterogeneous environments ntzer 
ling university university germany informatik uni de informatik uni de applications multimedia databases information management systems meet challenge efficiently retrieving best matching objects vast collections data 
new algorithm stream combine processing multi feature queries heterogeneous data sources 
stream combine different data distributions specific kind combining function 
furthermore new retrieval strategy essentially speed output relevant objects 

applications enterprise information portals digital libraries today problems shifted mere retrieval efficiency issues 
considering example combinations multiple classifiers speech recognition immense numbers candidates recognized sentences small grammars 
aim find adequate classifiers improve efficiency finding best candidates looking entire set possible sentences

existing combining algorithms designed homogeneous environments tend deteriorate complexities worse linear scan heterogeneous environments 
architecture system previous approaches field multi feature query combination generally divided statistical approaches guaranteed correctness 
statistical approaches assume certain score distributions output streams estimate far streams fetched calculate best objects arbitrarily high probability type algorithms guarantee correct result set benefit real score distribution stream

favorable qualities remaining refer algorithms delivering correct result sets 
algorithms rely main operations sorted access random access sorted access means access objects getting ranked object output streams larger suitable number objects ordered ranks bulk access feasible contrast random access performed specific score value seen object retrieved classifier 
heterogeneous environments doing random accesses may expensive impossible :10.1.1.52.8723
algorithms mentioned may differ exact number random accesses need considerable number random accesses termination 
new algorithm retrieving top objects combining different atomic output streams needing random access 
algorithm guarantee correct result set output objects successively soon 
heterogeneous environments assumption integration results local attributes identifiers easily mapped appropriate global domain normalization
