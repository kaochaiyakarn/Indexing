modeling video data poses great challenge clear underlying structure traditional databases 
propose graphical object model called 
scheme advantages addition semantics video individual events capture temporal relationships 
inter event relationships allow deduce implicit video information 
research done area video modeling retrieval audio visual content audio color texture motion 
advantage approach features extracted automatically 
low level schemes limited expressing queries 
example di cult ask video clip showing ship movie color texture audio information 
contrast video data models semantic content capable supporting natural queries :10.1.1.33.4691:10.1.1.48.4696
rely partially manual annotation 
limitation approach semantic context dependent 
problem controlled limiting context providing multiple semantic descriptions di erent types applications
