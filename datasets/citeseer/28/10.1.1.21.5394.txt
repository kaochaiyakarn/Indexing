audio driven facial animation audio visual reality kate demonstrate morphing automated audio driven facial animation system 
incoming audio stream face image animated full lip synchronization expression 
animation sequence optical flow visemes constructed incoming audio stream pictures face speaking different visemes 
rules formulated coarticulation duration viseme control continuity terms shape extent lip opening 
addition new viseme expression combinations synthesized able generate animations new facial expressions 
various applications system discussed context creating audio visual reality 
animation sequence constructed 
taken face images corresponding visemes 
viseme images aligned optical flows transition visemes computed total stored 
run time incoming audio stream phoneme viseme mapping corresponding video frame identified transition frames visemes generated optical flows 
morphing animation considered past :10.1.1.13.7486
seek extend include animation expression 
richer scope animation necessary able animate face appropriate expressions 
assumed exists video database head synthesized subject expression synthesized 
system visemes different facial expressions method generate remaining visemes facial expressions 
set images align respect single image repeat process iteratively 

lip synchronization audio timing information extracted incoming audio stream speech recognition unit 
lip movement synchronization extent morph governed timing information 
normalized viseme images intermediate frames generated optical flow morphing techniques similar :10.1.1.13.7486
suppose viseme transition occurs time generate frame time image warping optical flows 
calculate optical flows say say 
viseme warped viseme obtained images cross weighted sense obtain final image generated frame 
restrict extent morph depending viseme duration viseme transition
