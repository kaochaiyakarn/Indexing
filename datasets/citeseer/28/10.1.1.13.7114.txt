association rule important type rules discovered approach :10.1.1.40.6984:10.1.1.50.1686
little done second problem 
method handling incremental database updates rules discovered generalization approach briefly discussed 
previous seen incremental updating association rules 
database updates may introduce new association rules invalidate existing ones important study efficient algorithms incremental update association rules large databases theme 
section discusses variations techniques section concludes study 
problem description mining association rules set literals called items 
db database transactions transaction set items itemset transaction contains association rule implication form 
association rule holds db confidence transactions db contain contain association rule support db transactions db contain tj minimum confidence threshold minconf minimum support threshold minsup problem mining association rules find association rules confidence support larger respective thresholds 
call association rule strong rule distinguish weak ones meet thresholds :10.1.1.12.6495
itemset support similarly percentage transactions db contain minimum support threshold itemset large support 
problem mining association rules reduced problem finding large itemsets pre determined minimum support update association rules set large itemsets database db minimum support number transactions db 
assume support count support number transactions db containing available 
update activities increment db new transactions added original database db number transactions db
