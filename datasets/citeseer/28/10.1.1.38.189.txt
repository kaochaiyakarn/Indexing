important design choice concerns architecture 
questions regarding detailed mechanisms forms representations inference capabilities knowledge best addressed context global architecture different design decisions need linked 
design assemble various kinds functionality complete coherent working system concurrent partly independent partly mutually supportive partly potentially incompatible processes addressing multitude issues different time scales including asynchronous concurrent motive generators 
levels control framework offer gross features human information processing architecture

idea just reactive system may suffer excessive rigidity changing environment may deliberative mechanism 
particular environment deliberative system part internal architecture agent environment changes products deliberative system stored available works early stages agent development may stages 
reasons useful internal monitoring mechanisms able keep records processes problems decisions taken deliberative mechanism perform kind evaluation relative high level long term generic objectives agent determined genetically learnt way including possibly absorbed culture 
generic objectives include things failing tasks allowing achievement goal interfere goals wasting lot time problems turn solvable slow resource consuming strategy turns faster elegant method available detecting possibilities structure sharing actions 
particular requirements concurrency independence various subsystems lead variety kinds states subsystems disturb possibly producing optimal global performance 
human emotional states including states sophisticated occur rats may 
ai researchers believe goal ai design agents overcome human limitations displaying strengths 
may possible limitations inevitable consequences mechanisms architectures required produce strengths
