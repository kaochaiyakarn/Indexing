data mining framework building intrusion detection models lee stolfo computer science department columbia university west th street new york ny sal cs columbia edu need update installed intrusion detection system ids due new attack methods upgraded computing environments 
current idss constructed manual encoding expert knowledge changes idss expensive slow 
describe data mining framework adaptively building intrusion detection id models 
central idea utilize auditing programs extract extensive set features describe network connection host session apply data mining programs learn rules accurately capture behavior intrusions normal activities 
rules misuse detection anomaly detection 
new detection models incorporated existing ids meta learning operative learning process produces meta detection model combines evidence multiple models 
programmer example may emacs highly associated files sequence analysis models sequential patterns 
algorithms discover time sequence audit events frequently occurring 
frequent event patterns provide guidelines incorporating temporal statistical measures intrusion detection models 
example patterns audit data containing network denial service dos attacks suggest host service measures included 
developing framework proposed applying data mining techniques build intrusion detection models :10.1.1.134.4855
framework consists programs learning classifiers meta classification association rules link analysis frequent episodes sequence analysis support environment enables system builders interactively iteratively drive process constructing evaluating detection models :10.1.1.52.7062
product concise intuitive rules detect intrusions easily inspected edited security experts needed 
approach learned rules replace manually encoded intrusion patterns profiles system features measures selected considering statistical patterns computed audit data 
meta learning learn correlation intrusion evidence multiple detection models produce combined detection models

meta learning learn correlation intrusion evidence multiple detection models produce combined detection models 
important point framework eliminate need pre process analyze raw audit data tcpdump bsm output 
see ripper selects unique feature values identifying intrusions 
rules inspected edited security experts incorporated misuse detection systems 
accuracy classification model depends directly set features provided training data 
example features hot compromised root shell removed records table ripper able produce accurate rules identify buffer overflow connections 
showed due temporal nature network events especially certain intrusions probing port scan ping sweep denial service ping death adding host service temporal statistics resulted significant improvement accuracy classification models :10.1.1.134.4855
selecting right set system features critical step formulating classification tasks 
strategy mine frequent sequential patterns network audit data patterns guidelines select construct temporal statistical features 
section discusses process greater detail 
meta classification important reasons combining multiple detection models 
number hot indicators number compromised conditions root shell obtained telnet connection buffer overflow attack 
normal true 
connection normal 
table 
example ripper rules telnet records meta learning mechanism inductively learn correlation predictions number base detection models classifiers :10.1.1.52.7062
resulting combines detection power base detection models 
approach extensively studied empirically evaluated related domain fraud detection shown effective scalable approach 
association rules empirical evidence program executions user activities exhibit frequent correlations system features 
example certain privileged programs access certain system files specific directories programmers edit compile files frequently consistent behavior patterns included normal usage profiles 
add features examine connections past seconds share value current feature count connections service src dst dst host value item sets episode add percentage connections share value current connection add percentage different values value feature lag item sets episode add percentage connections numerical feature add average values 
syn flood pattern results additional features count connections dst host past seconds connections percentage service percentage lag 
open problem decide right time window value mine sequential patterns different values example increment plot number patterns generated run 
experience show plot tends stabilize initial sharp jump 
call smallest stable region reported experiments different values calculate temporal statistical features classification models :10.1.1.134.4855
results showed plot accuracy classifier stabilizes tend taper 
intuitively requirement window size set sequential patterns stable sufficient patterns captured noise small 
adding temporal statistical features 
order construct appropriate features detect intrusion need select right axis features generate distinguishing useful intrusion patterns
