addresses issues developing open multiagent systems easy expand functionality adding new agents new capabilities facilitate interoperability agent systems 
argue open multiagent system define support elements agent communication 
common set speech acts define types messages agent send agent 

common service ontology agents describe capabilities reason agents capabilities needed execute specific tasks 
means providing agents common understanding specific messages message types common understanding dialogs occur pairs agents subgroups agents specifically designed 
furthermore agents self describing common service ontology assimilated agents facilitates integration agents new capabilities 
specifically address issues involving inter agent communication impact openness multiagent system 
keys open communication multiagent system need agents communicate obvious 
loose standards agent communication proposed kqml fipa cases corba :10.1.1.125.3310
furthermore information integration area multiagent systems sufficiently similar evolved point reasonable start attempt interoperation 
agent system infosleuth 
infosleuth supports dynamic set agents spread network collaborate information retrieval integration 
experience far led appreciate need standard open agent architectures allow easy integration new agents existing multiagent system allow easy interoperation related multiagent systems 
experiences infosleuth illustrate issues 
propose keys communication open systems include shared set speech acts verbs provide structure discourse agents common service ontology shared set nouns adjectives provides dictionary meta information agent capabilities shared set prescriptive conversation policies provide structure basic agent dialog 
greater extent shared information supported easier agent integration interoperation 
requirements separate communication issues involved shared domain ontology domain communication language execute domain specific tasks

suggests borne observations strong overlap speech acts required agent systems small comprehensive set sufficient multiagent systems 
currently efforts defining standard comprehensive set speech acts 
unfortunately efforts reached point agreement single illocutionary act represented differently different multiagent systems 
interoperability systems may understand speech acts 
reminder discuss key open communication proposed section context infosleuth implementation 
section discusses related issues concludes 
speech acts kqml standard set speech acts open systems provides structure agent discourse intended meaning content speech act said easily interpreted 
infosleuth chosen build kqml define set speech acts system 
kqml effort define standard useful set speech acts performatives agents exchange information semantics performatives :10.1.1.125.3310
performatives number fields parameters associated addition content performative contextual parameters specify language ontology message 
routing parameters specify sender receiver 
factoring contextual routing information content message standard manner goal agents receiving message able analyze possibly route message independent understand content 
important research issue question content information pushed level performative 
suggests eventual goal inter system service ontology feasible 
representation service information agent service information potential represented number different ways respect semantic level encoded 
specifically issue question service information encoded speech act level encoded content speech acts 
existing approaches range spectrum 
kqml specification suggests advertise performative exchange service information embedded advertise performative ask agent supports :10.1.1.125.3310
kqml pushes capability description entirely speech act syntax 
kqml advertise embedded performative sufficient mechanism exchange capability information infosleuth ontology 
simple example agents answer ask query 
type agent different capabilities respect query 
messages initiating agent uppercase messages responding agent lowercase 
agents acknowledge tell message 
inappropriate decide expect response basis agent sending tell wish maintain open agent system 
infosleuth finite state machines case pushdown automata specify allowable pairwise conversations agents system 
similar approach :10.1.1.125.3310
shows example conversation type 
transition start states models correspond sending conversation initiating message 
remaining transitions define acceptable message agents time 
final states indicate conversation
