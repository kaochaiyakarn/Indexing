realtime personal positioning system wearable computers aoki bernt schiele alex pentland mit media laboratory aoki bernt sandy media mit edu toshiba center japan context awareness important functionality wearable computers 
particular computer know person environment 
proposes image sequence matching technique recognition locations previously visited places 
single word recognition speech recognition dynamic programming algorithm proposed calculation similarity different locations 
system runs stand wearable computer pc 
training sequence dictionary locations created automatically 
happened meet bob street

computer able navigate way unknown place 
furthermore important reminders shown worn display user particular location supermarket 
context awareness thad starner discussed example example user supervisor office probably important meeting want interrupted phone calls mail :10.1.1.135.9915
realize functions computer needs know user locations 
outdoors global positioning system gps may track movements 
indoors active tags may take role transmitters doors obviously difficult task gps available inside buildings 
approach recognize location camera 
stuck door computer may find place easily reading code 
barcode object recognition text recognition may help computer detect place 
computer vision approaches analyze pictures 
accurate segmentation object character needed 
starner showed place detection method introducing hmm transition rooms :10.1.1.135.9915
clarkson showed method segment label audio video sequences worn camera microphone 
propose realtime personal positioning system uses small wearable camera shown standalone pc 
previous demonstrated dynamic programming algorithm recognize user location approaching trajectory 
tested accuracy system second video sequences manually chosen segmented 
thirdly introduce method choose suitable trajectories location dictionary automatically 
recognition stage user doesn need tell system look dictionary 
lastly larger sets training test data evaluation 
dictionary extracted real video sequence minutes seconds testing done independent video sequences random walk minutes seconds 
introduce accuracy scales similar ones :10.1.1.135.9915

section overview system 
section histogram calculation frame similarity measurement video segments explained 
section method automatically select location location dictionary discussed 
dictionary doesn contain trajectory fewer trajectories failures detecting trajectory considered errors 
second part test walk third floor detected expected 
ground level lower level test walk
