emerging technique development multiagent systems 
number reasons software developer may consider multiagent system 
particular multiagent systems provide benefits processing speed reduced communication bandwidth increased reliability 
academic community industry trying determine problems call multiagent approach :10.1.1.101.5226
designer decision multiagent design number methodologies exist building multiagent systems 
methodologies range extensions existing object oriented methodologies new agent oriented techniques offer new perspective developing multiagent systems increasing level abstraction developer uses analyze design system 
agent oriented software engineering techniques popular software engineers select particular approach best suited problem solving 
research air force institute technology focused providing software engineers managers decision making framework determine appropriate methodology faced set viable software engineering methodology alternatives 
section provides context applied criteria decision making framework 
section presents 
related techniques strategy taken jennings wooldridge provide intellectual justification validity agent oriented techniques 
justification comes qualitative analysis technique addresses principles allow software engineering techniques deal complex problems proposed booch abstraction decomposition hierarchy
