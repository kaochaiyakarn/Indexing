extending communication model level individual communicative acts model uses cm starting point requires extensions take account constituent structure natural language multimodal multi party nature meeting dialogue 
multimodal communication 
basic cm assumes mapping layers neglecting multimodal expression speech gesture natural conversation simultaneous verbal gestural pass point cup please 
model multimodal communication extend multiple media concepts medium language signal transmitted medium message encoded language single communicate event allow encode action produce multiplicity messages language generate physical signal medium speech characterized employing medium sound writing text employs medium ink natural human gesture employs language medium light additionally basic association physical layer events various media encoded definitional axioms subclasses embody event speak draw hear read see encoded subclasses sense sensory half model 
asserting events independent symbolic informational layers may optionally serve represent events accidental ink marks produced appropriate mode determined linguistic communicative function 
constituent structure 
despite addition dimension supporting multimodality cm remains single symbolic entity message physical signal domain interpretation mode 
extending model natural language particular providing basis automatic nl processing course require complex representation includes multiple layers utterance representation cm internal constituent structure representations individual words phrases utterances 
keeping cm model take messages equivalent signs lexical syntactic semantic phonological gestural representations expressed properties thereof 
framework follows general ontology linguistic description positing recursively defined messages message 
units built constructions composition generating collection units forming unit units form construction unit construction 
generic classes realized medium subclasses allowing information modalities expressed framework

semantics 
case gestural acts knowledge referent fully characterize information component communicative model 
units natural language semantically complex need annotated meaning multiple constituent levels 
handled linguistic constituent including message potentially having logical form component allowing express propositional content constituent referential content individual words phrases suitable 
component may expressed semantics ontology component domain ontologies allowing direct linking system knowledge base 
additionally high levels noise due speech recognizer errors ungrammatical speech prevalent multi party dialogue full propositional semantic annotation usually possible highest level message robust fragment parsing approach semantics representation allows posit event entity role representations possible leaving entities roles underspecified 
communicative roles 
basic cm contains simple representation relations individuals communicative act 
recipient agent events model 
natural multi party conversation overly simplistic 
people may acts direct addressees intended addressee utterance gesture may entire group subset third party talk individual 
basic model support algorithms addressee detection subsequently turn initiative management interactive system 
add addressee set roles person may play communicate event 
modeling discourse structure extensions described far restricted individual communicative acts 
section describes extensions allow express relations acts providing integrated model discourse event structure 
dialogue structure 
notion discourse structure expressed considering individual communicate events dialogue moves expressed membership particular subclasses interrelation expressed properties associated subclasses 
class moves nominally independent layer 
fundamental level consider move effect immediate short term context generic act level compatible scheme 
includes basic acts statement question backchannel intentional acts propose challenge see 
simply label moves antecedent property express discourse structure directly relating move antecedent 
level restrict moves having single antecedent allow multiple moves share antecedent results tree structure able express simple adjacency pairs multiple possibly simultaneous threads represented branches tree 
take tree discourse structurally related set individual communicate acts required semantically pragmatically coherent constraints structural relations 
constraints classes move serve antecedents course expressed directly constraints antecedent property associated classes answers queries antecedents backchannels antecedent moves different speakers 
intention model move structure discourse effect emerging context combine approach notion information state constraints update 
allows express information state update approach familiar dialogue processing directly requiring separate dialogue management module rule set 
set believe advantageous automated processing learning allowing multiple constraint types considered simultaneously

taxonomies combine high level analysis discourse type monologue discussion physical actions participants presence whiteboard note 
earlier taxonomy included activities argumentative dimension discourse consensus disagreement appear analysis :10.1.1.10.3248

contrasting approach suggests simple taxonomy contrasting multi party multi directional exchange information uni directional exchange attain high coverage low ambiguity
