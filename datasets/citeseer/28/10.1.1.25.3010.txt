accomplished embedding ideas linear region quadtrees able support spatio temporal query processing 
improve query performance additional pointers added leaf nodes 
resulting access method called time split linear quadtree 
algorithms processing spatio temporal queries adapted new structure 
queries appear multimedia systems geographical information systems gis searched content 
group codewords share transaction time codeword represents spatial subregion 
additional pointers added leaf nodes aiming increased query performance 
resulting called time split linear quadtree
