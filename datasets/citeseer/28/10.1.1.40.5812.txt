show violation contexts deontic independence give new analysis notorious paradoxes deontic logic 
deontic logic traditionally philosophers analyze structure normative language 
eighties deontic logic discovered computer scientists logic formal specification verification wide variety topics computer science overview see 
example deontic logic formally specify soft constraints planning scheduling problems norms 
advantage norm violations create inconsistency formal specification contrast violations hard constraints
