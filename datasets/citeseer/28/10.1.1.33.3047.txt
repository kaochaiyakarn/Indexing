deterministic annealing clustering compression classification regression related optimization problems kenneth rose member ieee invited deterministic annealing approach clustering extensions demonstrated substantial performance improvement standard supervised unsupervised learning methods variety important applications including compression estimation pattern recognition classification statistical regression 
method offers important features ability avoid poor local optima applicability different structures architectures ability minimize right cost function gradients vanish case empirical classification error 
derived probabilistic framework basic information theoretic principles maximum entropy random coding 
application specific cost minimized subject constraint randomness shannon entropy solution gradually lowered 
emphasize intuition gained analogy statistical physics annealing process avoids shallow local minima specified cost limit zero temperature produces hard solution 
alternatively method derived rate distortion theory annealing process equivalent computation shannon rate distortion function annealing temperature inversely proportional slope curve
