representation spatial knowledge daniel hern andez technische universitat munchen germany mukerjee indian institute technology india tutorial aimed ai researchers engineers interested representing reasoning spatial knowledge shape size relative position connectivity need represent spatial knowledge explicitly arises applications diverse geographical information systems image analysis robot navigation natural language understanding visual modeling 
tutorial highlight progress representing space different levels abstraction particular emphasis applications 
compare traditional quantitative approaches qualitative hybrid approaches 
cover interval algebras application block image structures documents 
give overview extant approaches representation arrangement topology orientation size distance shape corresponding reasoning mechanisms 
way shall discuss general representational aspects frames points vs extension granularity vagueness illustrate particular applications ffl block layout analysis documents ffl extended spatial query languages gis ffl hybrid model conceptual design involving shapes provide extensive course notes covering broader material possibly hope cover actual presentation hope obtain early feedback registered attendees focus issues greater audience interest
