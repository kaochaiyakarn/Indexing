learning similarity space middle east technical university department computer engineering turkey study suggest method adapt image retrieval system configurable 
basically original feature space content retrieval system nonlinearly transformed new space distance feature vectors adjusted learning 
transformation realized artificial neural network architecture 
cost function defined learning optimized simulated annealing method 
experiments done texture image retrieval system gabor filter features 
results indicate configured image retrieval system significantly better original system
