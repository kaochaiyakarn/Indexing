cori set databases search cori approach creates database selection index database represented terms document frequencies df 
databases ranked query variant inquery document ranking algorithm 
collection wide information cwi distributed environment document scores different databases comparable raw score merge feasible 
second merging approach default inquery multi database merging algorithm 
approach uses combination score database score document estimate normalized score 
database score computed differently database selection approaches 
cori database selection normalized database score computed follows raw database belief score database see definition raw belief score maximum minimum scores database obtain particular query :10.1.1.51.7726:10.1.1.38.7535

normalized document score document initial score computed highest score document get query database lowest score document get query database 
normalization done restrict document scores range scenarios enable comparison distributed centralized performance judge impact cwi distributed retrieval different scenarios 
centralized testbeds documents located single database 
referring back hypothesis find rbr selection employed possible exceed centralized performance testbeds 
referring portion hypothesis see possible meet exceed centralized performance small number databases selected rbr selection 
see decreased effectiveness high document ranks small number databases selected 
decreased effectiveness due combination effects 
effect phenomenon concerned xu croft queries relevant documents top ranked databases :10.1.1.21.1736
second effect aspect evaluation approach 
relevant documents available top databases exist queries available relevant documents may retrieved top documents 
retrieved documents evaluated precision document cutoff queries low 
queries average precision values high document cutoff values 
report minimum maximum average values ratio 
note table ubc testbed tends databases relevant documents relevant documents database 
due constraints employed creating ubc testbed documents database 
note relevant documents evenly distributed udc testbed 
xu croft expressed concern distribution relevant documents distributed databases organized publication source database size hinder distributed retrieval performance :10.1.1.21.1736
