third goal compare effectiveness distributed centralised retrieval environment 
background section provides background distributed information retrieval server selection web 
distributed information retrieval distributed information retrieval system normally comprises document servers search servers broker 
receiving query providing results centralised search server need perform disk io computation 
broker distributed information retrieval 
broker selects subset servers retrieves results server creates single merged results list presentation user 
slower performing selection retrieval finished results list arrives network merging 
previous studies distributed retrieval server selection effective centralised retrieval :10.1.1.26.106
results show central index index documents document servers 
decision approach depends system goals resources availability
