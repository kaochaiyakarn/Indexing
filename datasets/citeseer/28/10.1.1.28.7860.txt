second order networks wall building agents frederick michael dyer cs ucla edu dyer cs ucla edu ucla computer science los angeles ca describes robust groups agents perform construction tasks 
enable agents balance multiple goals perform sequences actions survive building walls corridors intersections patches 
purpose developing controlled agents build structures building materials dimensional continuous environment consisting circular objects called discs 
agents complete sequential building tasks performing tasks necessary survival eating drinking predators 
order perform construction tasks properly important agents neural control mechanisms exhibit balance multiple goals robust sequencing backtracking conflict resolution 
agent able perform long sequences actions
