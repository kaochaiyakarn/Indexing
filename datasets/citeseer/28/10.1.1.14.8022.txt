crawling hidden web raghavan hector garcia molina computer science department stanford university stanford ca usa hector cs stanford edu current day crawlers retrieve content publicly indexable web set web pages reachable purely hypertext links ignoring search forms pages require authorization prior registration 
particular ignore tremendous amount high quality content hidden search forms large searchable electronic databases 
provide framework addressing problem extracting content hidden web 
stanford built task specific hidden web crawler called hidden web hiwe 
describe architecture hiwe number novel techniques went design implementation

crawling hidden web challenging problem fundamental reasons 
issue scale study estimates size content available searchable online databases times larger size static web result prudent attempt comprehensive coverage hidden web 
second access databases provided restricted search interfaces intended humans 
turn leads types dynamism temporal dynamism page containing time sensitive dynamic content exhibits temporal dynamism 
example page displaying stock list latest world news headlines fall category 
definition requests temporally dynamic page different points time may return different content 
current day crawlers crawl temporally dynamic pages 
key issue crawling pages freshness measure date crawled collection compared latest content web sites :10.1.1.40.4718
analyses crawling strategies cho maximize freshness applicable context :10.1.1.18.1519

hiwe hidden web basic actions hidden web crawler hiwe similar traditional crawlers :10.1.1.22.3686:10.1.1.43.1111
left indicates typical crawler loop consisting url selection page retrieval page processing extract links 
note traditional crawlers distinguish pages hiwe architecture forms 
shown right hiwe execution sequence contains additional steps pages forms detected 
specifically hiwe performs sequence actions form page 
implementation crawler configured stay actions form analysis module pre determined set target sites provided crawl manager startup links pointed sites 
crawl manager hands downloaded page parser module 
turn parser extracts hypertext links page adds url list structure 
sequence operations repeated termination condition typically number hours elapsed satisfied

process forms extract hidden content hiwe employs additional modules lvs table 
form analyzer form processor analyzer modules implement iterative sequence steps outlined previous section 
lvs manager responsible managing additions accesses lvs table 
provides interface various application specific data sources supply new entries table 
instance consider shows tree structured representation different pages form directly embedded main body embedded table 
pruned tree constructed subtree form element nodes path form root 
addition layout need perfect fact implementation uses simple custom layout engine discards images ignores font sizes uses default font ignores information bold italics break ties mentioned ignores associated style sheets

normalization consists sequence steps counter possible errors extraction extracted pieces text searched html tags html entity 
observed extraction technique able achieve accuracy extracting labels accuracy extracting domain values 
manually inspecting html markup random sample forms noticed association domain values corresponding form widgets significantly affected complexity layout association labels form widgets 
expect simpler techniques analyzing html text perform reasonably domain value extraction 
layout technique extract labels overhead layout information extracting domain values 
crawler performance metric traditional crawlers deal publicly indexable web metrics crawling speed scalability page importance freshness measure effectiveness crawling activity :10.1.1.22.3686:10.1.1.151.5202:10.1.1.40.4718
metrics captures fundamental challenge dealing hidden web processing submitting forms 
considered number options measuring performance hiwe 
coverage ability extract content databases possible conceptually appealing difficult estimate compute information databases 
similarly relevancy question extracted content application task performed useful difficult compute exhaustive manual inspection 
forms processed crawler encounters number different finite domain elements able contribute new entries lvs table 
addition lvs manager uses new entries retrieve additional values data sources described section 
result crawl contributions crawler directly indirectly responsible additional successful form submissions
