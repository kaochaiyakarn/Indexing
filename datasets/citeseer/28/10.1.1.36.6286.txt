problem text mining discovering useful knowledge unstructured text attracting increasing attention :10.1.1.104.4522:10.1.1.47.7462
suggests new framework text mining integration information extraction traditional knowledge discovery databases kdd 
traditional data mining assumes information mined form relational database 
unfortunately applications electronic information available form unstructured natural language documents structured databases 
information extraction task attracted increasing attention start message understanding conferences addresses problem transforming corpus textual documents structured database 
module locates speci pieces data raw text resulting database provided kdd module mining 
text text data mining information extraction rule base kdd db overview text mining framework constructing system dicult task signi cant progress machine learning methods help automate construction systems 
manually annotating small number documents information extracted fairly accurate system induced labeled corpus applied large body raw text construct large database mining 
way small amount labeled training data learning system automatically transformed large database structured information ready mined traditional kdd methods

applying standard rule induction methods database jobs automatically extracted newsgroup discovered interesting relationships computer related job requires knowledge java graphics requires knowledge 
accuracy current systems built manually induced data limited 
automatically extracted database inevitably contain significant numbers errors 
important question knowledge discovered noisy database signi cantly reliable knowledge discovered cleaner traditional database
