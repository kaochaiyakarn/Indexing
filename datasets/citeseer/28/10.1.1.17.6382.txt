advocate learning method deductive inductive strategies combined efficiently learn control knowledge 
approach consists initially bounding explanation predetermined set problem solving features 
proof set sufficient capture correct complete explanation decisions control rules acquired refined applied incorrectly new examples 
method especially significant applies directly nonlinear problem solving search space complete
