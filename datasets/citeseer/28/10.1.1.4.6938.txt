kleinberg algorithm algorithm computes scores document hub score authority score 
documents high authority scores expected relevant content documents high hub scores expected contain links relevant content 
intuition follows 
document points hub document documents point authority 
set nodes neighborhood graph 
node hub score authority score 
initialize anda 
vectors converged normalize vectors 
kleinberg proved vectors eventually converge termination guaranteed :10.1.1.120.3875:10.1.1.120.3875
practice vectors converge iterations 
documents ranked hub authority scores respectively

ran algorithms base queries considered documents top hub authority scores 
set top authority documents algorithms pooled randomly independently rated relevance volunteers 
ratings combined final relevance rating document decided majority vote 
topics pca performs poorly uses quota documents suggesting larger quota allowing pruning successful 
example case graphic design pca quota eliminate set irrelevant documents containing automatically generated links 
links pointed authority placed irrelevant documents top hub list
