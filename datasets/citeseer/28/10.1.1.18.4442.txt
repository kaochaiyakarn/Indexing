massachusetts institute technology artificial intelligence laboratory memo december systematic nonlinear planning david mcallester david rosenblitt presents simple sound complete systematic algorithm domain independent strips planning 
simplicity achieved starting ground procedure applying general independently verifiable lifting transformation 
previous planners designed directly lifted procedures 
ground procedure ground version tate nonlin procedure 
tate procedure required determine prerequisite step plan guaranteed hold 
allows tate procedure avoid chapman modal truth criterion 
defining procedure additional definition needed 
definition nonlinear plan necessarily complete called order inconsistent topological sort 
transitive closure algorithm determine nonlinear plan order inconsistent 
nonlinear plan order inconsistent causal links safety conditions plan define cycle plan steps 
search procedure bounded depth procedure iterative deepening korf :10.1.1.91.288
procedure takes incomplete nonlinear plan cost bound searches completion plan total cost steps completion greater bound 
initially procedure called partial nonlinear plan contains start finish steps corresponding strips planning problem 
assume set allowed operations 
procedure find completion
