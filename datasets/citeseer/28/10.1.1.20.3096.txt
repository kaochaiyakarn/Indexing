incremental document clustering web page classification wai chiu wong ada wai chee fu department computer science engineering chinese university hong kong hong kong 
mail cse edu hk motivated benefits organizing documents web search engines consider problem automatic web page classification 
employ clustering techniques 
document represented feature vector 
analyzing clusters formed vectors assign documents cluster class automatically 
contributions propose feature extraction suitable web page classification 
traditionally document classification task carried manually 
order assign document appropriate class people analyze contents document 
large amount human effort required 
research conducted automatic text classification 
approach learn text classifiers machine learning techniques :10.1.1.55.3252:10.1.1.43.9670
algorithms set positive negative training examples learning text classifiers 
quality resulting classifiers highly depends fitness training shall terms web pages web documents documents interchangeably 
examples 
terms classes world wide web just web new terms concepts created everyday 
typically feature corresponds key word phrase appearing set documents 
entry vector stores numeric weight corresponding feature document 
extracting feature vectors documents apply clustering algorithm set vectors conventional high dimensional data clustering 
resulting document clusters representative features key words phrases document support cluster reported user 
clustering algorithms introduced high dimensional data mining example means clarans birch cure clique :10.1.1.13.4395
existing clustering algorithms general suitable solve document clustering problem 
means clarans birch require supply number clusters 
unfortunately number clusters classes document set usually unknown user 
major issue document databases facing high rate update 
lemma gives flexibility combine clusters gives dc value combined cluster 
lemma dc additivity dc id dc id dc entries disjoint document clusters disjoint means document belong cluster time 
new dc entry cluster formed merging disjoint clusters id id number extracted features 
considered alternatives measuring similarity document feature vectors classical vector space model 
measure called cosine correlation commonly measure similarity feature vectors documents :10.1.1.43.9670
larger cosine value indicates similar 
second similarity measuring method uses euclidean distance common similarity measuring method high dimensional data clustering :10.1.1.13.4395
third alternative manhattan distance 
performed experiments manhattan distance gives similar better results uses computation time compared methods
