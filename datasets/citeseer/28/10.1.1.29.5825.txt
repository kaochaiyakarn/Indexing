object orientation ers promising ways meet demands advanced database applications 
object oriented philosophy creates powerful synergy development life cycle combining abstraction encapsulation modularity 
past decade various object oriented data models developed 
major problem objectoriented approach lack logical mathematical foundations traditionally playing important role database research 
foundation essential de ning semantics databases queries database design query optimization 
object relational databases combine important object oriented features nested relational object databases 
extends relational databases richer type system including object orientation adds constructs relational query languages sql deal added data types 
past decade lot ort integrate deductive object oriented databases gain best approaches logic revised logic logic iql logres rol datalog :10.1.1.29.6773
surveyed dood models developed extending integrating existed deductive objectoriented data models limited object oriented features lack logical semantics 
fully implemented persistent database management systems 
objective olog system develop techniques advanced intelligent information systems directly support ective storage ecient access inference large amount data complex structures

overcomes problem associated iql 
ectively integrates useful features deductive languages de ned logical semantics 
olog system developed mainly sun sparcstation running solaris 
implemented persistent database system supports olog query language sql data de nition language data manipulation language 
tree indices reside memory disk de ning maintaining keys relation

combines query processing methods rol relationlog supports evaluation strategies matching semi naive bottom evaluation rule ordering magic set rule rewriting technique matching olog intensional information derived rules maintained system :10.1.1.29.6773
kept main memory memory space permits persistent maintained current system 
user query concerns information main memory olog nd query results immediately disk operations 
user query concerns information stored disk olog uses indices nd required information
