model unistroke writing time computer human interaction group dept computer information sciences fin university finland cs uta fi unistrokes viable form text input pen user interfaces 
heterogeneous group gestures common feature drawn single stroke 
unistroke alphabets proposed including original unistrokes cube 
comparing methods usually requires lengthy study writers results biased earlier handwriting experience writers 
simple descriptive model comparisons easier 
propose model predicting writing time expert user unistroke alphabet enabling argumentation properties different writing methods 
course assumes nature movement change 
example writer move arm just fingers wrist shape velocity curve probably change 
underlying assumption attempt describe time requirements different handwriting characters human information processor certain maximum rate produce process information 
furthermore assume writing different characters requires different amounts information processed order move pen 
light fitts law research assumptions unreasonable :10.1.1.42.583
task identify critical features characters estimate amount information needs processed order write characters 
features need measured uniform scale easily measure amount time needed feature unit produce writing time estimates
