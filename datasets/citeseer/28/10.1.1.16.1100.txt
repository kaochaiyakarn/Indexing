synthesis lifelike gesture finding growing attention human computer interaction 
particular synchronization synthetic gestures speech output goals embodied conversational agents new paradigm study gesture human computer interface 
context contribution presents operational model enables lifelike gesture animations articulated rendered real time representations spatiotemporal gesture knowledge 
various findings production human gesture model provides means motion representation planning control drive kinematic skeleton comprises degrees freedom joints main body dof hand 
model conceived enable cross modal synchrony respect coordination gestures signal generated text speech system 
incorporates means motion representation planning control produce multiple kinds gestures 
gestures parametrized respect kinematics velocity profile duration phases shape properties 
addition emphasis issue peak timing produce accented parts gesture stroke precise points time synchronized external events stressed syllables synthetic speech
