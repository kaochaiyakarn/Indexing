attracted great deal interest especially years due progress logic programming logic knowledge representation 
logic abduction described formally follows logical theory formalizing particular application domain set atomic formulas describing manifestations set usually atomic formulas containing possible individual hypotheses find explanation solution suitable set consistent logically entails consider instance example domain motor vehicles inspired rich mixture lean mixture rich mixture high fuel consumption lean mixture low oil low water rich mixture lean mixture low oil low water high fuel consumption mixture low mixture low abductive explanations manifestations note mixture lean ruled explanation inconsistent easy see logic abduction form nonmonotonic reasoning :10.1.1.31.9982

logic abduction particularly suitable conditions applies ffl domain knowledge best represented logical theory involves disjunctive information integrity constraints negative information expressed easily simple mappings causes effects 
ffl rich knowledge relationship causes effects available behavior system case component failures 
domain theory set firstorder sentences called system description describing system functions 
system description involves literals form ab express component behaves correctly abnormally 
system behaves incorrectly iff ab hg inconsistent 
diagnosis set ab gamma ag fab hg consistent

console torasso carefully compare approaches point logic abductive approach leads precise diagnoses 
konolige comes shows abductive approach offers advantages interested representation domain knowledge 
notice bylander shown map consistency diagnosis set covering abduction problem 
consistency approach diagnosis particularly useful description system functions properly components faulty 
polynomially transform abductive reasoning problems default autoepistemic reasoning tasks take advantage existing algorithms proof procedures 
conversely abductive reasoning engine solve problems nonmonotonic logics
