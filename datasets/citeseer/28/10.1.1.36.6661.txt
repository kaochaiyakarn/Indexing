growing popularity world wide web placing tremendous demands internet 
key strategy scaling internet meet increasing demands cache data near clients improve access latency reduce network server load 
unfortunately research area hampered poor understanding locality sharing characteristics web client accesses 
popularity web proxy servers provides unique opportunity improve understanding small number proxy servers see accesses thousands clients 
general framework emerging organizes client side caches hierarchy 
bottom web browser caches 
browsers configured direct requests nearby proxy server provides second level caching proxy caches connected third level cache 
highest level cache typically cooperative cache connects lower level caches cache satisfied siblings 
cooperation achieved multicasting misses siblings maintaining shared directory cache contents :10.1.1.21.1584
caching provided geographically distributed caches servers push popular data 
promise client side caching demon research prototypes largescale experiments higher level web caching 
date researchers little data client access patterns base designs assess 
main reasons lack workload information 
proxy act second level web cache web browser level 
configuration proxies popular environments universities due caching benefits 
typically simple matter configure proxy record object requests receives client browsers 
access traces collected proxies clients collections second level proxy servers 
third level proxies suggested harvest project :10.1.1.21.1584
ensure web client access traces compromise user privacy 
client request includes requesting host ip address may identify user requested object url 
privacy concerns prohibit exposing information identifies users objects access 
solution pre process traces study requesting host ip address way function permits compare addresses equality protecting user privacy 
web data access traces collected access traces proxy servers distributed internet

objects accessed small number hosts log scale axis somewhat hides feature
