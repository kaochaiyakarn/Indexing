fs parsons sierra qmw ac uk february need negotiation multi agent systems stems requirement agents solve problems posed interdependence 
negotiation provides solution problems giving agents means resolve conflicting objectives correct inconsistencies knowledge agents world views coordinate joint approach domain tasks benefits agents concerned 
propose framework system argumentation permits agents negotiate order establish acceptable ways solving problems 
framework provides formal model argumentation reasoning negotiation details design philosophy ensures clear link formal model practical instantiation describes case study relationship particular class architectures belief desire intention agents
