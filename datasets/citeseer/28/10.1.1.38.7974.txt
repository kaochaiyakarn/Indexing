july robust finger tracking multiple cameras jennings university british columbia vancouver canada jennings cs ubc ca gives overview system robustly tracking position orientation finger closely spaced cameras 
accurate results obtained combining features stereo range images color images 
provides design framework combining multiple sources information including stereo range images color segmentations shape information various constraints 
information robust model fitting techniques track highly constrained models deformable objects fingers 
natural hand gestures fairly low bandwidth communications particularly suitable indicating spatial relationships 
mouse dof pointer proven useful hci hand gestures provide dof 
stereo imaging provides number advantages imaging camera 
range images simplify segmentation hardest problems robust systems 
range images stabilize depth component positions help solve scale problem object appears smaller image moves away 
previous gesture recognition attracted interest researchers years 
explored novel human computer interface mouse method directing robots replacement television remote controls :10.1.1.152.8786
review provided 
literature hand segmentation performed ways controlled background known background background subtraction segmentation motion color segmentation 
controlled known backgrounds problematic dynamic environments background change time 
motion cues difficult apply due false impression motion caused changing light small camera motions 
extension system takes tracked blobs cameras gives tracking data 
system rely heavily color segment objects track 
learn background image ignored 
pfinder suffer problems cause background subtraction color tracing fail 
tracking facilitated special markers correlation combination color shape constraints :10.1.1.152.8786
lowe system model tracking edge detection image fits lines edges 
edges matched model edges best search approach 
model parameters solved weighted squares approach 
system careful approach errors matching measurement allows quickly find match weight residuals robust finger tracking multiple cameras overview dominated outliers converges large motions
