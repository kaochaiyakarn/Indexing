bbq visual interface integrated browsing querying xml kevin yannis papakonstantinou university california san diego la jolla ca yannis cs ucsd edu bbq blended browsing querying graphic user interface seamlessly browsing querying xml data sources 
bbq displays structure multiple data sources paradigm resembles drilling windows directory structures 
bbq allows queries incorporating sources 
queries constructed query example qbe manner dtds play role schema 
queries arbitrary conjunctive queries groupby results subsequently refined 
support query refinement bbq introduces virtual result views standalone virtual data sources constructed user queries elements data sources ii subsequent queries class data sources 
relational database searches querying bbq schema driven xml dtds web searches assume user advance sure focused query result interested 
system emphasizes navigation schemas data query results iteratively refined 
support query refinement having query results sources subsequent queries 
users construct query result document essentially virtual view document class data source bbq meaning browsed queried construct query result document 
facilitate perception query result source automatically inferring dtd query statement source dtds mix view inference module pv :10.1.1.43.6459
furthermore data query result obtained structure discovery module figures structure elements loosely specified keyword source dtds displays accordingly 
bbq built mix mediator dom client api provides efficient platform virtual views 
particular mix mediator lazy implementation dom called dom retrieve source objects absolutely necessary 
ideal framework browsing large query results user may eventually browse small part query result refines query 
constraints set data sources 
second tree representing query result schema created dragging dropping elements 
third xmas query generated submitted mediator 
fourth dtd generated query result query result schema data displayed 
recall generating schema query result done just query statement source dtds described pv :10.1.1.43.6459
xmas queries form construct head body body describes constraints set data extracted head describes data displayed 
discussion clear step query cycle corresponds constructing xmas body step head 
sections show example set constraints construct head respectively 
setting constraint degree 
filtering implicitly performs steps query cycle filter immediately evaluated results available explicit construction head 
particular filtering takes place follows 
browsing xml dtd pane user may decide constrain elements collection view elements satisfy constraint 
constraint set just shown constraints dialog ok time user hits execute query button 
query result dtd dtd constrained selected elements computed view inference module pv able change source dtd structure order account refinement induced conditions :10.1.1.43.6459
example user places condition optional subelement selected element query result dtd indicates required field absent qualify answer
