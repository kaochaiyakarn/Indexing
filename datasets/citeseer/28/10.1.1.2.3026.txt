major issues need explored regard real time index concurrency control adapt conventional icc protocols realtime domain 
motivation including additional complexities described 
transaction index model performance metric applies entire transactions individual index actions 
model user transaction consists multiple index actions mechanisms ensuring transaction serializability implemented 
point single key index operations range multiple key index operations supported range queries form important component index usage 
rtdbs transactions usually assigned priorities reflect system resources transaction urgency relative concurrently executing transactions earliest deadline policy example assigns priorities order transaction deadlines :10.1.1.36.8216
priorities resolving data conflicts lower priority transaction usually aborted happens possess data item required higher priority transaction 
addition aborts caused priority resolution data conflicts transaction aborts arise firm deadline rtdbs due transactions missing deadlines killed 
taken transaction aborts common rtdbs conventional dbms 
conventional dbms aborts usually resolve data deadlocks deadlocks occur infrequently practice
