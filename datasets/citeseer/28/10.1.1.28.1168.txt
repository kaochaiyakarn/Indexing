proceedings fourth international web caching workshop san diego california april pages simultaneous proxy evaluation brian davison department computer science rutgers state university new jersey new brunswick nj usa davison cs rutgers edu www cs rutgers edu davison simultaneous proxy evaluation spe architecture designed evaluate multiple web proxies parallel object requests duplicated passed proxy 
spe architecture reduces problems unrealistic test environments dated inappropriate workloads additionally applicable content prefetching proxies 
intended measure byte object hit rates client perceived latencies cache consistency 
characterize space proxy evaluation methodologies place architecture 
presents new architecture evaluation proxy caches 
initially grew research techniques prefetching web caches 
client requests sent proxy multiplier sends copy proxy cache evaluated directly collector 
cached copy requested item available proxy cache returns proxy sends request proxy collector 
proxy collector cache filling requests cache possible fetches directly necessary 
proxy cache 
helpful particular commercial proxies general eliminates requirement detailed knowledge algorithms source code needed simulation specialized code additions logging respectively :10.1.1.52.8154
typically proxy caches run di erent machines simple tests may necessary 
alternately software di erent hardware configurations tested architecture 
order prevent proxy cache issuing request destination web server utilize proxy collector functions cache eliminate extra tra generated 
standard cache eliminate duplicate requests normally resulting posts generated cgi bin scripts designated private 
available traditional proxy cache may need collector means attempt cache objects return objects accurate timing characteristics 
allows calculation hit rates comparative average latency values 
additionally proxies may able handle firewalls may attempt fetch objects directly 
passing requests proxies tested multiplier may need configured fetch requests cgi forms urls containing directly 
di culties include implementing robust multiplier collector high load measurements needed proxies need able handle higher load best black box proxy tested support times connections number black box proxies :10.1.1.52.8154
general di culty significant spe architecture proxy collector manage large number connections 
result architecture suited stress testing proxies provides insight performance non peak workloads 
representative applications demonstrate potential spe architecture scenarios 
exhibits aspect spe architecture valuable evaluating alternative proxies 
extended corrected version appears research report digital equipment western research laboratory december
