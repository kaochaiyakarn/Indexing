report results experiments feature selection functions varying values performed reuters standard tc benchmark 
key importance able vectors shorter number words occur document collection usually number tens thousands 
feature selection techniques select original set features subset features useful compactly representing meaning documents value called reduction factor 
usually techniques consist scoring feature means feature evaluation function selecting features highest score 
feature selection beneficial tends reduce overfitting phenomenon classifier tends better classifying data trained classifying data
