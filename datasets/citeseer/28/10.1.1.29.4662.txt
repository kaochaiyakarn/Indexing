capabilities query rewriting mediator systems yannis papakonstantinou ashish gupta laura haas ibm almaden research center number users today integrate broad range information sources provide different levels query capabilities 
currently data sources different limited capabilities accessed writing rich functional wrappers primitive sources dealing sources lowest common denominator 
explores third approach mediator ensures sources receive queries handle advantage query power source 
propose architecture enables identify key component architecture capabilities rewriter cbr 
provide language describe query capability data sources 
cbr takes input description data sources capability 
descriptions may recursive allowing description infinitely large supported queries 
addition may may schema specific 
example may describe capabilities relational database wrapper referring schema specific relational database 
additional benefit grammar description language appropriately augmented actions translate target query query underlying information system 
feature described discuss :10.1.1.48.7185
second contribution cbr architecture algorithm build plans answering target query csqs supported underlying sources 
problem generalization problem determining query answered set materialized queries views lmss rsu 
cbr uses description potentially infinite queries opposed finite set materialized views 
problem identifying csqs compute target query sources restricted case discussed lmss rsu 
unneeded attributes projected plan refinement module 
note pruning represented csqs lose plan algebraically optimal plan involves represented query discovered cbr 
intuitive proof claim plan corresponding representative plan derived replacing csqs representatives 
plan refinement component considers plans represented representative plan sure cbr algorithm lose plan 
complete proof appears pgh :10.1.1.29.4662:10.1.1.29.4662
evaluation representative csq head arity pruning represented queries eliminates gamma represented queries eliminating exponential factor execution time size output csq discovery module 
ask csq discovery phase remove variables projected 
reason projection step better done plans formed time information available csqs plan way interact see section 
postponing projection pushes part complexity stage eliminates complexity altogether 
definition set consumed subgoals csq set subgoals csq constitutes set consumed subgoals 
exports distinguished variable target query appears 
exports join variable appears appears subgoal target query csq unique maximal set consumed subgoals superset set consumed subgoals 
intuitively maximal set describes largest contribution csq may plan 
proof uniqueness maximal consumed set appears pgh :10.1.1.29.4662:10.1.1.29.4662
algorithm states compute set maximal consumed subgoals csq 
annotate csq set maximal consumed subgoals algorithm input csq target query output csq computed annotation method insert subgoals remove subgoals distinguished attribute exported repeat size unchanged remove subgoals remove subgoals join variable subgoal join variable exported discard csq empty 
algorithm polynomial number subgoals variables csq 
algorithm discards csqs relevant target query definition relevant csq csq called relevant non empty 
algorithm discards csqs relevant target query definition relevant csq csq called relevant non empty 
intuitively irrelevant csqs pruned cases contribute plan consume subgoal 
note decide relevance csq locally considering csqs may join 
pruning non relevant csqs build efficient plan construction algorithm cases section produces plan time polynomial number csqs produced csq discovery module 
rare scenarios see extended version pgh relevance criteria may erroneously prune csq part plan :10.1.1.29.4662
may avoid loss plans pruning irrelevant csqs sacrificing plan construction algorithm 
consider option 
join variables condition case union consumed subgoals csqs equal set target query subgoals csqs form plan 
particular possible join csqs may constitute plan 
plan construction algorithm section summarize conditions sufficient construction plan 
efficient algorithm finds plans satisfy theorem conditions 
evaluate algorithm performance 
theorem csqs corresponding heads answer sets maximal consumed subgoals sets needed bindings plan answer vm answer vn correct ffl consumed sets condition union maximal consumed sets equal target query subgoal set 
ffl join variables condition set maximal consumed subgoals csq join variable csq contains set maximal consumed subgoals exports ffl bindings passing condition csq exports proof theory containment mappings appropriately extended take consideration nested loops pgh :10.1.1.29.4662
algorithm plan construction theorem 
step algorithm selects csq consumes subgoal consumed csq considered far variables exported assuming algorithm csqs csq discovery module construct set satisfies consumed sets bindings passing conditions time polynomial join variables condition hold algorithm takes time exponential may create exponentially sets find satisfies join variables condition 
join variables condition evaluates true wrappers find practice see discussion usually construct plan time polynomial plan may plans identical modulo permutation csqs worst case permutations number csqs useless generate permutations plan algorithm creates total order oe input csqs generates plans considering csq csq oe csqs considered order oe 
note bindings passing condition imposes partial order csqs executed plan
