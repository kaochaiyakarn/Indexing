medmaker mediation system declarative specifications yannis papakonstantinou hector garcia molina jeffrey ullman computer science department stanford university stanford ca usa mediators integration heterogeneous information sources 
system declaratively specifying mediators 
targeted integration sources unstructured semi structured data sources changing schemas 
illustrate main features mediator specification language msl show facilitate integration describe implementation system interprets msl specifications 
applications require integrated access heterogeneous information stored sources different data models access mechanisms lmr gup 
tsimmis data integration system provides integrated access architecture see common projects wrappers fk called translators pgmw convert data source illustrated :10.1.1.47.5182
typical example electronic mail objects defined fields destination source addresses vary 
furthermore fields constantly added modified 
situation arises medical records bibliographic infor source information information source source information source integrated view user application user application integrated view mediator mediator wrapper wrapper wrapper oo view source oo view tsimmis architecture integration mation knowledge representation frames 
oem model applications deal unpredictable unstructured information model data item associated descriptive label 
pgmw defined self describing data model called object exchange model oem captures essential features models practice :10.1.1.47.5182
generalizes allow arbitrary nesting include object identity 
illustrate oem model consider objects object line person set 
name string george jones 
department string cs 

bindings ln fn obtained decomp functions name 
call bound parameter joe chung obtain ln chung fn joe 
address problem materializing oem objects clients 
various issues strategies discussed pgmw :10.1.1.47.5182
rules look matching rule heads 
head matches rule considered resulting objects added result 

binding step combine single binding step submit query cs obtain binding rest 
projects adopted defined oo models facilitate integration examples 
described sections oem features suitable integration heterogeneous information systems 
difference oem conventional oo models oem simpler strong typing system 
oem supports object nesting object identity features classes methods inheritance supported directly 
classes methods emulated pgmw :10.1.1.47.5182
believe msl mediator specifications tend short simple avoid questions class view objects complicate object oriented view definition ab 
spite simplicity msl quite powerful 
instance allows construction arbitrarily complex object structures xsql kks 
msl oem seen form order logic
