battery aware static scheduling distributed real time embedded systems addresses battery aware static scheduling distributed real time embedded systems 
suggested previous reducing discharge current level shaping distribution essential extending battery lifespan 
propose battery aware static scheduling schemes 
optimizes discharge power profile order maximize utilization battery capacity 
second targets distributed systems composed voltage scalable processing elements pes 
performs variable voltage scheduling efficient slack time re allocation helps reduce average discharge power consumption flatten discharge power profile
