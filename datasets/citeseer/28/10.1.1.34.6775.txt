sophisticated coordination strategies problem solving situations 
presents learning method acquire coordination plans specific problem solving situations appropriate type coordination strategy 
learning accomplished recording analyzing traces inferences problem solving 
analysis results identification situations inappropriate coordination strategies caused redundant activities lack timely execution important activities degrading system performance 
analysis create situation specific coordination plans additional non local information activities networks added system remedy problem 
coordination levels result important jobs executed timely manner messages sent right time redundant job execution 
assumed lack coordination result serious side effect 
situations requiring coordination level payoff utility coordination sufficient tighter coordination situations leads unnecessary communications control inferences reducing local problem solving efficiency 
job requested example receiving agent uses modification derived attached rating number decided requesting agent receiving agent analyze important 
coordination level implies local control decisions involve partial global view goals activities agents :10.1.1.48.8362
view achieved agents exchanging non local data current hp scheduled plans resource usages intermediary results observed data agents 
partial global view enables agent understand problem solving state agents control decisions local tasks execute optimize network problem solving performance local problem solving 
coordination necessary avoid serious side effect interactions agents environments
