vickrey auction favored main characteristics requires low bandwidth time consumption possesses dominant strategy bid true valuation see section sealed bid auction bids expressing private values remain secret characteristics vickrey auction protocol particularly appealing point view automation 
vickrey auction original formulation selling goods resource allocation works follows bidder sealed bid expressing amount willing pay bidder submits highest bid wins auction price winner equal second highest bid 
task assignment scenarios vickrey auction works exactly way round reason referred reverse vickrey auction bidder willing execute task bid expressing amount wants task execution bidder submitting lowest bid wins auction winner receives amount second lowest bid payoff second lowest bid minus prime costs execution
