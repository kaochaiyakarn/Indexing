ka community portal allows providing browsing retrieving information various means ontology support staab 
way usage semantic annotation underpinning semantics fact retrieval integration presentation remained major system 
content organized follows 
community portals information typically provided users portal portal driven community community 
maintaining web portal knowledge acquisition community gained experience difficulties providing information portal semantic annotations 
give brief sketch ka community web portal 
broader methods tools developed context staab 
portal main component ontobroker decker uses ontologies provide integrated view distributed heterogenous information sources :10.1.1.34.7488
ontology means capturing domain knowledge generic way provides commonly agreed understanding domain may reused shared communities applications 
ontology semantically annotate web pages accessed ontobroker ontobroker system consists crawling component ii knowledge base iii inference engine iv query interface 
crawler collects informa ka portal aifb uni karlsruhe de tion contained registered web pages stores knowledge base 
html pages manually annotated special semantic tags proprietary extension html compatible common web browsers 
manual semantic annotations html main source information ka portal stems distributed web pages maintained members ka community 
web pages manually annotated explicitely represent semantics contents cf 

huge amount relevant information communities represented html chose enhance html semantically relevant extensions 
resulting annotation language html decker adds html primitives tagging instances concepts relating instances setting properties ontology serves schema semantic statements pages :10.1.1.34.7488
primitives html anchor tag extended special attribute 
decision implies original information sources hardly changed provide semantically meaningful information 
semantic tags embedded ordinary html text way standard browsers process html pages time ontobroker crawler extract semantic annotations 
kind semantic annotation resembles knuth programming knuth semantically relevant formal statements embedded unstructured prose text 
described section experiences showed necessity ergonomic knowledge annotation
