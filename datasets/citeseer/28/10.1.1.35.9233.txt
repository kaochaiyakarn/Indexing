adaptive query processing internet applications ives university washington cs washington edu alon levy university washington alon cs washington edu daniel weld university washington weld cs washington edu daniela florescu inria rocquencourt daniela florescu inria fr marc friedman marc com area data management internet gained popularity focused effectively dealing unpredictable dynamic data volumes transfer rates adaptive query processing techniques 
important requirements internet domain include ability process xml data streams network addition working locally stored data dynamic scheduling operators adjust delays flow rates sharing re data multiple queries possible ability output results update 
equally important consideration high degree variability performance needs different query processing domains ad hoc query application optimize display incomplete partial incremental results corporate data integration application may need best time completion may strict data freshness guarantees 
goal tukwila project university washington design query processing system supports range adaptive techniques configurable different query processing contexts 
past years new set requirements query processing emerged internet web query systems prevalent 
emerging data management domain queries posed multiple information sources distributed wide area network source may autonomous may potentially data different format 
ad hoc interactive query domain user may wish see incomplete results quickly business business environment emphasis may providing complete results quickly possible strict guarantees data freshness 
tukwila project university washington data integration system attempt answer queries posed multiple autonomous heterogeneous sources 
data sources mapped common mediated schema 
data integration system attempts reformulate query series queries data sources combine data common result 
tukwila ancestors information manifold lro razor fw focused problems mapping reformulation query planning tukwila attempts address challenges generating executing plans efficiently little knowledge variable network conditions :10.1.1.38.7636
goal tukwila support efficient query processing streaming xml data adaptive query processing techniques including display incremental results sharing sub results queries 
conjunction believe need method expressing query processing policies providing different query performance behaviors different contexts 
discuss number important areas addressed adaptive techniques effective wide area xml data integration system 
organized follows section overview different dimensions adaptive query processing underly research agenda tukwila system 
controlling adaptive behavior important need dealing network query sources ability respond unexpected conditions slow data sources failed sources amounts data larger expected order handle conditions tukwila incorporates event condition action rules respond execution events operator start timeout insufficient memory pipeline forth 
response events tukwila return query optimizer re optimize remainder query plan modify memory allocations operators switch alternate set data sources 
note rules lower granularity triggers active rules respond events sub operation level modify behavior query plan operators 
intra operator adaptivity tukwila system provides operators respond varying network conditions produce optimal behavior 
implementation pipelined hash join wa extensions support overflow large hash tables disk ways resembles hash ripple join hh uf :10.1.1.104.4432
pipelined hash join operates hash tables single hash table typical hybrid hash join 
tuple read operator inputs stored input hash table probed opposite table 
input executes separate thread provides highly desirable characteristics allows overlap computation important bound environment produces output tuples early possible 
pipelined hash join adjusts behavior data transfer rates sources
