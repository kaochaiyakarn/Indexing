argumentation abduction disjunctive logic programming wang department computer science technology university beijing china email edu cn propose argumentation semantic framework called das disjunctive logic programming 
basic idea translate disjunctive logic program framework 
unique feature proposed framework consider disjunctions negative literals possible assumptions represent incomplete information 
framework semantics pdh cdh wfdh defined kinds acceptable hypotheses represent credulous moderate skeptical reasoning ai respectively 
semantic framework extended wider class disjunctive programs called bi disjunctive logic programs 
addition serious attempt establishing argumentation theoretic framework disjunctive logic programming das integrates naturally extends key semantics minimal models egcwa founded model disjunctive stable models 
problem extending gcwa founded model wfm class general disjunctive programs pursued researchers opinion generalizations gcwa wfm intuitive simple wfdh 
earlier attempts generalize wfm class disjunctive logic programs mentioned deficiency semantics interprets normal disjunctive programs positive programs 
example disjunctive program bg equivalent disjunctive program bjc employing stable models sakama defined extension gcwa called gcwa generalization incompleteness disjunctive programs stable models 
employing efficient disjunctive logic program systems dlv tested semantics disjunctive programs test results demonstrate das suitable semantic framework 
brass dix proposed new approach wfs founded semantics dlp defined weakest semantics satisfies properties :10.1.1.36.5106
particular semantics provides extension wfm gcwa 
wfdh wfs quite different intuitions quite possible semantics coincide 
fact currently working clarifying relationship wfdh wfs
