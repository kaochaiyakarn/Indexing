main language mechanisms representing partial complete information sets tuples new ordering interpretations captures intended semantics nested sets tuples relations 
appropriate stratification restrictions shown unique minimal supported model exists computed bottom intended semantics program 
past decade lot interest nested relations tuple components may sets tuples relations :10.1.1.21.4143
extended relational algebra calculus kind databases proved equivalent 
important direction intense research languages datalog database query languages 
languages provide natural way express queries relational database 
furthermore allowing recursion negation obtain language powerful relational algebra calculus

important direction intense research languages datalog database query languages 
languages provide natural way express queries relational database 
furthermore allowing recursion negation obtain language powerful relational algebra calculus 
years efforts combine approaches mainly extending datalog set tuple constructors :10.1.1.99.3180
example col set valued data functions deal sets 
col lacks model theoretic semantics proper ordering interpretations models missing 
models compared subset relationship shown inappropriate 
strata stratified col program may infinite incomparable minimal models simple subset ordering
