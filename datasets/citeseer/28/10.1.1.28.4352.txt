combining inductive deductive inference knowledge management tasks fernandes department computer science university manchester oxford road manchester pl united kingdom email fernandes cs man ac uk indicates different logic programming technologies underpin architecture distributed knowledge management higher throughput information supply achieved semi automated solution challenging problem knowledge creation 
proposes working definitions notions data knowledge information purely logical terms shows existing technologies combined inference engine referred knowledge information data engine integrating inductive deductive capabilities 
briefly introduces notion virtual organizations uses set stage virtual organizations exemplify value adding potential knowledge management contexts 

current pace change technological organizational economic contexts project little likelihood slowing 
creates significant challenges management knowledge information data 
solution particularly relevant market situations ability exploit opportunities requiring extremely short life cycles vital competitiveness issue 
situation characterized market opportunities emerge recommend setting virtual organization vo business 
aspect broader problem addressed founded systematic manner knowledge creation 
somewhat surprising insofar foundations attempt expansion data integration goals encompass knowledge creation place context particularly suits database view deductive database paradigm 
foundations lie research inductive logic programming ilp :10.1.1.27.4632
ilp applies classical machine learning techniques induction logic programs 
inducing examples logic program characterizes concept function form knowledge creation 
database concepts formulated logic programs database states views integrity constrains implicit data schema definitions interest ilp techniques semi automate design tasks formulation views integrity constraints stored data additionally complementing examples

induction denotes ilp engines proposed literature data knowledge syntax semantics assumed de :10.1.1.27.4632
means uniform wellfounded approach creating knowledge induction deploying disseminating deduction insofar acquired knowledge available generate information deductive inference 
observation suggests useful build inference engines combining deduction induction 

inference engine notion kid engine embodies attempt integrate deductive inductive inference logic programming techniques
