approximate statistical tests comparing supervised classification learning algorithms thomas dietterich cs orst edu department computer science oregon state university corvallis december reviews approximate statistical tests determining learning algorithm performs particular learning task 
tests compared experimentally determine probability incorrectly detecting difference difference exists type error 
widely statistical tests shown high probability type error certain situations 
tests test difference proportions paired differences test random train test splits 
third test paired differences test fold cross validation exhibits somewhat probability type error 
fourth test mcnemar test shown low type error
