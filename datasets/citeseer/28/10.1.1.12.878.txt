nodes positioned perfectly placing usually yields correct recognition 

hand posture analysis moving hand stops posture analyzed elastic graph matching :10.1.1.37.9020
different hand postures represented attributed graphs nodes carry local image information form responses gabor wavelets edges graph theoretical sense contain geometrical information 
previous demonstrated elastic graph matching successfully applied person independent recognition hand postures front complex backgrounds 
system optimized robot application graphs fewer nodes reducing num ber allowed hand postures see table results systems 
higher formance necessary truly reliable control achieved investing longer processing times powerful hardware cially wavelet convolution
