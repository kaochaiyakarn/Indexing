tools quite popular helping rede ne people think wide area network applications 
suited supporting information infrastructure characterized enormous data volume rapid growth user base data diversity 
indicate trends dimensions survey problems trends create current approaches 
suggest promising directions resource discovery research initial results projects carried members internet research task force research group resource discovery directory service 
roots internet conceived primarily means remote login experimentation data communication protocols 
hand users prone disorientation searching paradigm handle change better di erent services connected searching easily interfacing organizations 
current systems gopher employ organization typically location data limited item location searching facilities 
browsing rst paradigm users see server archive located type searching provided 
searching comprehensive archive example wais servers provide full text indexes limited titles 
indexing schemes importance searching seen emergence le system search tools veronica system search facility gopher :10.1.1.17.6054
interesting note model focuses organizing browsing successful application interface archie search system 
support cient searching various means indexing data required 
illustrated internet indexing tools placed spectrum indexing space vs representativeness 
upper left corner gure occupied systems achieve space cient indexes represent names les menus index 
glimpse divides entire le system blocks contrast inverted indexes stores word block numbers containing 
index size typically text size position 
search done rst index blocks match query 
glimpse supports approximate matching regular expression matching options 
examples similar approaches include scatter gather browsing approach alex le system tool veronica :10.1.1.43.1252
essence mit semantic file system selective indexing documents selecting keywords knowledge structure documents indexed 
example essence understands structure common word processing systems common le types unix environments uses understanding extract authors titles abstracts text documents 
way able select fewer keywords index retain keywords users locate documents 
types systems exploit knowledge structure documents indexed possible include document structure information index
