extended single site dbmss manage relations distributed sites computer network 
various techniques developed handling distributed query optimization distributed transactions 
commercial systems techniques available relational dbms vendors 
distributed dbms assumes share architecture supports basic distributed processing model moving query data 
systems allocate data sites computer network data allocation managed database administrator 
distinct feature distributed database systems dedicated central site keeps schema database including fragmentation location information 
site coordinates processing queries coming users 
due critical role communication parameter traditional distributed query processing cost semijoin operator introduced reduce communication cost inter site joins :10.1.1.33.2276
