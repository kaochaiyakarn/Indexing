describe computing power wearables provide spatialized graphics audio cues aid communication 
result wearable augmented reality communication space audio enabled avatars remote collaborators surrounding user 
user natural head motions attend remote collaborators communicate freely aware side conversations move communication space 
way conferencing space support dozens simultaneous users 
informal user studies suggest wearable communication spaces may offer advantages increase amount information possible access naturalness interface 
sellen summarizes reporting main effect collaborative performance due collaboration mediated type technology mediation 
people generally prefer audio condition able perform tasks effectively audio video condition cases perform worse face face collaboration 
naturally varies somewhat task 
face face interaction better speech cognitive problem solving tasks visual cues important tasks requiring negotiation 
general usefulness video transmitting non verbal cues may video may better show communication availability views shared workspaces :10.1.1.36.7402
users attempt non verbal communication video conferencing environment gestures exaggerated recognized equivalent face gestures 
results fact speech critical medium teleconferencing experiments may thought audio suitable creating shared communication space 
example purely audio system allowed high quality audio conferencing multiple participants flip switch 
month trial audio sufficient usable communication space 
british telecom demonstrated virtual conferencing users represented life virtual avatars virtual rooms 
users freely move space setting viewpoints spatial relationships 
collaborative virtual environments cves spatial visual audio cues combine natural ways aid communication 
known party effect shows people easily monitor spatialized audio streams selectively focusing interest 
simple virtual avatar representation spatial audio model enables users discriminate multiple speakers :10.1.1.37.7741
spatialized interactions particularly valuable governing interactions large groups people enabling crowds people inhabit virtual environment interact way impossible traditional video audio conferencing 
wearable communication space results previous section suggest ideal wearable communications space elements high quality audio communication visual representations collaborators underlying spatial metaphor important aspects creating collaborative communication interface visual audio presentation information 
current wearable computers see see head mounted displays stereo headphones 
displays information combination ways head stabilized information fixed users viewpoint doesn change user changes viewpoint orientation position 
body world stabilized information display attractive number reasons 
demonstrates body stabilized information space overcome resolution limitations head mounted displays 
user wears head mounted display seated rotating chair 
tracking head orientation user experiences information surround effect pixel display 
world stabilized information presentation enables annotation real world context dependent visual audio data creating information enriched environments :10.1.1.53.5151
increases real world tasks 
despite advantages current wearables head stabilized information display 
chosen simplest form body stabilized display uses degree orientation give user impression surrounded virtual cylinder visual auditory information
