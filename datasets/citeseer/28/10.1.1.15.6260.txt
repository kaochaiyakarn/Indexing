control information broadcast enables validation read transactions clients 
propose various methods vary complexity volume control information including transmitting invalidation reports multiple versions item serializability information 
caching client supported decrease query latency 
important backchannel exists client server channel typically small communication capacity 
furthermore number clients supported large great chance overwhelming server clients requests 
addition avoiding contacting server decreases latency client transactions 
proposed methods applicable wired wireless settings 
current research updates treated context caching example :10.1.1.30.6388
case updates considered terms local cache consistency transactional semantics 
transactions broadcast discussed datacycle project special hardware detect changes values read ensure consistency 
datacycle architecture extended case distributed database database site broadcasts contents database fragments residing site 
involves development new correctness criteria transactions broadcast environments deployment broadcast medium transmitting concurrency control related information part transaction management undertaken clients 
clients need listen broadcast continuously 
tune read specific items 
selective tuning important especially case portable mobile computers rely operation finite energy provided batteries listening broadcast consumes energy 
selective tuning clients prior knowledge structure broadcast determine item interest appears channel 
alternatively broadcast self descriptive form directory information broadcast data see instance :10.1.1.21.2963
case client gets information broadcast subsequent reads 
smallest logical unit broadcast called bucket 
buckets analog blocks disks 
bucket header includes useful information 
analogously sgt method cache extended include item transaction wrote information broadcast anyway 
addition time item read cache test cycles item read broadcast performed 

performance evaluation

server periodically broadcasts set data items range 
assume simplicity flat broadcast organization server broadcasts set items 
client accesses items range subset items broadcast 
range access probabilities follow zipf distribution parameter theta model non uniform access 
techniques differ require active clients monitor broadcast continuously 
raising continuous monitoring requirement desirable various settings 
example case mobile clients operation relies finite power provided batteries listening broadcast consumes energy selective tuning required 
access broadcast expensive minimizing access broadcast sought 
client disconnections common data broadcast delivered wirelessly :10.1.1.47.2899
