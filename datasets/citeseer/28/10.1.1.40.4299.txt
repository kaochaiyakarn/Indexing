evolutionary approaches line routing backbone communications networks joshua knowles david corne department computer science university reading uk knowles reading ac uk corne reading ac uk may line routing backbone communications networks important combinatorial optimisation problem 
main uses line routing provides benchmark results dynamic line routing strategies 
second interestingly line routing investigated employed right way quickly finding significantly improved live networks imposed network offer net improvement quality service 
third networks bandwidth may booked advance 
introduce investigate number heuristic techniques applicable routing problem stochastic iterative search 
results indicate heuristics significantly improve search solutions particularly line performance considered
