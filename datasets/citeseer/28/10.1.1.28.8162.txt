indexing distance ecient method knn processing cui yu chin ooi lee tan jagadish department computer science national university singapore department electrical engineering computer science university michigan ecient method called idistance nearest neighbor knn search high dimensional space 
idistance partitions data selects point partition 
data cluster transformed single dimensional space similarity respect point 
allows points indexed tree structure knn search performed onedimensional range search 
choice partition point provides idistance technique degrees freedom techniques 
describe appropriate choices ectively adapt index structure data distribution
