explore prospective indications importance time sensitive document purpose producing better document filtering ranking 
prospective mean importance assessed actions occur 
example news story may assessed retrospectively important events occurred story appeared stock price follow stories

key di culties building information procedures building models importance prioritize information 
ideally obtain user direct statement interests 
cases clear users ectively 
information filtering ranking procedures rely indirect statements interest user provided keyword profiles samples information items importance assessed user relevance feedback methods :10.1.1.104.8304

concentrate prospective indicators 
information important subsequent occurrence directly indirectly associated information 
example consider appearance news story publicly traded stock value quickly 
case study deem news story important significant number subsequent stories appear similar 
second news story deemed important hour appearance stock market return associated story standard deviation normal hourly return
