problem ensuring efficient storage fast retrieval multi version structured documents important popularity xml documents semistructured information web 
traditional document version control systems rcs model documents sequence lines text shortest edit script represent version differences inefficient preserve logical structure original document 
propose new approach structure documents preserved intact sub objects timestamped hierarchically efficient reconstruction current past versions 
technique called usefulness copy control ubcc geared efficient version reconstruction small storage overhead 
analysis experiments illustrate effectiveness approach version control structured documents

popular text version management tool sccs 
appending version differences rcs sccs interleaves editing operations original document source code associates pair timestamps text segment specifying lifespan segment 
actual choice usefulness parameter set application characteristics document evolution available space required retrieval time 
generalizing ubcc multiple concurrent versions far concentrated linear sequences versions exactly document version valid time 
context notation denote sixth version document 
alternatively version number replaced time interval version valid 
software engineering world common tree structured model versions new version stems new branch normally called minor branch original branch called major branch :10.1.1.151.8450
point branches evolve independently 
instance denote third revision minor branch named stemming version major branch 
naturally minor branches stem version case authors start revising parallel 
branch subdivide branches 
compared traditional strategies rcs new strategy improves efficiency version retrieval cost controlled copying 
fact investigated performance ubcc alternative techniques storing versions including extensions persistent list method tree method temporal databases 
comparison shows ubcc method performs better approaches terms storage retrieval efficiency 
furthermore shown ubcc method provides flexible platform supporting various kinds document queries computations including concurrent versioning index document structure 
ap proaches rcs page list multiversion methods discussed provide flexibility :10.1.1.151.8450
currently investigating related issues including querying restructuring versioned documents efficient generation browser output transport internet versioned documents 
include automatic generation dtds versioned documents dtd document
