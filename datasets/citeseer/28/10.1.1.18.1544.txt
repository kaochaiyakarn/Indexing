bounded explanation inductive refinement acquiring control knowledge daniel borrajo manuela veloso school computer science carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa cs cmu edu approach learning control knowledge problem solving trace consists generating explanations local decisions search process 
explanations control rules situations prune search space 
strong deductive approaches invest substantial explanation effort produce correct control rules single problem solving trace 
alternatively inductive approaches acquire incrementally correct learned knowledge observing large set problem solving examples 
advocate learning method deductive inductive strategies combined efficiently learn control knowledge 
approach consists bounding explanation predetermined set problem solving features
