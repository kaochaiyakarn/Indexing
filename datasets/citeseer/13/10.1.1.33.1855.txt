statistical approaches fall number categories boolean extended boolean vector space probabilistic 
statistical approaches break documents queries terms

classical boolean approach ir boolean case query formulated boolean combination terms 
conventional boolean query uses classical operators 
query satisfied document contains terms similarly query satisfied contains 
query satisfies contains contain complex boolean queries built operators evaluated classical rules boolean algebra 
classical boolean query true false 
correspondingly document satisfies query relevant satisfy non relevant 
ranking possible significant limitation 
harman jasis note stemming employed query condition specifying document contain word retrieve satisfied document contains forms retrieve retrieves retrieved retrieval kinds refinement classical boolean query possible applied ir 
query may applied specified syntactic component document boolean condition may applied title document 
second may specified condition apply specified position syntactic component words title part title 
third additional boolean operator may added classical set proximity operator 
proximity operator specifies close text terms satisfy query condition 
general form proximity operator specifies unit word sentence paragraph integer 
example proximity operator may specify terms occur document words may mean words adjacent 
similarly operator may specify terms sentences proximity operator applied boolean conditions simple terms specify sentence satisfying boolean condition adjacent sentence satisfying boolean condition 
page proximity operator may specify order proximity close words order occur 
classical boolean approach term weights 
comes thing uses weights zero term absent term 
classical boolean model viewed crude way expressing phrase thesaurus relationships 
example says terms condition applicable terms form phrase 
proximity operator employed boolean condition say immediately follow text corresponds closely crudely conventional meaning phrase similarly says serve index term relevant documents sense equivalent 
roughly speaking mean assign class thesaurus 
fact systems viewpoint generate expanded boolean conditions automatically set query terms supplied user boolean expression composed oring query term stored synonyms anding clusters anick sigir automatic generation boolean queries logical structure boolean queries greatest virtue serious drawbacks 
non mathematical novice users experience difficulty formulating boolean queries harman jasis misinterpret meaning operators 
particular set intersection set union intended 
ogden kaplan cited ogden led schemes automatic generation boolean queries 
anick sigir salton ip anick approach mentioned query terms presumably stemming removing words ored 
term expanded synonyms online thesaurus 
salton approach contrast imposes boolean structure terms supplied user 
thesaurus employed 
salton starts natural language query 
usual stemming removal words generates set user terms ored anick approach 
salton looks pairs triples user supplied terms occur documents 
user terms occur document chance salton uses formula pairwise correlation determine pair occurring terms occur frequently expected chance 
similar correlation formula occurring triples user supplied words occurring document 
pair triple computed correlation exceeds pre determined threshold grouped boolean pair triple exceed threshold automatically generated boolean query assuming terms page stressed pairs triples drawn entirely terms originally supplied user thesaurus expansion anick query expansion relevance feedback see employed 
combining various techniques certainly feasible 
refinement salton ranks terms single terms pairs triples automatically generated boolean expression descending order inverse document frequency

estimate number documents term pair triple responsible retrieving frequency occurrence documents 
total estimated number documents retrieved boolean query exceeds number documents user wants see reduce estimated number deleting terms query starting lowest idf ranking

new document arrives added growing collection suffix tree updated reflect new suffixes sentences encountered previous document re occurrences suffixes previously encountered earlier documents 
new sentence se current document processed suffix tree updated reflect new suffixes se encountered previous document previous sentence re occurrences suffixes previously encountered earlier documents 
distinct suffix path series edges leading leaf node suffix tree 
leaf node labeled suffix path leads node indexed documents suffix appears 
similarly path internal non leaf node represents prefix string words begins suffixes 
internal node labeled prefix indexed identify documents suffixes occur 
example document may contain suffix quick brown fox jumped lazy dog call suffix 
suffixes sentence corresponding dog lazy dog lazy dog including suffix representing complete sentence 
non leaf internal node represents words prefix suffixes 
implicit prefixes sentence quick quick brown quick brown fox prefixes remain implicit encountered subsequent sentence subsequent document different continuation 
internal node children child representing different continuation parent 
document may contain sentence suffix quick brown fox sleeping encountered implicit prefix node quick brown fox explicit node third document may arrive containing sentence suffix quick dead case internal explicit node created representing prefix quick node children leaf node internal node prefix continuation branching turn children representing suffixes way word sequences representing characterizing collection documents efficiently represented easily updated new documents arrive containing new suffixes new instances existing suffixes 
internal node suffix tree represents prefix set documents containing prefix example internal node representing prefix documents containing 
leaf node represents suffix set documents containing leaf node representing document containing

querying web ir engines web don break new ground relative research engines discussed report 
ir engines provide levels query formulation basic level advanced level may enjoy name power level 
basic level typically set keywords combined logically default boolean words effectively term vectors 
query terms normally words engines webcrawler infoseek altavista support phrases typically enclosing sequence words quotation marks 
engines allow user precede term plus minus 
plus may weak form designated term page 
minus may equivalent designated term page 
lycos uses minus little page differently putting minus front keyword means pages containing term excluded ranked lower list pages returned user 
advanced level usually offers form boolean query operators 
engines support parentheses control order evaluation operators 
proximity operators offered 
example webcrawler offers near adjacent operator 
condition near says terms occur words condition says immediately follows order 
contrast altavista near operator allow user specify degree proximity separation intervening words 
open text followed requires occur specified order need adjacent certain degree proximity altavista user specify degree 
lycos offers interesting enhancement traditional boolean looking different perspective enhanced degree control soft boolean user specify search terms page 
engines support documentation usually doesn tell words list 
engines effectively generate lists statistically ignoring words common web 
engines provide stoplist 
similarly engines infoseek provide stemming stemming algorithms publicly documented provide automatic stemming 
engines provide wildcard character allow user limited stemming 
example altavista supports asterisk word middle preceded characters 
run find run runs running finds labor labour hand lycos provides truncation word run truncation default lycos period specified inhibit truncation 
nature web allows ir engines support certain specialized query conditions 
example hotbot supports querying internet domain domain final component host name url edu domain educational institutions universities com domain commercial organizations mil domain military organizations 
note entire internet address host computer called domain name components called sub domains righthand component called top level sub domain 
old domain names developed internet largely restricted internet grown international new set character domain codes country developed uk united kingdom ca canada jp japan hotbot allows user restrict search organizational domain edu restricts search hosts belonging educational institutions country jp restricts search japanese hosts geographical region europe restrict search domain codes corresponding countries europe 
hotbot supports query condition restricting search pages containing urls pointing files media type 
convention media type file specified suffix called extension example filename html formatted page extension html htm name image file graphics interchange format extension gif hotbot user restrict search page pages containing urls gif returned 
remember url address consists hostname followed pathname pathname consists series directory sub directory names terminating actual filename extension suffix filename 
altavista takes advantage html format conventional web page support query conditions field 
example user specify search page word phrase boolean combination restricted title body text user sees url page url page host name url page link page pointing specified kind file java applet image file similarly infoseek allows user restrict term search page title urls links body page 
infoseek url search returns pages urls contain specified term 
infoseek user specify site search means search retrieves pages contain term hostname respective urls 
feature retrieve pages site pages available host 
retrieve pages number hosts having specified component common 
open text supports searches title url similar infoseek url search heading restricts search html component tagged heading yahoo 
indexes pages elaborate hierarchy human generated subject categories natural way user generate query yahoo 
traverse subject category index general specific category finds narrow category best categorizes subject interested

hand robot engines infoseek lycos webcrawler provide limited human generated hierarchical subject category index 
case lycos index limited popular sites popularity measured number links sites exceeding threshold 
webcrawler index provides reviews sites human operators judged best net general user wants browse subject category better yahoo far extensive organized subject index 
web ir engines compute score similarity indexed web pages relative query 
indexing web engines usually don document similarity ranking algorithms 
clear desirable point major engines rank page results 
large number results may return ranking necessity 
research systems described report ranking usually far perfect 
generally speaking engines rank pages expect number hits simple set keywords highest ranking pages tend contain largest number specified terms largest number occurrences search terms 
generally highest ranking pages tend satisfy specified search conditions 
engines webcrawler infoseek give higher weight terms common web 
weight query terms search terms highly significant position page lycos infoseek weight terms highly appear title altavista infoseek weight terms heavily occur near page hotbot gives higher weights terms title meta components lycos weighs search terms heavily close proximity 
engines infoseek altavista hotbot weight terms heavily frequency occurrence 
hotbot bases weighting normalized term frequency term frequency count short page long page 
engines allow user weight query term explicitly excite allows user attach weight query term specifying weight number gates repeating term gates gates gates infoseek weights heavily terms appear earlier query user weight query terms implicitly assign relative numeric weights 
excite claims lsi 
query similarity algorithm differ essential respect engines 
compute concept similarity word phrase similarity 
words pages ranked degree similarity statistically derived concepts indexed statistically derived concepts computed user query 
ordinary term weights remain significant significance effect statistical derivation concepts 
number engines assign relevance score ranking 
noted earlier relevance scores generally absolute independent meaning user probabilities relevance web engines claim computing probability 
typically engines assign scores range 
infoseek appears claim relevance scores computed objective standard 
means relevance score highest ranking page search compared corresponding score search 
highest score search highest score search highest ranking page second search lot relevant highest ranking page search 
best score search may far 
infoseek tell user best score relevant query 
contrast engines compute scores compare pages retrieved search pages matching query 
highest score close maximum matter poor query page match 
noted engines provide limited form relevance feedback 
user designate pages retrieved previous search satisfying needs especially ask pages designated 
engine retrieves pages similar possible 
excite calls feature query example open text page call corresponding feature find similar pages engines compute similarity query page similarity differently 
open text identifies frequently occurring words designated page looks index pages containing words especially pages contain title heading components 
excite uses lsi map designated page lsi concepts searches index pages associated concepts 
noted earlier pages may concepts differ words contain provided contain words associated statistically shared concepts 
meta querying web previous sections illustrated web ir engines vary enormously traverse web discover urls frequently update list discovered urls index pages urls point harvest discovered pages update index kinds queries allow user formulate interpret user queries compute similarity user query pages indexed order rank pages retrieve presentation user 
web changes grows rapidly 
engine possibly index web completely 
engines vary enormously parts proportion web cover deeply cover part web easily permit user formulate query expresses needs retrieving relevant pages ranking pages degree relevance clear kinds query user best searching engine

metacrawler selberg etzioni www journal etzioni aaai example meta engine

possibilities metacrawler approximate phrase boolean terms comprising phrase 
metacrawler return retrieved pages satisfied mere ranked lower satisfied strict phrase query test retrieved pages strict phrase condition post retrieval processing

third possibility restrict scope exact phrase queries engines support 
alternative expensive post processing time hand alternative reduces metacrawler coverage attractive features 
time writing commercial metacrawler said avoid consideration 
web coverage broader provided single ir engine 
reasons 
noted earlier engine hope cover entire web simply large grows fast 
different engines different algorithms traversing web discovering urls 
vary number robots employ degree parallelism robots frequency web traversed update purposes follows substantial variation urls engine discovered indexed date url discovery harvesting second ir engines vary substantially harvest pages urls discovered descriptors extract page put respective indexes 
third vary substantially compute query page similarity relevance rank retrieved pages presentation user 
reason means different engines may applying query sets urls partially overlap urls may unique index engine
