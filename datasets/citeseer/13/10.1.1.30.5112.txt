term spoken dialogue system di erent meanings di erent people generally implies interactive system operates constrained domain 
main ways systems di er degree system takes active role conversation 
systems dialogue tend ask user series questions ivr system interact user 
directed queries departure city result shorter responses user result higher success rates 
deployed systems successfully strategy 
framework enhanced allowing knowledgeable experienced users specify multiple constraints single utterance 
alternative approach dialogue employ mixed initiative strategy system exible handling constraints user typically process complex linguistic inputs 
systems usually attempt jointly negotiate user help determine set constraints particular task 
allowing user exibility systems higher error rates confusing users unfamiliar technology 
order reduce severity problem systems deploy hybrid approach backing constraining dialogue system detects having problems understanding user 
minimum spoken dialogue system requires automatic speech recognizer asr perform speech text conversion form dialogue manager controller control interaction user mechanism conveying information user text speech generation 
complex systems generally incorporate modules asr natural language understanding nlu language generation speech synthesis mechanism handling local discourse phenomena addition dialogue manager

dialogue design creating spoken dialogue system basic design decisions structure dialogue manager 
section discusses issues considered design process 

studying human conversations open question designers model human machine dialogue observed human human communication 
study human human dialogue active area research large corpora collected analyzed 
human conversations contain large numbers phenomena dis uencies interruptions con anaphora ellipsis 
utterances simply properly understood context occurred knowledge domain 
table shows statistics annotated dialogue acts computed human human conversations movie information domain 
statistics show nearly half customers dialogue turns okay 
show customer queries especially long 
study hours conversation interactions customers agents di erent information tasks user utterances contained fewer words half words 
clear study human human conversations provide valuable insights nature dialogue matter debate human spoken dialogue systems 
ability handle phenomena commonly human conversations ultimately systems nat average dialogue consisted turns customer agent 
ural easy humans potential things complex confusing 
part reason great diversity dialogue strategies deployed di erent systems 

modeling dialogue phenomena human dialogue phenomena successfully modeled systems 
systems deal spontaneous speech artifacts lled pauses partial words especially allow users exibility expressing queries 
systems natural language capability deal discourse phenomena anaphora ellipsis capable processing ungrammatical queries common spontaneous speech 
systems able handle interruptions allowing user barge system output 
addition problem reliably able detect barge quickly degrade human machine conversation done properly necessary properly update dialogue status re ect fact barge occurred 
system take account interruption occurred response 
example system reading list system need remember interruption occurred especially interruption speci ed ll take united ight tell 
researchers study addition back channel communication spoken dialogue responses order interaction natural 
prosodic information fundamental frequency duration appear provide important clues back occur 
intermediate feedback system informative user silence idle music inevitable delays occur dialogue hold look cheapest price ight london 

matching expectations capabilities dicult problems creating spoken dialogue systems accurately conveying system capabilities user 
includes type speech input processed system domain knowledge system 
expert users familiar subset system capabilities case novices considerable diculty expectations matched system capabilities 
machine directed dialogues tend avoid problems altogether leading user series questions typically produce short answer 
systems take advantage fact users familiar ivr systems mental model system input output behavior 
true mixed initiative dialogue systems provide freedom user 
users understand scope domain 
example jupiter system knows shortterm weather forecasts users ask wide variety legitimate weather questions average rainfall january high tide tomorrow outside system capabilities ask wide variety queries slightly di erent issue 
order assist users stay capabilities domain form help capability required 
designing help capabilities easy task 
users know ask help identifying help requests spoken language understanding task 
addition user may understand help sorry didn understand please rephrase query especially understand system working rst place 
experience people tend mimic example suggestions 
example observed article appears jupiter system sample dialogue people call try exact dialogue 
clearly power suggestion applies spoken dialogue systems 
addition knowing domain knowledge system user necessarily know range knowledge domain 
example jupiter know cities united states necessary able detect user asking vocabulary city help inform user cities system knows listing possibilities 
jupiter currently hierarchical geography table tries help user narrow question speci city knows 
user knows full range capabilities system may know type questions system able understand 
observed di erent speaking styles data range isolated words san francisco speaking temperature boston extremely chatty hi jupiter vacation hawaii week 

recovering errors challenging area research recovering inevitable mis understandings system 
errors due di erent phenomena acoustics speaking style dis uencies outof vocabulary words parse coverage understanding gaps dicult gure problem determine problem caused convey appropriate response user problem 
systems incorporate form con dence scoring try identify problematic inputs 
system try alternative strategy help user back directed dialogue requires explicit con rmation 
statistics jupiter utterance rejected highly utterance rejected 
appears certain users unfortunate tendency go rejection death spiral hard get 
precise feedback system type error possible solutions help situation 
con dence scoring perform partial understanding allows re ned corrective dialogue requesting re input uncertain areas 
partial understanding may help identifying outof vocabulary words 

integrating multiple modalities spoken dialogue systems behave quite di erently depending input output modalities available user 
environments telephone necessary tailor dialogue overwhelm user information 
displays available may desirable simply summarize information user show table image similarly nature interaction change alternative input modalities pen gesture available user 
modality effective depend things environment classroom user preference dialogue state 

implementation strategies ways dialogue managers implemented described 
systems type scripting language general mechanism describe dialogue ow 
systems represent dialogue ow graph dialogue objects modules 
aspect system implementation active vocabulary understanding capabilities change depending state dialogue 
systems structured user ask question point dialogue entire vocabulary active times 
systems restrict vocabulary language accepted particular points dialogue 
trade generally increased user exibility reacting system response query increased accuracy due constraints user input 
current dialogue systems design dialogue strategy typically hand crafted system developer 
time consuming process especially mixed initiative dialogues result may may generalize di erent domains 
research exploring machine learning techniques automatically determine dialogue strategy 

spoken language technologies addition problem creating dialogue manager researchers faced challenges spoken language technologies 
aside constraint real time performance applies system ensemble interesting research challenges individual component technologies 
section describe research issues detail 

speech recognition issues speech recognition context spoken dialogue asr research areas 
addition challenges associated spontaneous speech artifacts mentioned previously problems spoken dialogue systems listed 

channel conditions acoustic input conditions naturally depend setup particular dialogue system 
years systems moved noise canceling microphones telephones possibly microphone arrays 
telephones provide access wider audience provide challenging acoustic environment due narrower channel bandwidths weaker levels greater variety handset characteristics 
cellular phones provide greater challenge due added noise levels dropout artifacts 

speaker variation systems publicly available general data collection started observe wider variety dialects non native accents previously able collect 
diculty data varied widely depending strength accent challenge speaker independent recognition technology 
type speech seen large quantities data children 
speakers considerably harder system trained large amounts data previously telephone channel bandwidths eliminated signi cant portion speech 
despite higher error rates children technology patient system tended just repeat query verbatim rephrasing 

adaptation adaptation widely improve performance individual speakers 
traditional adaptation techniques require lot data suited domains small number queries user identi cation mechanism 
short term adaptation important areas 
applications user identity known able form user pro le including acoustic phonetic characteristics pronunciation vocabulary language possibly domain preferences user lives boston prefers seat 

adding new words unconstrained input situations vocabulary speci ed user users free words unknown system 
systems jupiter recognize possible cities world users try help system spelling word said bangor emphasizing syllables word usually poor consequences 
addition detecting presence vocabulary words useful able add new words especially content words dynamically augment system capabilities 

language understanding dialogue system gets isolated word inputs necessary capability process word sequences appropriately system 
large variety methods explored area linguistic constraints modelled integrated search 
systems drive recognizer formal grammar context free 
systems potential disadvantage overly constraining 
exible frameworks try fully analyze utterance resort keyword phrase spotting methods 
approach highly successful darpa atis program deployed successfully commercial applications 
hybrid approach adopted mit try perform complete analysis utterance back robust parsing complete parse 
cases form stochastic parsing useful provide constraint addition platform understanding 
point clear complete linguistic analysis necessary 
certainly simple domains jupiter quite possible spot keywords phrases 
language gets complex clear simpler approach ective 
area explored extent incorporate automatic learning methods understanding 
methods require annotated corpus time consuming task 
research exploring linguistic constraints incorporated search process 
simplest form integration strategy decouple processes completely asr computes top choice sentence hypothesis passes nlu component subsequent analysis 
currently systems compute set best sentence hypotheses word graph gets processed nlu unit 
researchers explored tightly coupled strategies commonly systems complex grammars due increased computation 
general ongoing research challenge incorporate linguistic constraint early search introducing search errors increasing computation time real time constraints 

language generation utterance understood system necessary convey information user 
systems display satisfactory simply display table information 
experience form linguistic feedback extremely valuable informs user machine understood 
easier detect machine error possibly correct 
linguistic feedback usually terse form summary complements tabular information 
generation aspects far dicult system information user speech 
example speak long list detail overwhelming user details signi cant part generation modelling deciding summarize set items list 
interesting issues deciding convey new vs old information researchers observed precise wording response large impact user response 
general vaguely response result larger variation inputs 
type response desirable depend system research production purposes 
nal objective improve understanding wider variety input general response appropriate 
directed response improve performance short term 
language generation spoken dialogue systems tends static constant response pattern users 
observed introducing variation way prompt users additional queries know 
help quite ective making system appear robotic natural users 
interesting see stochastic language generation capability received users 
addition ability vary prosody output apply contrastive stress certain words important reducing monotony speech responses 
philosophical question language generation system responses users 
naturally varied opinions matter 
situations ective response commonly interaction sorry 
certainly users bothered cation evident deployed systems 

speech synthesis depending nature feedback systems form speech synthesis user especially telephone systems 
type syn thesis varies widely pre recorded phrases word phrase concatenation general purpose synthesizers 
general synthesis method general purpose naturalness degrades 
interesting observe speech synthesis component leaves lasting impression users especially especially natural 
natural sounding speech synthesis important research topic spoken dialogue systems 

prosody prosody impacts speech understanding speech generation widely incorporated text speech systems 
attempts prosodic information recognition understanding hopeful research appear area 
project researchers able show considerable improvement processing speed integrating prosodic information search component recognition 

development issues developing spoken dialogue systems classic chicken egg problem 
order develop system capabilities needs large corpus data system re nement evaluation 
order collect data re ects actual usage needs system users speak 
typically developers create initial system small corpus data wizard oz data collection method system loop mechanism iteratively re ne evaluate system components 

data collection things evolved considerably decade means scale data collection system development evaluation 
true speech recognition speech understanding communities seen systems arise project 
mit example voyager system developed recruiting subjects come laboratory ask series questions initial wizard system 
contrast data collection procedure jupiter consists deploying publicly available system recording interactions 
large di erences number queries number users range issues data provide 
system loop form data collection system development evaluation iterative procedures 
unsupervised methods augment system asr nlu capabilities continuous 
making systems widely available real users helped systems considerably robust provided wealth data research spoken dialogue systems 
order get users system needs providing real information user 
little incentive people system play solve toy problem scenarios may may re ect problems real users 

evaluation issues faces developers spoken dialogue systems evaluate progress order determine created usable system 
developers decide metrics evaluate systems ensure progress 
metrics include component evaluations assess performance system 
systems conduct transaction possible tell user completed task 
cases possible measure accompanying statistics length time complete task number turns noted statistics may important user satisfaction 
example spoken dialogue interface may take longer alternative users may prefer due factors stressful hands free 
better form evaluation measure users liked system called perform real task browsing recommend 
component evaluations asr nlu fairly common common generation synthesis amenable automatic evaluation methods necessary decide correct answer 
asr evaluation usually straightforward range phenomena necessarily obvious evaluate cross talk partial words 
nlu evaluation performed comparing form meaning representation 
problem nlu understanding common meaning representation di erent research sites cross site comparison dicult 
darpa atis program example participants ultimately agree comparing answer coming common database 
unfortunately necessarily led creation large document de ning principals interpretation conceivable queries 
order keep response systems consistent systems restricted initiative major constraint dialogue research 
way show progress particular system perform longitudinal evaluations recognition understanding 
case jupiter continually evaluate standard test sets rede ne periodically order keep tuning particular data set 
data continually arrive dicult create new sets re evaluate older system releases new data 
systems dialogue context provide constraint recognition example favoring candidate hypotheses mention date system just asked date 
reprocessing utterances order assess improvements recognition understanding performance time need able take advantage dialogue context original dialogue user 
dialogue context recorded time data collection re utilized subsequent line processing order avoid giving original system unwarranted advantage 

portability creating robust mixed initiative dialogue system require tremendous amount ort part researchers 
order technology ultimately successful easier port existing technology new domains languages 
time researchers technology modular 
example original voyager system discourse language generation components completely intertwined domain back 
time taken language generation discourse back order domain independent easier port new domains 
date dialogue manager domain dependent ongoing challenge component domain independent 
past years di erent research groups attempting easier non experts create new domains 
systems modularize dialogue manager try take advantage fact dialogue broken smaller set sub dialogues dates addresses order easier construct dialogue new domain 
example researchers ogi developed rapid development kits creating spoken dialogue systems freely available students create systems 
research needed area try systems complex dialogue strategies generalize di erent domains 

research spoken dialogue systems increasing steadily decade due growing interest demand human machine interaction 
spoken dialogue systems successfully deployed cases commercial applications tend data collected real users system development evaluation 
wide range dialogue strategies employed systems ranging tightly controlled machine directed dialogue exible complex mixed initiative dialogue 
despite increasing success remain number needed spoken language technologies necessary improved interaction users 
remains done generalize knowledge gained experience domain
