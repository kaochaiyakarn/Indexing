discussion experience gained implementing editor allows draw editing formatting tools structured documents ffl style properties need closely associated logical structure specifically structural contextual dependencies required 
ffl order format elements placement depends logical structure physical structure cooperation editing process formatting process necessary 
ffl interactive editor formatter crucial need traversing document elements logical structure physical areas reverse direction physical area screen find structure elements corresponds 
picture data structure maintains bidirectional links tree concrete picture 
analyse implementation light standards clear approach closer dsssl oda mainly content architecture defined oda prevents integrated formatting 
architecture defined dsssl proposes step process transformation process formatting process 
implementation decomposed formatting steps 
clearly comes necessity deal step presentation operations depend logical structure second step operations depend layout structure 
precisely decomposition involves processes 
transformation process transforms document called source instance dsssl vocabulary applying style rules adding presentation boxes computing information relevant structure duplicating suppressing information 
result tree called output instance dsssl called picture 

formatting process produces formatted document result instance dsssl instantiating physical areas area templates dsssl pouring output instance areas respect flowing model 
implementation operation performed hooking instantiated area subtree output instance fills 
analysis implementation viewed experience conforms dsssl architecture 
main question dsssl architecture interactive structured edition formatting lack cooperation processes 
question ability express structurally dependent properties presentation properties appear area definition rely physical structure
