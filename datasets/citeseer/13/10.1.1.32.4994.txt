probabilistic relational models probabilistic relational model prm specifies template probability distribution database 
template includes relational component describes relational schema domain probabilistic component describes probabilistic dependencies hold domain 
prm particular database objects relations defines probability distribution attributes objects relations 
relational schema schema relational model describes set classes xn class associated set descriptive attributes set slots set descriptive attributes class denoted 
attribute class denoted domain values denoted 
assume domains finite 
example person class descriptive attributes sex age height domain person age young adult middle aged 
set slots class denoted 
similar notation denote slot slot typed schema specifies range type object may referenced 
formally domain type dom range type range class slot denotes function dom range example class movie slot actor range class actor 
class person slots father mother range type person class 
certain cases want explicitly specify domain class particular slot notation actor role slot define inverse slot interpreted inverse function 
define notion slot chain allows compose slots defining functions objects note direct mapping notion class tables relational database 
descriptive attributes correspond standard attributes table slots correspond attributes foreign keys key attributes table 
objects directly related 
precisely define slot chain sequence slots inverse range dom 
example person mother mother denote person maternal grandmother person actor role denote set roles actor 
useful distinguish entity relationship entity relationship diagrams 
language classes represent entities relationships 
entities actors movies represented classes relationship role relates actors movies represented class slots class actor class movie 
approach blurs distinction entities relationships common allows accommodate descriptive attributes associated relation role type describe type role villain extra 
denote set classes represent entities xr denote represent relationships 
note distinctions prior knowledge domain part domain specification 
generic term object refer entities relationships 
semantics language straightforward 
instantiation associated set objects 
attribute specifies value 
slot specifies value range 
range denote set entities fx yg 
semantics slot chain defined straightforward composition 
range define multiset values set instantiation set objects missing values dangling

discussed goal construct probabilistic models instantiations 
shall consider various classes probabilistic models vary amount prior specification model 
specification form skeleton domain defines set possible instantiations 
model defines probability distribution set 
define necessary building blocks describe sets possible instantiations 
entity skeleton specifies set entities class possible instantiations actor name gender fred male female bing male movie name genre drama comedy role role movie actor role type fred hero bing villain bing hero love interest instantiation relational schema simple movie domain 
class example associated entity skeleton specify set movies actors database actor movie fm 
object skeleton richer structure specifies set objects class example object skeleton consistent specify information entity skeleton fact role fr 
note information tells unique identifier key different objects relate 
effect entity object skeletons told cardinality various classes 
relational skeleton contains substantially information 
specifies set objects classes relationships hold 
words specifies object specifies values slots

probabilistic model attributes probabilistic relational model specifies probability distributions instantiations relational schema

parent form possibly empty slot chain understand semantics dependence recall multiset values 
notion aggregation database theory define dependence multiset depend probabilistically aggregate property 
natural useful notions aggregation simplify presentation focusing particular notions aggregation median ordinal attributes mode common value

structural uncertainty model described previous section relations attributes determined relational skeleton descriptive attributes uncertain 
eq 
determines likelihood attributes objects capture likelihood relations objects 
section extend probabilistic model allow structural uncertainty 
scenario treat relational structural fixed 
treat relations objects uncertain aspect domain 
describe probability distribution different relational structures 
describe different dependency models represent structural uncertainty uncertainty existence uncertainty 
useful different contexts note models exhaust space possible models 
uncertainty model assume objects prespecified relations slot chains subject random choices 
precisely object skeleton specifies objects class 
need specify probabilistic model descriptive attributes value slots 
domain slot set keys unique identifiers objects class range 
need specify probability distribution set objects class 
naive approach simply prm specify probability distribution directly multinomial distribution 
approach major flaws 
obviously multinomial large parameter object importantly want dependency model general apply possible object skeletons distribution defined terms objects specific object skeleton apply 
achieve representation general compact follows 
roughly speaking partition class subsets values attributes 
example partition class movie genre 
assume value chosen selecting partition selecting object partition uniformly 
example assume movie theater selects genre movie wants show possible bias depending example type theater selects uniformly movies selected genre 
formalize intuition defining slot set partition attributes 
example 
essentially specify distribution value falls partition versus 
accomplish framework current model introducing new attribute called selector attribute takes values space possible instantiations 
possible value determines subset value referent selected 
precisely value defines subset set objects attributes take values 
represent resulting partition 
represent probabilistic model values specifying objects subset partition versus 
example movie theater may show action film documentary film 
accomplish introducing probabilistic model selector attribute model attribute set parents cpd 
cpd specify probability distribution possible instantiations descriptive attributes want allow distribution slot depend aspects domain 
example independent movie theater may show foreign movies may show action films 
accomplish effect having parents example cpd theater current movie parent theater type 
choice value determines partition value chosen discussed assume choice value uniform distributed set 
definition probabilistic relational model uncertainty components definition 
addition slot range set attributes new selector attribute takes values cross product space set parents cpd new selector attribute usual 
define semantics extension define probability slots descriptive attributes pa pa jy random variable takes values joint assignments 
current treat variable multinomial random variable cross product space 
general represent distribution compactly bayesian network 
example genre movies shown movie theater depend type 
language movie depend location theater 
partition defined genre movie parents theater type theater location 
represent conditional distribution compactly introducing separate variable movie genre parent theater type movie language parent theater location 
take refer instantiation attributes object instantiation note term eq 
depends ways interpretation values attributes object size model gives rise fairly complex dependencies 
consider dependency note depend range depending choice value 
domain dependency graph large number edges 
second note parent ancestor value determine object referenced object turn affects value guarantee complex dependency graph acyclic object skeleton 
accomplish goal extending definition class dependency graph 
graph node descriptive selector attribute graph contains edges descriptive selector attribute parents introduce edge range 
descriptive selector attribute parents add edges slot chain introduce edge dom 
slot range add edge represents dependence attributes partition range 
class edges definition identical definition dependency graph extended deal selector descriptive attributes 
edges second type reflect fact specific value parent node depends values slots chain 
third type edges represent dependency slot attributes associated partition 
see required observe choice value depends values partition attributes different objects attributes determined determined 
show dependency graph stratified defines coherent probabilistic model 
theorem prm relational uncertainty stratified dependency graph 
object skeleton 
prm uniquely define probability distribution instantiations extend eq 

existence uncertainty uncertainty model previous section assumes number objects known 
consider division objects entities relations number objects classes types fixed 
need describe possible ways relating movies actors roles 
predetermined number roles bit artificial domains puts artificial constraint relationships movies actors 
movie big production involves actors reduces number roles movies 
section consider models number relationship objects fixed advance 
example consider possible roles determine exists instantiation 
case schema entity skeleton set objects associated relationship classes 
call entity classes determined undetermined 
note relationship classes typically represent relationships slots refer determined classes 
example role class slots actor person movie movie 
know set actors set movies may uncertain actors role movie uncertainty existence role objects 
basic approach model allow objects existence uncertain 
objects undetermined classes 
way achieving effect introducing model entities potentially exist associate special binary variable tells entity exists 
note construction purely conceptual explicitly construct model containing non existent objects 
example domain role class instantiation person movie 
potential object role ym domain associated binary attribute specifies person see movie ym definition define undetermined class follows 
set slots range 
instantiation require 

denote corresponding object special existence attribute values ftrue falseg 
uniformity notation introduce attribute classes classes determined value defined true 
require slots determined class range type determined class 
existence attribute undetermined class treated way descriptive attribute dependency model parents children associated cpd 
note real life applications models compute conditional probabilities 
cases compute probability partial skeleton determines attributes domain queries conditional probability remaining aspects instance 
situation fixing number objects artificial 
somewhat surprisingly definitions semantics model change 
precisely defining existence events attributes incorporating appropriately probabilistic model set things semantics eq 
applies unchanged 
course place restrictions model ensure definitions lead coherent probability model 
problem arise range type slot undetermined class refers range case set defined circularly terms 
ensure semantic coherence impose restrictions models undetermined class 
attribute ancestor addition object exist objects refers exist slot false false 
require dependencies pass objects exist 
slot range type define usable slot follows define fx trueg 
allow defining parent slot chains dependency model easy capture requirements class dependency graph 
slot range type edge attribute pa edge range require attribute dependency graph stratified 
turns requirements sufficient guarantee entity set undetermined entity type defined allow extended language viewed standard prm 
follows easily extended prm defines coherent probability distribution theorem prm undetermined classes stratified class dependency graph 
entity skeleton 
prm uniquely define relational skeleton classes probability distribution instantiations extends eq 

note full instantiation determines existence attributes undetermined classes 
probability distribution induced prm specifies probability certain entity exist model 
note real world databases specify descriptive attributes entities exist
