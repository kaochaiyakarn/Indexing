publish appeared minor footnotes public key cryptology 
occasionally cited asked write permanent record 
forward security digital signatures rump session eurocrypt introduced idea forward secure digital signature elaborated passing invited talk conference year 
concept developed researchers 
basic idea adam back floated idea public key cryptosystem series public keys pi secret keys si stand usual relationship updating functions fi gi pi fi pi si gi si 
way single root public key certified key owner regularly calculate si destroy si 
way compromise private key expose traffic encrypted key previous epochs 
proposed obvious extension digital signatures order prevent retrospective forgery messages signed keys belonging earlier epochs requiring public key infrastructure accommodate large numbers time limited public keys 
motivation note diffie hellman key exchange provide forward security easily interactive communication defense messaging system dms apparently uses transient public keys provide forward security offline messaging alice wishes communicate bob fetches directory server public key signed long term private key 
dms described kea key agreement algorithm uses 
possible provide functionality having commit particular directory access infrastructure 
forward secure signature forward secure signature method suggested eurocrypt acm starts fiat shamir scheme 
basic idea signature sig produced combinatorial product number secrets roots public verification values vi 
simplest form simply multiplies secrets values th bit hash message signed 
sig hi secret values example key owner name hashed integers order provide signature scheme identity public key user name 
fiat shamir variant trapdoor way function maps vi squaring modulo product large random primes provide provable security random multiplier secret values indefinitely 
signature sig mod hi proposal different features working large secret vector public vector vi destroy factors modulus erase signature care needed detailed implementation prevent reconstructed signatures gaussian elimination scope skilled art 
forward secure encryption general observation followed identity public key cryptosystem digital signature scheme adapted provide forward secure system 
trick key owner plays role ca scheme generates private keys corresponding identities dates required 
example get forward secure encryption obvious adaptation maurer yacobi scheme employs diffie hellman key exchange composite modulus factors known ca respect compute discrete logs obtain private keys corresponding public keys 
pointed id signature schemes signature schemes terms usual legal definition electronic signature imposes requirement signer maintain means signature creation sole control 
forward security real application technology 
forward versus backward security comment protection provided schemes forward security backward security 
terms controversial see rfc 
people term forward security loosely mean design property compromise current key limited effect diffie hellman 
distinction drawn backward forward security 
backward security may taken mean compromise key necessarily expose old traffic 
traditional systems provided key updating principals share key pass way hash function agreed times ki ki 
forward security may taken mean compromise key necessarily expose traffic 
advent public key cryptography achieved regular rekeying cases inwhich principals share key hash agreed times messages exchanged key change ki mi mi 
point attacker compromises systems steals key soon exchange message doesn observe guess security recovered 
fragile general easy lose synchronization variant theme terminals australia 
diffie hellman allows stronger form forward security soon compromised terminal exchanges message uncompromised security recovered traffic monitored opponent 
believe distinction sensible definitions mechanisms described mainly provide backward security 
circumstances provide forward security suitable surrounding protocols 
simplest way case encryption keep key material offline storage 
possible store private keys si terminology keys formed hash chains running appropriate direction 
example keys si stored encrypted keys ki kj kj kj discarded 
compromise ki exposing keys forward security 
key escrow bigger issue 
remarked private keys stored escrow agent keys ej ej ej 
way escrow agent give law enforcement agency keys back traffic compromising keys 
provides forward security sort 
uk question moot crypto legislation allows users revoke public keys corresponding private keys law enforcement agencies 
compatible weak keys programs support microsoft crypto api capi embedded windows verify programs embedded public signature verification keys 
requirement defeat mechanisms circumvent export control control functions 
naive approach find public key replace 
problem existing modules re signed new key system may accepting genuine software downloaded software upgrades problematic companies bought product substituted embedded key 
problem arose context cambridge needed defeat capi order products microsoft operating systems 
problem people leave keys places adequately protected 
example people leave pgp keys web pages 
appears implicit assumption key replaced attacker detected quickly ciphertexts received decrypted 
observations inspired 
public key corresponding private key public key messages decipher verify signatures weak key private key decipher messages create signatures verify 
easy create compatible weak key rsa encryption 
genuine public key replaced example public nn attacker knows factors provides compatible weak key rsa encryption systems 
example provides exploit large prime variant rsa session key padded zeros significant bits am told proprietary system 
happens provide exploit pgp version software truncates received key packet number bits declared user private key 
similarly possible attack elgamal encryption basic idea force operation smooth subgroup 
encryption key mod replaced qr smooth 
pgp random padding key packet plaintext understand introduced low exponent attacks rsa kept pgp version legacy code 
new attack public key cryptosystems 
fails provide exploits widely fielded applications matter chance design 
aware compatible weak key attacks signature schemes general case 
capi attack completely different documented 
understand necessary exploit
