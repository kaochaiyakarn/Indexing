common obvious approach tackle problem information filtering contentbased filtering 
keyword filtering latent semantic indexing example content filtering techniques 
content filtering techniques recommend items user consumption correlations content items user preferences 
example system may try correlate presence keywords article user taste 
content filtering limitations ffl items machine parsable form text attributes assigned items hand 
current technology media sound photographs art video physical items analyzed automatically relevant attribute information 
practical possible assign attributes hand due limitations resources 
ffl content filtering techniques inherent method generating serendipitous finds

presents social informa tion filtering general approach personalized information filtering 
social information filtering essentially automates process word mouth recommendations items recommended user values assigned people similar taste 
system determines users similar taste standard formulas computing statistical correlations 
social information filtering overcomes limitations content filtering
