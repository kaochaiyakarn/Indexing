hearer may able determine speaker trying hearer knows world knows speaker believes world 
alternatively hearer may able speaker believes world recognizing speaker trying discourse

graph traversal produces texts structure mirrors structure domain knowledge representations traversed schema approaches domain independent rhetorical strategies select information impose structure text 
approaches incorporate focus considerations determine say options available 
graph traversal paraphrasing knowledge base studying naturally occurring texts various types computational linguists identified types text text structure closely follows conceptual relations causal temporal spatial connecting domain entities described paris sibun suthers
