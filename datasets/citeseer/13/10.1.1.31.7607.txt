discusses potential rewards pitfalls await designers wishing incorporate context awareness schilit brown interactive systems 
issues described anecdotal form experiences developing evaluating context aware guide system cheverst cheverst 
introduce issues arise concerning context awareness consider popular interactive system car specifically braking system 
anti locking braking system abs context aware system introduced safety measure order reduce braking distance greatly reduce potential driver causing car excessive braking 
context sensed braking system includes driver currently trying brake situated context ii wheel currently locked braking environmental context 
adaptive element system involves detecting wheel locked decreasing braking force wheel longer locked 
point braking force applied provided situated context braking 
advent abs drivers required develop mental models took account complex interrelationship exists braking force friction car road 
number accidents year involving cars illustrates fact drivers aforementioned relationship 
consideration abs system allows identify agent acting behalf driver reduces mental physical demands driving car 
effect agent takes control power away driver providing driver prefers interaction car car easier drive 
abs system enables driver form simplified mental model regarding cars braking system drivers don need detailed comprehension rules governing excessive braking force resultant lack control 
car driver conventional manual braking mechanism learnt skill pumping brakes order prevent car 
unfortunately skill employed driver car abs approaches conflict causing braking distance increased 
example highlights potential pitfalls arise adapting context problem failing reach stable state thimbleby 
user system attempt adapt current context system manage reach stable state 
circumstances system appear unpredictable 
designing context aware systems clearly important consider ii background expertise user formed mental model interacting similar non adaptive system 
trade prescription freedom 
driver wanted reason lock wheels car system prevent achieving task 
iii user trust agent performing adaptation behalf 
abs introduced altogether surprisingly mistrust system drivers 
driver knows workings abs system required trust context sensing technology intelligence agent ability react appropriately context failsafe manner 
possible identify main ways context simplify user interaction interactive system simplifying reducing task specification required user order achieve desired goals reducing need input action user 
level simply mean filling required blank user current location information sensed system 
higher level involve attempting pre user current goal order reduce task specification abs system 
ii changing output produced system reducing quantity information processed user increasing quality information 
reduction output achievable attempting preempt output required expected user current context 
iii reducing complexity rules constituting user mental model system 
generally achieved form intelligent agent performs proportion required computation user behalf 
section describes analyses positive negative experiences context gained development evaluation guide system 
experiences developing context aware tourist guide guide system developed provide visitors city lancaster information tailored context 
city contains number strategically positioned wireless communication cells diameter approximately depending layout buildings 
communication cells disseminating location information tourist information mobile guide units 
carrying guide unit visitors receive date information city attractions structured tour city tailored specific requirements 
guide key requirements cheverst flexibility 
detail visitors system able change kind situated interaction 
example visitor able change tour booking accommodation resume tour 
reason designed user interface enables user switch different aspects functionality order meet demands current situation 
user interface visitor tour 
initial evaluation compromise reduce flexibility afforded user interface order increase ease 
compromise involved making tour default mode situated interaction tour completed aborted 
order describe way guide adapts context categories identified simplifying reducing task specification 
type context utilized guide visitor location location attractions city 
system reduces need input assuming information required visitor strongly influenced current location 
example visitor standing outside lancaster castle request system tell area am opposed searching contents page information lancaster castle 
initial guide system mistake allowing visitors obtain information regarding current location determination thimbleby employed system simplify visitors task inappropriate 
lack flexibility version frustrated users system extended enable visitors specify requirements fully searching information keyword 
point clearly illustrates intrinsic problem trying successfully pre goal user 
ii changing output produced system 
general guide system attempts constrain tailor information visitor current context 
example visitor requests list nearby attractions list constrained way attractions open visited placed higher list 
assumption visitor interested attractions open visited 
earlier version system constrained output removing closed attractions list 
frustrated visitors interested visiting attraction anyway view architecture building 
demonstrates difficulty pre user goal 
version system visitor stated interest architecture determine closed attractions clear architectural value included list 
iii reducing complexity user mental model 
guide agent acts behalf user designed relieve user onerous task studying maps guidebooks order devise follow interesting tour 
detail agent calculates tours variety different contexts visitor current location current time special opening hours attractions relative positioning attractions city preferences visitor interest historic buildings 
evaluating guide system experienced difficulty capturing visitor location context sufficient accuracy 
course problem obtaining inaccurate incorrect contextual information adaptation performed system context produce inappropriate results 
case guide meant presenting list nearby attractions visitor attractions nearby expected 

strategies building context aware applications number strategies identified design interactive systems utilize situated environment context 
strategies analysis existing context aware interactive systems abs addition concerns experienced development evaluation guide system context constrain presentation information simplify specification task crucial adaptation inappropriately determine users interaction 
ii furthermore designers need carefully consider fundamental trade prescription freedom flexibility deciding adapt context 
iii considering adaptation context designers careful bear mind principal need predictability 
course designed adaptation context potential increase integral predictability consistency system 
described abs example inappropriate transfer skills cause difficulties 
technical perspective issues need considered engineering context aware systems 
sensing technology obtaining context needs dependable 
means accurate available timely manner 
ii intelligence agent responsible adapting context needs flexible order cope problems obtaining context potential riding demands user 
hopefully considering strategies issues designers context aware interactive systems avoid potential pitfalls 

considered potential rewards pitfalls utilizing situated environment context design interactive systems 
summary adaptation context develop interactive systems allow users form simplified mental model understanding interacting system 
effect context aware systems migrate complexity away user form intelligent agent 
context ability reduce complexity user task specification reduce quantity increase quality information output system 
ability crucial considering generation interactive systems horizon designed run mobile computing devices 
devices share limited input output bandwidth interface user device maximizing bandwidth paramount importance 
conclude providing designers consider potential hazards context awareness help bring ubiquitous information appliance step closer reality
