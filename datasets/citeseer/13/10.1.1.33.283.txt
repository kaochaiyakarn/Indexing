document management document management tasks occur variety contexts wide range sizes information stores information structures 
example tasks include managing files file system mail messages web pages 
basic information structures user encounter include unordered sets ordered lists hierarchies graphs 
documents may belong information structures 
document browsing searching overviews histories information workspaces employ structures 
concept information workspaces introduced card robertson mackinlay refers environment documents interest compared manipulated stored 
iconic desktops web browser favorites bookmarks web forager examples information workspaces 
related document management systems early graphical methods document management included list views expandable lists viewing hierarchies iconic spatial layouts 
apple macintosh circa included list views spatial layout icon view 
spatial layout allowed user place icons grouping user desired 
apple added expandable lists hierarchies piles 
piles enrich spatial layout allowing user group related documents take screen space group 
form spatial layout treemap space filling layout generated automatically primarily overviews document collections meta data 
semnet early spatial layout documents 
tackled difficult problem visualizing networks 
result difficult understand complexity information layout 
information visualizer project xerox parc introduced broad set visualization interaction techniques understanding information 
maya design group introduced example spatial layout documents user control 
web forager built experience gained information visualizer project introduced spatial layout web pages 
visible language workshop mit media lab research design dynamic virtual information spaces combining typography graphics layout visually appealing interactive information landscapes 
typical desktops windows mac os spatial layout icons overlapping windows 
seen data mountain supports larger number objects prevents overlap page avoidance algorithm uses thumbnail images icons 
selected page preferred viewing position 
uses pad zoomable user interface implement thumbnail image web history mechanism superior text history mechanisms 
authors raise question technique successful thumbnail images zoomable interface 
uses automatic layout short term data mountain uses manual layout exploit spatial memory long term 
techniques mentioned spatial cognition done intentionally 
particular automatic spatial layouts information leverage user ability recognize understand spatial relationships 
interfaces possible display information incurring additional cognitive load pre attentive processing perspective views smaller size indicates spatial relationships distance 
maya design group system web forager intended spatial memory allowing user place documents aid finding 
data mountain advance web forager ways

data mountain visual audio design data mountain provides continuous surface documents dragged 
document dragged remains visible user aware surrounding pages 
direct contrast way web forager user places documents discrete set tiered locations gestures

user act directly placing page continuous surface data mountain aids spatial memory 
data mountain prototype uses planar surface plane tilted degrees shown 
landscape texture data mountain surface provides passive landmarks user meant aid grouping objects categories landmarks explicit meaning 
user place web pages mountain 
practice users create meaning organizing space 
study ways lay set pages compare figures 
right layout layout personal meaning individual created evolves time user control 
note current prototype provides mechanism labeling groups pages category titles 
users requested feature built accurate mental map categories explicit labels 
users employed particularly salient thumbnails visual identifiers groups keeping front members group creating landmarks 
number depth cues designed facilitate spatial cognition 
obvious perspective view occlusion particularly pages moved 
landmarks offer obvious cue may may utilized page placement retrieval 
obvious quite important shadows cast web pages 
subtle pervasive audio cues accompany animations user actions reinforce visual cues 
sound effects highly dynamic 
example moving page user hears humming sound changes pitch speed page dragged indicating spatial location controlling volume low pass filtering panning level 
user moves page pages move way needed producing distinctive sound 
data mountain interaction design user clicks page stored data mountain page moved forward preferred viewing position shown

results principal advantages data mountain user gets advantages environment better space spatial relationships perceived low cognitive overhead interacts simple interaction technique 
page avoidance behavior moving page right behavior pages encountered collisions handled 
tried alternatives improvement driven user comments 

page motion simply passed pages way 
approach suffers problems 
system metaphor harder understand 
addition quite easy put pages right top making difficult find pages 
second tried simulation tall grass 
think happens walk past tall grass 
walk slowly grass moves way slowly returns 
walk fast grass fly way 
implemented simple simulation previously placed pages behave grass displaced page user dragging 
page moved way uses second animation move aside followed second animation move back 
feels lively suffers problems 
solve problem pages location user may drop page close document real location document temporarily displaced soon return causing occlude 
collision avoidance behavior designed eliminate surprises 
movement encounter 
words triggering avoidance dragged page slows hovers place return animation take place causing objects intersect anyway 
essentially technique works continuous dragging tends annoying slow 
note slowing essential part object placement effectively technique caused users create unnecessary occlusion pick just spot displaced page new page 
modified dependent speed basically estimate fail cases 
group data mountain users described experiment page avoidance mechanism 
problems provided strong motivation finding method running set subjects users effectively lost pages due occlusion 
current implementation continually maintain minimum distance pages page moved transitively propagate displacement neighbors necessary 
advantage user dragging page continually sees state result drag terminated animation settling time 
pages get fully obscured 
particular move page leave pages location 
hand displacements may propagate far afield cluster closely packed pages pushed dragged page resulting visual really desirable 
approach feels quite lively final group subjects study
