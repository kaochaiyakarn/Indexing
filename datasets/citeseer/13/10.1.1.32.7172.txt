describes learning environment issues arise developing virtual humans team training design virtual humans extension steve agent previously tutoring 
complex tasks require coordinated actions multiple team members 
team tasks ubiquitous today society example teamwork critical manufacturing emergency room battlefield 
perform effectively team member master individual role learn coordinate actions teammates 
substitute hands experience wide range situations experience difficult acquire required equipment may unavailable training important training situations may difficult re create mistakes real world may expensive hazardous 
cases distributed virtual reality provides promising alternative real world training students possibly different locations cohabit dimensional interactive simulated mock environment practice realistic situations 
availability realistic virtual environment sufficient ensure effective learning 
instructors needed demonstrate correct performance guide students past point errors students requiring instructors continually monitor student activities places heavy burden time may severely limit students training time 
addition team training requires availability appropriate team members may require adversaries 
virtual environments allow students practice scenarios anytime need instructors full set teammates adversaries provide serious training bottleneck 
solution problem complement human instructors teammates intelligent agents take place unavailable

goal support declarative representation allow course authors easily specify task knowledge update necessary rickel johnson 
representation individual tasks previous tutoring satisfies design criteria 
course author describes task standard plan representation russell norvig 
task consists set steps primitive action press button composite action task 
composite actions give tasks hierarchical structure 
second may ordering constraints steps constraints define partial order steps 
role steps task represented set causal links mcallester rosenblitt causal link specifies step plan achieves goal precondition step plan termination task 
example pulling dipstick achieves goal exposing level indicator precondition checking oil level 
task representation suitable structured tasks standard procedures 
suitable tasks require creative problem solving design tasks 
fortunately tasks industry military type structure including operation maintenance equipment trauma care surgical procedures 
representation need viewed fixed sequence steps general causal network steps goals planning algorithm dynamically order steps face unexpected events described section

fortunately team tasks defined roles maintained task execution focus class tasks 
extending steve support team tasks required simple addition task description mapping task steps team roles 
example shows simplified task model transferring thrust control central control station ship

steve able relate task knowledge objects attributes virtual world 
task knowledge human agent instructor requests team task performed steve agent involved task team member instructor uses task knowledge construct complete task model 
request specifies name task performed assigns person agent role task 
starting task description specified task agent recursively expands composite step task description agent fully decomposed hierarchical task model 
role assignments request propagated subtasks task model specifies team member responsible step 
example task loss fuel oil pressure joe joe play role subtask transfer thrust control ccs responsible step press ccs

simulation training especially team tasks agents able robustly handle unexpected events 
scripting agent behavior possible contingencies dynamic virtual world difficult problem compounded agent scripted handle unexpected actions human team member 
option simply prevent human students deviating standard procedures team ability learn consequences mistakes recover 
designed steve task knowledge adapt task execution unfolding scenario 
agent maintains plan complete task current state world 
task model specifies steps required complete task viewed worst case plan 
agents continually monitor state virtual world identify goals task model satisfied partial order planning algorithm construct plan completing task rickel johnson :10.1.1.33.8847
plan subset task model consisting steps relevant completing task ordering constraints causal links indicate role step achieving goals 
prior plan specify agent intended complete task team training plan specifies agent intends team collectively complete task causal links specifying interdependencies team members team member action depends precondition achieved teammate 
agents dynamically interleave construction revision execution plans adapt unfolding scenario 
agent serving missing team member simply performs role task waiting appropriate actions teammates communicating necessary 
contrast agent serving instructor human student interacts student manner similar tutoring 
agent demonstrate student role task explaining action takes monitor student performs task answering questions student needs help 
agent instructor easily shift modes task proceeds student interrupt agent demonstration ask finish task ask agent demonstrate step gets stuck 
team communication team tasks coordination team members critical 
team members coordinate actions simply observing actions teammates spoken communication typically required 
team leaders need issue commands 
team members need inform teammates goal achieved starting activity detect abnormal condition 
team communication important taught practiced team training 
model team communication explicit speech acts task descriptions 
sort structured tasks studied natural documented team procedures specified team member say said 
support extended steve action library include new type action speech act team member 
specification act requires components name task role speech act directed name attribute communicated thrust location value communicated attribute ccs steve agent speaking appropriate text string thrust control central control station 
note want leave text string natural language generator precise utterance 
speech act appears primitive action task description allowing explicitly model relationship task including role responsible performing ordering constraints said causal links specify effect contributes completing task steps depend result 
representation team communication steve agents generate comprehend utterances task execution 
agent plan calls execute speech acts sends text string appropriate speech synthesizers human teammates hear broadcasts semantic representation speech act agent teammates hear 
human says appropriate utterance speech recognizer identifies path domain specific grammar maps appropriate semantic representation broadcasts agents 
agent checks plan see expects speech act person time 
updates specified attribute mental state specified value nods student acknowledgment 
speech recognizer fails understand student utterance utterance appropriate current time student instructor agent responsible giving student appropriate feedback 
important points approach 
applies structured tasks steve agent watching required team communications specified task description suffice tasks require arbitrary communication 
fortunately structured team tasks particularly military include prescribed set utterances 
second steve include natural language understanding abilities valid variations utterances added grammar speech recognizer 
reasonable tasks prescribed utterances 
third note difference approach communication messages purely multi agent system speech recognizer tell utterance intended agents task model determine speaker addressing 
agent treat human student instructor jointly performing role generates speech act treated coming role 
spoken communication typically required team tasks nonverbal communication important 
human students observe actions nearby agent human teammates required proper team coordination 
agents look teammate expecting cue student responsible step 
agents look teammate speaking allowing students follow flow communication recognize addressed 
agents react teammates actions look objects manipulated teammates nod acknowledgment understand teammate says 
tasks require face face collaboration team members nonverbal communication critical
