significant challenges designing implementing real time cooperative editing systems efficient concurrency control constraints short response time short notification time support unconstrained cooperative editing distributed environment 
major inconsistency problems concurrency control needed synchronization coordination concurrent activities maintain consistency real time cooperative editing system presence concurrent operations issued multiple cooperating users nondeterministic propagation latency caused underlying communication network 
illustrate consider operation propagation scenario real time cooperative text editing system sites shown 
operation generated site operations generated site 
concurrency control operations executed locally generated broadcast remote sites executed original form arrival 
major inconsistency problems manifest scenario site site site time scenario generating propagating executing operations real time cooperative editing system concurrency control 
due concurrent generation operations nondeterministic communication latency operations may arrive executed different sites different orders resulting divergent final results 
shown operations scenario arrive executed orders site site site 
operations commutative generally case final editing results identical cooperating sites 
apparently divergent final results prohibited applications consistency final results required real time cooperative software design documentation systems 
second inconsistency problem concerned final results editing session process editing session 
due nondeterministic communication latency operations may executed natural order 
shown operation generated arrival site editing effects shared document seen user site time generated 
may dependent arrives executed site user site confused observing effect observing cause causal order execution called causality violation prohibited applications synchronized interaction multiple users required electronic brainstorming meeting group people simultaneously generate record ideas file 
third inconsistency problem caused concurrent generation independent operations concerned consistency intended effect operation time generation actual effect time execution 
shown operation generated site knowledge generated site independent vice versa 
site executed document state contents document changed preceding execution reverse execution order occurs site 
subsequent execution may refer incorrect position new document state resulting editing effect different intended effect example assume shared document initially contains sequence characters abcde 
suppose intends insert string location bcde intends delete characters starting location cd 
execution operations intention preserved result sites 
actual result site obtained executing followed executing cde 
system able ensure sites identical result identical result violates intention character intended inserted missing final text violates intention characters cd intended deleted final text 
apparently intention violation prohibited cooperative editing systems allow multiple users concurrently edit document
