infostick application making phone call 
normally know person name phone number calling 
find 
phone number impossible call 
infostick user know number stored fig 

infostick programs vcr recording server network 
user simply points infostick phone puts person name phone calls person 
getting information infostick get information physical objects visual markers 
infostick recognizes ids server connected infostick displays list items recognized physical object 
user get information target object directly interaction information appliances 
fig 

user pick printed url poster drop computer putting information infostick application attach digital information tag document note 
example useful attach presentation slide files corresponding document 
infostick user pick slide data computer attach printed marker document 
instance user simply take document conference get presentation file marker put file projector 
user bring computer projector floppy disk 
infostick place necessary information presentation 
infostick piece physical memory bank 
want store data long time put write name title tag 
user wants data get tag 
system teachers announcing information exercises students 
teachers put data title exercise tag students infostick get tag notice board 
fig 

note attached digital data possible note printed visual marker 
user attach digital data note stick objects 
usage provides way organizing digital data physical documents 
networking ubiquitous remain significant 
application infostick augments electric features advantages 
getting information object putting objects everyday life kinds information 
name card typical example 
generally gives person name occupation address phone facsimile number email url 
phone call intuitively select appropriate information phone number card 
facsimile attribute facsimile number phone number 
implicit correspondence target device attributes 
infostick identifies target object automatically selects appropriate information combining attribute id target object id

software architecture infostick system hand held devices designed operating digital physical objects 
aim operate single target remote controller tv set operate target objects 
pda itv uses pda commander interactive tv 
uses different displays task roles pda tv static pda acts commander tv 
seamless manipulation possible exchanging information pda itv interactive 
example possible pick information tv screen drop pda 
computer augmented pen video camera capable recognizing text printed document 
pick information put support inter object operations 
example user operate computer object information pen 
small tag physical container digital information 
user virtually attach carry digital data tag 
system assumes information appliance tag reader writer making different scale environment 
user unable see carried data tag inserted tag reader writers 
drop system direct manipulation technique transfer data different computers computer 
pick drop allows user pick object display drop display operating physical object 
infostick system extension system 
system uses drop metaphor get put operations purpose infostick operate computers physical objects 
developed infostick new hand held interaction device aims provide uniform way operating everyday digital physical objects 
currently infostick recognizes target object combination attached visual markers video camera 
identifies id object infostick searches object name available information related name infostick database network 
idea deploying visual markers object level identification environment aging 
markers advantages disadvantages 
technique enables identify object connected network printed material poster book newspaper visual marker operate easy technology low cost 
hand user know visual marker camera infostick needs pointed 
ways recognizing objects 
include wireless tags infrared ir beacons 
case wireless tag receiver approaches meter tag receiver recognize id number 
hand ir beacon transmits id number environment periodically 
beacon covers room size area relatively robust regarding orientation sensors 
method recognizing objects different advantage appropriately infostick widely 
addition planning provide docking station infostick easy information exchange pcs 
user infostick information stored infostick transferred pc user exchange pc window mouse 
mouse advantages include able grab drag drop object objects window 
contrary infostick receives lot information difficult select items lcd display 
infostick icon pops window put docking station connected computer release delete select objects window mouse
