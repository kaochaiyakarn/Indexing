tacit knowledge vs explicit knowledge polanyi phrase know tell polanyi describe meant tacit knowledge 
tacit knowledge refers personal knowledge intellectual property individual 
kind knowledge articulate complex simply internalised people minds 
nonaka describes tacit knowledge nonaka personal knowledge embedded individual experience shared exchanged direct effective way normal social interaction 
explicit knowledge hand refers knowledge formal systematic language 
kind knowledge easily share articulate independent individual mind

declarative procedural heuristic knowledge declarative knowledge related physical aspect knowledge 
knowledge type required order know 
essential interpreting describing certain viewpoint conceptualisation physical features world 
knowledge objects entities events facts world factual information content area 
procedural knowledge knowledge required accomplish certain task provides description system specific actions required complete particular task 
derives intellectual skill knowing 
conventionally procedural knowledge uses declarative knowledge describe actions step step sequences 
heuristic knowledge describes knowledge related individual experience implicit reasoning 
meaning depends individual experience heuristic knowledge grows personal experience 
heuristic knowledge generated internal process uses declarative procedural knowledge solve problems consequently answer question 
individual knowledge vs group knowledge third category knowledge introduced represent location organisation 
conceptualisation tacit knowledge seen exclusively property individuals 
research clear team interacting individuals knowledge transcends knowledge individually walsh 
buckingham shum organisational knowledge multidisciplinary hard formalise generated discussions competing viewpoints 
third categorisation attempt recognise new understanding knowledge incorporate individual organisational knowledge 
see organisational environment need create additional knowledge categories relate location knowledge
