silkroute architecture silkroute architecture depicted 
serves middleware relational database rdbms application accessing data web 
database administrator starts writing rxl query de nes xml virtual view database 
called view query typically complex transforms relational data deeply nested xml view 
resulting view query virtual meaning evaluated kept source code 
typically applications contact silkroute request data 
application sees virtual xml view underlying relational database 
access data formulates xml ql user query virtual view sends silkroute 
rxl view query xml ql user query passed query composer complex module silkroute 
composer computes composition produces new rxl query called executable query

computed executable query passed translator partitions data extraction part sql queries xml construction part xml template 
translator takes input description relational schema 
silkroute manipulated query source code data

rest section describe system components detail 
view query rxl section describe rxl relational xml transformation language 
rxl essentially combines extraction part sql clause possibly followed sort group clauses construction part xml ql construct clause 
rst example consider rxl query de nes fragment xml view clothing category outerwear construct item category price database fig 
query produce xml fragment 
root element missing explain add 
sql clause declares variables iterate tables 
variable names start 
example tuple variable iterates clothing table 
clause contains zero lters boolean predicates column expressions 
column expression item refers item attribute value case requires equal string outerwear 
construct clause speci es xml value called xml template terms bound table variables 
rxl powerful features possible create arbitrarily complex xml structures nested queries skolem functions block structure 
example nested query clothing construct item problems pid cid construct comments element nested sub query creates zero sub elements report associated product 
readers familiar sql may recognize left outer join clothing problems 
skolem functions allow control way elements grouped 
recall xml attribute type id contains value uniquely identi es element document key 
rxl distinguished attribute id type id value skolem term control grouping element creation 
example clothing construct item cat skolem function cat category skolem term meaning new element exists value category 
id attribute skolem term query create element row clothing 
skolem term element exists category name includes products category 
skolem terms missing rxl introduces automatically 
skolem terms de ne arbitrary graphs rxl enforces semantic constraints guarantee view de nes tree formed xml document 
example skolem term sub element include variables parent element 
block structure allows rxl construct parts complex elements independently 
query blocks clothing construct item price clearance construct disc rst block creates elements form np product name clothing 
second block creates elements form nd product name clearance 
product name occurs clothing clearance elements id key merged npd

pattern syntax xml data may contain variables names start 
filters similar rxl sql 
meaning query follows 
variables clause bound possible ways contents elements xml document 
binding construct clause constructs xml value 
grouping expressed skolem terms construct clause 
example construct clause produces result element value result element contains supplier name list name elements containing product names

composed query fig 

composed query combines fragments user query highlighted 
composed query extracts data relational database way view query 
includes user lter price structures result user query 
details composition subtle complete description composition algorithm section 
call composed query executable typically translated sql queries sent relational database engine 
notice answer executable query quite small user query 
general ecient execute composed query materializing view query composed queries contain constraints scalar values evaluated indexes relational database 
indices little evaluating view query 
example consider user query speci es condition price 
condition propagated executable query sql query evaluated eciently index exists price 
contrast index price useless materializing view query directly 
construct clothing category outerwear pid pid price construct acme clothing item composed rxl query 
translator xml generator translator takes rxl query decomposes sql queries xml template 
sql queries executed relational engine results streams tuples converted xml xml generator 
translator takes source description xml document specifying systems information needed contact source protocol jdbc connection string source speci query driver 
driver translates rxl expressions source query language typically dialect sql query languages supported 
example executable rxl query fig 
translated sql query select pid pid item item clothing category pid pid price sort pid xml template acme clothing item variables pid item refer attributes pid item sql query select clause 
translation sql query sent relational engine resulting tuple stream fed xml generator produces xml output 
example translation requires sql query 
general may ways translate complex rxl query sql queries merge tuple streams xml result 
choosing ecient evaluation strategy may important rxl query returns large result entire xml view materialized 
currently silkroute evaluation strategy generates sql query rxl sub query conjunctive normal form cnf 
sql query sort clause making possible xml generator merge xml document single pass 
alternative approaches described believe general approach exporting relational data xml 
approaches possible cases may desirable 
currently standard interface relational database html form constructs relational query user inputs 
typically interfaces render results query html generate xml 
forms interfaces appropriate casual users inappropriate data exchange applications limit application queries predetermined form interface 
aggregate queries example rarely ered form interfaces 
alternative data provider precompute materialized view compute demand application requests 
feasible xml view small application needs load entire xml view memory dom interface 
precomputed views dynamic data stale acceptable data freshness critical 
third alternative native xml database engine store xml data process queries xml query language 
xml engines replace completely high performance relational databases high performance xml engine appropriate data exchange 
example materialize xml view silkroute store result xml engine process subsequent xml ql queries directly stored materialized view 
ecient xml engine scenario better solution silkroute avoids cost query composition 
don expect native implementations xml ql xml query language xml documents attain performance comparable sql engines relational data anytime soon 
addition approach guarantee data freshness incurs high space cost materializing data completely xml
