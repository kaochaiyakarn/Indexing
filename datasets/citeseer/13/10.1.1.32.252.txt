acf significant advantages traditional content filtering primarily depend error prone machine analysis content 
advantages include ability filter type content text art music mutual funds ability filter complex hard represent concepts taste quality ability serendipitous recommendations 
important note acf technologies necessarily compete content filtering 
cases integrated provide powerful hybrid filtering solution 
acf systems successful research projects grouplens ringo video recommender movielens gaining large followings internet 
commercially highest profile web sites amazon com cdnow com com launch com successful acf technology 
automated collaborative filtering systems proven accurate entertainment domains successful content domains higher risk associated accepting filtering recommendation 
user may willing risk purchasing music cd recommendation acf system probably risk choosing vacation spot mutual fund recommendation 
reasons acf systems trusted high risk content domains 
acf systems stochastic processes compute predictions models heuristic approximations human processes 
second probably important acf systems base computations extremely sparse incomplete data 
conditions lead recommendations correct occasionally wrong 
acf systems today black boxes computerized oracles give advice questioned 
user indicators consult determine trust recommendation doubt 
problems prevented acceptance acf systems low risk content domains 
explanation capabilities provide solution building trust may improve filtering performance people acf systems 
explanation reasoning acf recommendation provides transparency workings acf system 
users trust recommendation know reasons recommendation 
explanations help users understand process acf know strengths weaknesses 
sources error explanations help detect estimate likelihood errors recommendation 
examine different sources errors 
errors recommendations automated collaborative filtering acf systems roughly grouped categories model process errors data errors 
model process errors model process errors occur acf system uses process compute recommendations match user requirements 
example suppose nathan establishes rating profile containing positive ratings movie adaptations shakespeare star trek movies 
prefers shakespeare star trek depends context primarily lady friend movies 
acf system computational model capable recognizing distinct interests represented rating profile 
result acf system may match nathan hard core star trek fans resulting continuous stream recommendations movies loved star trek fan spite nathan 
data errors data errors result inadequacies data computation recommendations 
data errors usually fall classes data poor bad data high variance data 
missing sparse data inherent factors acf computation 
data complete need acf systems predict missing data points 
items users newly entered acf system particularly prone error 
new movie released people rated movie acf base predictions movie small number ratings 
small number people rated movie acf system may base recommendations ratings people share user interests closely 
likewise new users system unwilling spend excessive amounts time entering ratings seeing results forcing acf system produce recommendations small incomplete profile user interests 
result new users may matched people share interests small subset items actuality don share common 
cases considerable amounts data available users items data may contain errors 
example suppose nathan accidentally visits pornography site site located url similar white house residence president 
nathan acf system considers web page visits implicit preference ratings 
accidental visit wrong web site may soon surprised type movies recommended 
visited large number web sites may aware offending rating 
high variance data necessarily considered bad data cause recommendation errors 
example people selected rating profiles similar nathan half rated movie high half rated low 
movie interests proper prediction probably average rating indicating probably predicted acf system
