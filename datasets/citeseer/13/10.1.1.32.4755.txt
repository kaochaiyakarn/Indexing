designing high quality hypermedia applications 
hypermedia applications provide user navigational access information base 
applications usually built specifying set nodes related links 
nodes represent unstructured multimedia information text images video animations provide navigation anchors usually perceived interface buttons hot words reactive interface objects activating anchors follow links nodes 
successful hypermedia application allows user perform task exploring navigational space finding suitable paths desired information suffering disorientation cognitive overhead 
examples hypermedia applications interactive cd rom encyclopedia information systems

context 
problems hypermedia design 
keys distinguishing features hypermedia applications notion navigation 
designing navigational structure application take account types intended users set tasks supposed perform application 
describe navigational structure hypermedia application defining navigational classes constitute customized view application domain 
view defined set base classes node link index 
nodes described types attributes content attributes anchors 
content attributes store information user anchors origin links 
anchors usually implemented interface level reactive objects stimulated trigger navigation 
nodes connected links described origin target nodes 
indexes provide shortcuts desired information 
navigational design poses problems designer preventing user disoriented navigating giving sense location times 
summary hypermedia application successful underlying information architecture allows user find wants easily feeling overwhelmed having browse dozens pages completing task 
patterns address construction sound navigation architectures 
designers tend apply carefully navigation design principles making node reflect object interest domain linking objects strong semantic relationships 
expert designers go creating elaborated navigation architectures 
understand difference naive nodes links data model way outstanding hypermedia applications designed analogy gof gamma design patterns 
naive object oriented designer follow closely main definitions locating state structure behavior domain object application object 
separate state structure state bridge design patterns allocate behaviors different classes strategy command patterns 
patterns sense analogous gof catalog show build navigable information spaces pushing simple hypermedia paradigm step

design patterns hypermedia navigational context patterns patterns address problem dealing collections nodes usually applied individual uses 
set navigation intent provide user closed navigational subspaces easily navigated 
problem hypermedia applications usually involve dealing collections nodes paintings cities persons 
collections may explored different ways task user performing 
example may want explore paintings painter paintings certain subject desirable user move easily node node 
links set members usually reflect semantic relationships seldom implemented hypermedia applications 
usual strategy followed designers consists providing index set members see example results netscape search users go back index navigate member set 
usual simplicity hypertext navigation metaphor lost 
solution consider set navigation class navigation strategy 
group nodes meaningful sets provide intra set navigation facilities indexes links letting user navigate previous elements current 
meaningful provide access element set 
call navigable sets navigational contexts 
show schematic view navigational context 
set navigation navigation inside contexts complements conventional semantic links example connecting painting painter biographies 
words reader browse set leave explore nodes eventually sets 
different ways defining contexts class objects kind context belong class selected giving property satisfied elements example paintings nature link objects kind context class selected belong link 
example paintings picasso 
note particular case type context formed elements part composite object 
enumerated kind context elements explicitly enumerated may belong different classes 
typical example guided tour museum showing different artworks 
dynamic kind context elements inserted navigation 
example type context history maintained browsers 
known uses set navigation successful hypermedia applications 
example microsoft art gallery paintings london national gallery different categories place period subject 
paintings categories browsed sequentially shown 
nodes context navigating sequentially paintings art gallery intent allow node appear different navigational contexts modifying appearance connections nodes current context 
problem suppose context navigation gallery paintings 
reach van gogh choose navigate paintings arrive sun flowers 
reach sun flowers exploring paintings nature 
clear explore object different perspectives 
example accessing van gogh read comments relationships paintings van gogh easy access paintings painted 
painting nature fine read see subject able access paintings theme van gogh 
means need information different way cases provide different links indexes 
notice need access hypermedia nodes different contexts nodes connected contextual links desirable move painting collections 
context node accessed concern node impractical may shield inconsistencies different objects represent component different context 
solution decouple navigational objects context explored define objects peculiarities decorators gamma enrich navigational interface object visited context 
way nodes context allows object may provide different information including links context accessed 
art gallery example anchors shown allow navigating current context accessed sun flowers painting nature button allows see painting nature 
reach sun flowers van gogh painting meaning changes allow navigate paintings 
contextual information reader bottom center pane 
navigational contexts patterns show way organizing application navigational structure 
navigational contexts composed set nodes paintings context links links connect objects context 
nodes decorated additional information particular context additional anchors context links nodes context 
index node may provide links nodes context link 
getting back van gogh example may think painting author types application nodes 
possible navigational contexts theme related context author related context 
accordingly define theme related context decorators author related context decorators defining pertaining information painting show context anchors previous painting context 
diagram interacting elements shown context node index nodes decorator provides anchor node context 
context node decorator node link diagram nodes context pattern 
known uses mentioned microsoft art gallery uses navigational context patterns 
navigational contexts project way things 
active intent provide perceivable permanent current status navigation combining orientation tool easy way navigate set related nodes higher level abstraction problem hypermedia applications particularly involving spatial time structures need provide reader way understand help decide go 
example digital museum want reader see artworks know place museum usual naive solution include index access structure elements intend user navigate 
solution require user backtrack current node index see move node ensuring current position highlighted index 
navigational operations moving backward index forward target may reader 
solution solution maintain active perceivable navigational object acting index navigational objects nodes sub indexes 
object remains perceivable target objects letting user explore objects select related target 
way able interact index target nodes 
note slightly changing usual navigation style hypermedia web applications depart node index closed return backtracking current 
example applying solution city net web site www city net 
see reader permanent located explores cities world see location south america argentina buenos aires left 
particular choose go region city located 
pattern partially showing geographical hierarchy city user visit sites 
sophisticated implementation provide index cities region 
www city net com index cities region see region selected lost inside city 
active reader perceivable permanent record status navigation way provide orientation tool available navigating target nodes 
example active pattern city net countries argentina buenos aires 
interesting example seen le louvre cd rom user explore different rooms museum visual index show 
active le louvre 
notice strategy instantiation active different respect city net 
case user see navigational space rooms region museum select new region new room current region explore 
possible way navigate rooms regions provides user complete sense room located 
example user get information region interface demand pattern garrido painting navigating painting :10.1.1.30.9398
example shows interesting rationale applying active 
le louvre want user explore paintings mainly museum notice spatial structure greater relevance individual painting seen page 
known uses microsoft ultimate frank lloyd wright active applied show buildings different states usa 
microsoft multimedia beethoven access active th 
symphony 
encyclopedia reader permanent access dictionary nodes accessed dictionary 
pattern web seen example city net city net 
news intent large dynamic hypermedia application example web site provide users information new items added 
problem large web sites tree structured way organizing information provides simple navigation metaphor information spaces tend large hardly completely navigated single user 
suppose building site offering great variety hardware products printers scanners 
context new information may frequently added 
users navigate web site thoroughly regularly issue considered success new product may closely related customer knowledge existence 
clearly vital commercial information left chance discovered 
hand trying solve problem poses design challenge web designers balance structured web site information organized items sub items structure star shaped navigational structure information reachable home page 
approach clearly desirable usability site greatly reduced may unmanageable grows 
user provided instant feedback changes additions information available maintaining structured web site 
solution structure home page way space devoted newest additions presenting descriptive headlines regarding 
headlines anchors link related pages 
approach allows designer preserve organization information giving users feedback changes take place web site 
news implement shortcuts information may located leaves tree structured site compromising underlying structure 
notice navigational structure application slightly affected addition temporary links node 
users get information advertised news browsing site usual way 
fact new headlines appear old ones may moved away replaced 
show web sites headlines pattern extensively corporate announcements www ibm com www com www sun com 
additional complementary solution add new indicator splash symbol changing color new changed items naturally occur application 
known uses news hundreds web sites applications www nga gov announce new collections current tours available 
examples websites news pattern www ibm com www com www sun com landmark intent provide easy access different unrelated subsystems hypermedia application 
problem suppose building web information system electronic shopping www amazon com 
entering site build different products videos books cds 
explore products provide links recommendations comments products news describe navigational schema network nodes links types try follow closely relationships existing underlying object model example navigate author books cd list songs includes 
go book comments previous readers read related books may want moment reader jump music book sub stores shopping basket 
build navigational schema linking navigational class book comment news songs music store book store shopping basket spaghetti difficult understand schema links clearly outside model 
solution define set landmarks accessible node network 
interface links landmark look uniform 
way users consistent visual cue landmark 
may different levels landmarking hypertext area visiting 
see example landmarks amazon bookstore 
landmarks amazon com known uses landmarks different web applications www com 
macaulay way things reader permanently jump inventions principles science world machines 
shopping basket intent keep track user selections navigation making selections persistent process user decides 
problem electronic commerce reality web 
users want navigate market decide buy moment 
www amazon com example user browse hundreds books cds choose sub set bought 
naive solution ask user buy product moment finds force bookmark products likes buy navigation session 
clear approaches suited cases want buy dozens different products quite uncomfortable user shop require transaction product 
alternative drawback need navigate check page times wasting connection time 
aware commerce restrictions interfere web site navigational structure 
solution provide users metaphor similar bookmarking allowing select products wants buy traversed 
provide persistent store items shopping basket accessed navigation object associate processing operations basket eliminate item change quantities check solution easy implement adding interface object usually button available product shopping site 
user select product added shopping list 
user navigate shopping basket find detailed description product summarized plus anchor product page 
web sites shopping basket facility enriched validation operations 
example customer planning vacation internet travel agent service travel agent may capable doing checking arrival departure times hotel reservations viability flight connections 
result natural approach resembles way people buy supermarket adding products shopping cart walk 
known uses examples pattern available web 
amazon bookstore www amazon com shown 
example business travel www com user adds different destinations business tour car hotel reservations 
system checks things dates departure arrival different destinations hotel reservation leaving arriving 
completely different example www com image bank users search different kinds images textures backgrounds put list 
furthermore users able create different lists selected pictures persistent web site keeps lists selections user time user logs additions deletions lists 
example shopping basket www amazon com 
customers select book clicking button add current item shopping basket 
selected items shown basket page 
making navigation patterns synergistically defining navigational structure hypermedia application requires defining meaningful nodes connecting judiciously reflecting semantic relationships application domain 
need help user finding desired information feel comfortable navigates 
providing orientation tools maps shortcuts indexes important subtle organization problems usually solved 
described patterns go simple nodes link hypertext model show usual navigation strategies improved solutions patterns 
navigational context patterns set navigation allow providing navigation paths members set enriching navigation architecture structured way 
node may belong different sets nodes context pattern shows way decouple node context accessed decorator design pattern 
active pattern shows way change usual navigational semantics hypermedia applications allowing indexes access structures actively exist target nodes 
application divided sub systems landmark pattern provides cue sub systems readily accessible part application
