broad diverse group experimental results demonstrate algorithms effective efficient robust scalable 

wide area networks particularly internet transformed people interact information 
routine information access general public full text information retrieval opposed traditional controlled vocabulary indexes 
people easy access information located world routinely encounter consider accept reject information highly variable quality 
search engines web large corporate networks usually single database model text retrieval documents network copied centralized database indexed searchable 
single database model successful important valuable information network copied easily 
information copied accessible single database model 
advances information retrieval information proprietary costs money publisher wishes control carefully essentially invisible single database model 
alternative single database model multi database model existence multiple text databases modeled explicitly 
central site stores brief descriptions database database selection service uses resource descriptions identify database satisfy information need 
multi database model applied environments database contents proprietary carefully controlled access limited central site require copies documents database

merging document rankings set databases searched ranked results database merged single ranking 
task difficult document rankings scores produced database different corpus statistics possibly different representations retrieval algorithms usually compared directly 
solutions include computing normalized scores kwok viles french kirsch xu callan estimating normalized scores callan lu merging unnormalized scores dumais 
accurate solution normalize scores documents different databases global corpus statistics kwok viles french xu callan recomputing document scores search client kirsch 
solution requires search systems cooperate example exchanging corpus statistics search client rerank documents prior display 
goal solution required specific cooperation search engines imposed requirements search client 
solution estimate normalized document scores information resource selection service observe directly 
estimation heuristics investigated 
combination score database score document 
heuristics favor documents databases high scores enable high scoring documents low scoring databases ranked highly

delta delta gamma avg avg advances information retrieval number resources searched normalized document score product unnormalized document score database weight database score compares average database score avg heuristic effective databases flawed number databases average database score avg low scoring databases relevant documents added testbed increased avg decreased dramatically change merged document rankings 
second heuristic normalizing database scores observation query constrains range scores resource ranking algorithm produce 
equation set query term score max computed query 
set query term score min computed query 
highest lowest scores resource ranking algorithm potentially assign database 
practice minimum exact maximum overestimate 
min max enable database scores normalized respect query respect databases shown equation

research projects language modeling patent data identified important weakness 
databases organized subject example placing documents computers database documents health care produce idf scores document scores highly skewed 
documents databases query term common probably database query tend low scores due low idf values 
documents databases query term rare probably poor database query tend high scores due high idf values

acquiring resource descriptions acquiring resource descriptions difficult problem especially wide area containing resources controlled parties

solutions require cooperation appropriate controlled environments single organization face problems multi party environments internet 
resource provider cooperate refuses cooperate deceptive cooperative approach fails
