subjects rated faces differently playing poker study 
judged level perceived intelligence face appearance competence 
subjects rated faces equally intelligent thought smiley face realistic face represented true level competence appropriately 
interesting people opinion personification affects way feel expressiveness 
agree group rated expressive faces honest deceiving comfortable honest face intelligent 
disagree group rated face intelligent comfortable 
means disagree group strict simulating real poker situation players expected show honest expressions 
finding having face considered engaging comfortable see poker game environment 
encouraging people favorable having face interface regardless opinion personification 
people distracted presence face facial expressions 
people tried interpret faces facial expressions users pay attention face engage task 
clear faces useful entertainment purposes engagement essential games people don care effort entertainment 
may useful applications require engaged user success education training 
second finding people impressions face different see face isolation versus interact face task 
people evaluate face appearance competence performance 
example people rated perceived intelligence human face dog face smiley caricature realistic face differently rated faces appearance 
differences evaluations rated faces poker game 
psychological hci studies static facial images separately applications 
considering understand study evaluate effects personification context context software agent applications 
course software agents require interfaces 
goal hci understand interface appropriate 
third finding dichotomy user groups opposite opinions personification 
differences facial features character gender humanity expressiveness cause opposite evaluations subject groups 
example dog face preferred favor personification human face preferred 
example favor personification attributed intelligence expressive face thought face higher level intelligence 
experiments performed indicate potential difference evaluation human face non human face subjects gender 
subjects computer expertise age range taken consideration study 
need consider target users designing interface 
interface flexible provide options choose preferred face user
