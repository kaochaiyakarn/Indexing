context toolkit aiding development context aware applications anind dey gregory abowd ubiquitous computing research group computing environments graphics visualization usability center college computing georgia institute technology atlanta ga usa anind abowd cc gatech edu www cc gatech edu fce context important poorly understood poorly utilized source information interactive computing 
particular importance new millennium users move away desktops settings contexts changing rapidly 
context difficult forms user input common reusable way handle 
result context aware applications built ad hoc manner making difficult build new applications evolve existing ones 
easier build applications created context toolkit toolkit provides important abstractions support field context aware computing 
motivation human human interaction great deal information conveyed explicit communication 
gestures facial expressions relationship people objects vicinity shared histories cues assist understanding explicit communication 
shared cues context help facilitate grounding participants interaction 
define context information characterize situation entity entity person place physical computational object 
human computer interaction little shared context human computer 
context human computer interaction includes relevant information entities interaction user computer including user computer 
humans naturally provide context form signs frustration confusion example computers sense 
define applications context provide task relevant information services user context aware 
example context aware tour guide may user location interests display relevant information user 
past years tremendous increase handheld computers 
millennium continue see users move away traditional desktop computing environment 
users increasingly mobile handheld devices interacting computationally enhanced environments move weiser vision ubiquitous computing 
mobile settings user context location people objects dynamic 
handheld ubiquitous computing users expectation access information services 
wide range possible user situations need way services adapt appropriately account user context order best support human computer interaction 
current state context aware computing past research context aware computing shown value context interactive applications 
context allows application tailored user specific situation providing increased benefits user :10.1.1.41.737:10.1.1.29.5833
increased availability commercial shelf sensing technologies making viable sense context variety environments 
prevalence powerful networked computers possible technologies distribute context multiple applications somewhat ubiquitous fashion 
hindered applications making greater context context aware 
major problem lack uniform support building executing types applications 
context aware applications built ad hoc manner heavily influenced underlying technology acquire context 
results lack generality requiring new application built ground 
enable designers easily build context aware applications needs architectural support provides general mechanisms required context 
requirements context glance suggest deal context manner deal explicit user input keyboard mouse activity graphical user interface gui 
investigation identify important distinctions dealing context dealing user input 
distinctions context user input drive requirements toolkit support development context aware applications 
distinction traditional desktop computing applications source user input single computer context aware applications source context distributed computers 
user input context require abstractions separate details sensing mechanisms sensed information 
second distinction context requires additional abstractions context form required application 
example keyboard provides character level input application requires 
global positioning system gps provides location information latitude longitude format context aware application may require name street user 
third distinction gui widgets acquire user input belong application instantiated components acquire context belong application execute independently application 
independence required context acquisition components provide context information multiple context aware applications running simultaneously 
context toolkit built toolkit java addresses distinctions context user input 
toolkit enables application developers built context aware applications 
consists main abstractions widgets 
just gui widgets mediate user application context widgets mediate user environment :10.1.1.32.1627:10.1.1.32.1627
context widgets encapsulate information single piece context location activity example 
provide uniform interface components applications context hiding details underlying context sensing mechanisms 
widgets support traditional poll subscription mechanisms 
aggregators 
context aggregators thought meta widgets capabilities widgets plus providing ability aggregate context information real world entities users places 
acting gateway applications elementary widgets aggregators hide complexity context sensing mechanisms 
interpreters 
context interpreter interpret low level context information higher level information 
example identity location sound level information interpret meeting place 
toolkit distributed nature context transparent context aware applications 
applications need know context components executed remotely locally 
components share common communications mechanism xml supports transparent distribution 
components run independently single application allowing multiple applications 
shows example configuration context toolkit support context aware application 
application aggregator widget sensor widget sensor interpreter interpreter context architecture sample configuration context components 
arrows indicate data flow 
current status research goal research provide toolkit easier application developers context 
toolkit enable developers add context applications context aware increase context applications context aware 
completed public version context toolkit members research group research institutes 
number applications built demonstrate usefulness context toolkit board displays members research group building information display shows relevant information user standing front context aware mailing list delivers email list subscribers currently building augmented electronic whiteboard begins recording handwriting audio detects presence users front :10.1.1.32.1627:10.1.1.32.1627
user information aid retrieval captured session time conference assistant aids conference attendee determining presentations interest capturing presentation notes maintaining awareness colleagues retrieving notes :10.1.1.41.737
currently attempting identify design process set heuristics building context aware applications 
working extensions context toolkit include support dealing uncertain ambiguous context data controlling access personal private context data 
plan study contextaware application developers determine context toolkit easier develop context aware applications context solutions reusable developers
