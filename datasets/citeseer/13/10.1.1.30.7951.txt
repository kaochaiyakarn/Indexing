level protection afforded privacy varies widely applications 
common agreement details private lives birth marriage death matter public record 
hand state maryland crime divulge borrowing history library patron court order 
envision applications user prefer know information represented profile 
lines drawn matter judgement ultimately resolved control information resources 
observations state art early information filtering systems known sdi developed exploit availability information electronic form manage process disseminating scientific information 
printed page dominant information paradigm text transmission high production costs led development extensive social structures peer review process selecting information worthy publication 
long situation persisted dissemination process managed sdi improved performance 
personal computing ubiquitous networking participant able consumer producer information 
drastic reduction publishing costs greatly increased importance filtering resulting flood information resulting variability document quality filtering task difficult 
automatic techniques needed wealth information accessible information better information exist 
simply removing unwanted information information filtering gives consumers ability reorganize information space 
economic reasons information spaces traditionally organized producers cases reorganized intermediaries 
book publishing example authors publishers assign titles books announce availability 
intermediaries libraries book clubs book stores obtain announcements select items interest customers organize information selections ways serve needs customers 
intermediaries typically serve substantial numbers customers economic factors usually limit providing perspectives information space 
information filtering essentially personal intermediation service 
library text filtering system collect information multiple sources produce organization useful patrons 
automating process organizing information space economically feasible personalize organization 
course automating intermediation process eliminates value added human intermediaries apply judgement improve organization information space 
social filtering offers way integrating human automated intermediation 
human intermediaries traditionally organized information space selection annotation 
selection simply special type annotation document marked selected intermediary 
price annotations user may find useful assign expert annotations priori degree confidence come source understood characteristics 
tapestry profile specification language provides example functionality incorporated 
social filtering provide complete solution users information filtering needs 
expert annotations require effort economic value marketplace undoubtedly assign price 
continued reductions cost computing communications resources content filtering offer competitive source information base selections 
furthermore humans machines base evaluations different features systems incorporate social content filtering effective technique isolation 
light schutze colleagues suggests machine learning techniques effectively exploit multiple sources evidence :10.1.1.21.466
content social filtering certainly prove complementary easily measured ways 
perfect content technique find novel limiting range applications useful 
social filtering techniques excel identifying novelty guided humans humans guide overloaded information 
content systems help reduce volume information manageable levels 
content collaborative filtering contribute effectiveness allowing integrated system achieve reliability serendipity 
social filtering realize potential 
difficulty achieving critical mass participants social filtering experiments expensive 
clear experiments additional cognitive load imposed user requirement provide explicit feedback 
aware research implicit feedback applied social filtering evidence approach successful 
hill colleagues reported readers find useful know portions document receive attention readers 
analogy tendency documents acquire characteristics convey similar information call concept read wear 
coarser measurements morita reading time metric save reply decisions explored stevens may prove useful bases social filtering applications 
useful annotations acquired requiring explicit feedback lesser improvement result application simple content filtering technique may sufficient assemble critical mass users needed evaluate social filtering techniques 
serious impediment large scale evaluation social filtering techniques difficulty constructing suitable measures effectiveness 
recall precision fallout comparing content filtering techniques reliance normative judgements document relevance suppresses exactly individual variations social filtering seeks exploit 
feasible evaluation technique apply simulated users sheth investigate specific aspects collaborative behavior 
important issues learning rates variability learning behavior large heterogeneous populations investigated large collections simulated users design tailored explore issues 
alternative study situated users human users performing tasks attempt provide desirable documents measure related satisfaction 
dependent variables certainly sort explicit feedback commonly required social filtering experiments insisting explicit feedback increases difficulty assembling sufficiently large user population 
suitable sources implicit feedback identified measures far better choice set dependent variables 
experiment design requires separate training evaluation document collections feature easily introduced withholding implicit feedback filtering algorithm evaluation period 
approach evaluate content social filtering systems natural choice evaluating systems applied types techniques 
applied suitable sources implicit feedback 
implicit feedback potential high payoff performance evaluation filtering effectiveness user satisfaction research topic accorded high priority 
designers text filtering systems benefit research text retrieval user modeling number fields 
text filtering unique information seeking process distinguished focus satisfying relatively stable interests documents containing text 
report reviewed progress field particular emphasis selection component filtering process 
useful perspectives offered jiang mock stevens 
text filtering systems develop representations documents user interests endowed way comparing documents interests possess way results comparisons assist user document selection 
text retrieval research produced number content representations frequency terms appear documents social filtering research produced complementary set features shared annotations users 
combined implicit explicit feedback user documents examined representations provide basis construction profiles represent user interests 
text retrieval machine learning offer techniques comparing document representations profiles area active research 
document visualization dynamic research area ranked output presently offers simple way synergistically exploiting strengths human machine facilitate filtering process 
text filtering techniques described report offer range solutions help users achieve information seeking goals 
technology presently hand designers produce effective efficient systems useful number applications 
furthermore research applications user modeling implicit feedback shared annotations document visualization text filtering suggests text filtering technology greater impact 
quantity online information continues increase text filtering provide increasingly important technique bringing producers consumers information
