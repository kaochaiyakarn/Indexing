metadata systems exist primary reasons 
firstly provide generic mechanism extension object system 
object need con ned document classically associated metadata systems considered object 
metadata mechanism works associating name value pair object 
provides ability extend attributes object needing change object 
secondly metadata grouping sorting providing access objects system 
scenario metadata system provide information retrieval service 
example possible retrieve objects metadata value called date value date 
linking provides ability associate objects convey semantics associate particular objects 
linking model encapsulate association information independently associated objects
