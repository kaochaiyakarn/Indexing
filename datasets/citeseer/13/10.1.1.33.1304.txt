evolutionary evidence primates studying development mechanisms shared attention normal children provides way decomposing system 
method take evolutionary perspective look abilities shared attention primates 
evolutionary advantages shared attention social creature enormous shared attention allows individual cooperate signal locations food danger predict behavior 
primates show varying degrees sophistication mechanisms shared attention povinelli 
primates recognize exhibit proto declarative pointing 
chimpanzees great apes exhibit gaze shift posture gaze follow line sight

despite differences interpretation social cues evidence primates indicates mechanisms shared attention decomposed different abilities 
abnormal human development addition studying normal development evolutionary development mechanisms shared attention interesting cases abnormal child development provide information decomposing system 
said social signals shared attention interpreted differently non human primates

just human infants innate preference looking human faces eyes cog show hard wired preference look human faces eyes 
scenario requires great deal perceptual capability motor control sensorimotor integration 
simply maintaining eye contact requires ability detect eyes faces maintain eye motor fixation smoothly track visual objects 
second step engage shared attention interpolation gaze 
great apes instructor moves gaze new location student move gaze location 
addition perceptual motor skills required step added functionality requires detecting direction gaze interpolating gaze angle scene knowledge depth 
move gaze monitoring shared attention gaze
