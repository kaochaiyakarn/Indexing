hr exploring space concepts best search measures interestingness 
user supplies set objects interest domain 
numbers number theory 
supply set initial concepts providing definition terms set predicates conjunction defines concept exhaustive examples calculated objects interest 
instance concept multiplication supplied number theory examples column contains integers integers second third columns multiply give 
definition supplied multiplication set pre describing triples integer ii integer iii integer iv divides divides vi theta theory formation proceeds theory formation steps hr takes concept theory passes production rule detailed parameterisation detailing exactly production rule 
production rule generate definition new concept 
hr checks concept theory exactly 
finds match definition new concept added alternative definition old concept new concept discarded 
fact new concept complex defined original hr replaces original concept simpler new 
new concept match theory added theory 
currently hr uses just production rules 
types concepts produce described briefly 
easiest imagine objects discussed integers subobjects divisors 
ffl exists rule produces concepts identifying objects exists subobject particular nature 
ffl forall rule produces concepts identifying objects subobjects particular nature 
ffl size rule produces functions count number subobjects particular nature object 
ffl split rule produces concepts identifying objects particular number subobjects 
ffl match rule produces concepts identifying objects equal subobjects particular nature 
ffl negate rule produces concepts identifying objects properties described old concept properties old concept 
ffl compose rule produces concepts identifying objects properties old concepts 
note rules called unary production rules produce new concept previous concept 
called binary production rules produce new concept previous ones 
see construct concept square numbers concept multiplication theory formation steps required 
firstly match production rule construct concept integers integer square roots 
secondly exists production rule identify integers exists integer square root 
detailed description production rules please see colton 

construction history concept set triples old concept production rule parameterisation detail steps build previous concepts concept 
con multiplication square numbers square roots integer match exists construction square numbers struction history concept user supplied concepts ultimately hr completely re construct concept steps order 
say complexity concept size construction history 
just production rules size space hr searches forming theory large 
limit search usually employ complexity limit 
theory formation steps involving concepts complexity greater limit allowed 
new concept formed added agenda 
concept reaches top agenda theory formation steps involving carried replaced top 
hr perform breadth search puts new concept bottom agenda depth search puts top 
alternatively hr perform unary search combines breadth depth searches 
unary search hr uses unary production rules depth manner binary production rules breadth manner 
means new concept introduced explored thoroughly unary rules combined concepts 
enable effective traversal space enabled hr employ best search step determines interesting concept moves top agenda 
hr different measures available estimate interestingness concept detailed colton 
uses weighted sum values calculated particular concept determine worth concept 
discuss novelty measure 
define note examples concept produce categorisation objects interest theory 
instance square number concept integers squares 
concept theory hr determine categorisation produces examples supplied user 
categorisation particular concept may unique define novelty concept reciprocal number concepts share categorisation 
concepts producing categorisations unique score novel concepts producing categorisations belong concepts score novel
