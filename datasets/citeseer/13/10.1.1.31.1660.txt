introduce new operators framework possible reason decisions commitments actions 
framework decision leads intention action 
decision change state world relation possible 
commitment perform intended action changes deontic state world intended action obligated 
course obligated action may occur 
semantic structure static ought dynamic ought obligation operators 
static operator resembles classical conception obligation truth ideal worlds takes current state past history world account 
necessary allows compare way state reached way committed reach 
show situations expressed easily deontic logic described natural way extended logic described 
fields law computer science frequently occurring situations intentions obligations perform actions arise depending past events 
law main purpose court trial discover actual sequence events led situation crime committed 
usually ways situation reached 
task judge jury find actual way 
basis findings judgement formed leads intended preferred action 
intended action punishment dismissal defendant 
decision change times ruling judge ruling higher court 
final judgement commitment arises obligation public fulfil judgement 
database systems transaction concept maintain integrity database 
transaction conceptually atomic state transition moment occurred occurred 
transaction implemented process atomic guarantees atomicity rollback commit protocol 
database commit different concept commitment studied 
transaction attempt committed rolled back restore state transaction occurred 
transaction committed rolled back compensating transaction performed undo effects transaction 
example money transfer transaction rolled back committed 
history bank account contain money transfer 
transaction committed turns undone obligation arises inform account owner perform compensating transfer returns money lost interest 
case account transactions history 
purpose show examples modelled simple elegant way deontic logic actions intentions limited set temporal operators 
deontic operators treated type temporal operators 
noted approach completely different 
define deontic operators terms temporal objects temporal operators addition deontic aspects 
furthermore view taken past fixed open 
nexttime operator allow fixing action occurs time temporal operators employed 
consider personal private intentions lead obligations individual commitment 
concerned theory intention commitment general account individual agent decides certain actions range possibilities open yielding personal intentions perform actions 
intended actions committed personal commit action results personal obligation 
keep things simple possible abstracted away notion agency way agents may involved making choices notions internal external nondeterminism relevant 
avoided define intentions terms goals reached epistemic concepts agent knowledge belief take intention actions primitive modality approach
