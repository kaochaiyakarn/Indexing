case base product retrieval retrieval adaptation techniques case reasoning cbr important techniques realizing intelligent product recommendation agents 
core applications product database describes specific features available product 
applying cbr product database treated case base product record database interpreted case case base 
case retrieval phase product cases retrieved similarity product features requirements elicited pathways component 
similarity encodes knowledge assess product suitable customer requirements 
websell retrieval component similarity formalized similarity measures modelled combining local similarity measures individual product features global aggregation function 
global individual preferences product selection modelled 
main purpose retrieval component select product database set products highest similarity computed similarity measure 
challenge realise efficient retrieval large highly dynamic product database 
retrieval component provides different similarity retrieval algorithms complete brute force search case retrieval nets similarity retrieval approximation sql queries 
applications demonstrated efficiency websell retrieval component product databases containing tens thousands products 

profiling collaborative recommendation addition case recommendation approach websell provides facility collaborative recommendation user profiling 
context websell user profiles support potential personalisation aspects sales process 
user profile stores past commerce history individual user 
user profiles stored maintained server profile database see 
user associated single profile profile contains user information separated basic category types 
personal information contains various personal details name age gender home address occupation credit card details 
domain preferences contains user information relevant particular domain 
example online travel application domain preferences include information type vacation user interested relaxing versus activity city versus country preferred travel arrangements airline travel virgin british budget details package price exceed 
client side server side registration log profile access service profile database profile manager profile adaptation service community recommender grading feedback recommendation list 
overview websell profiling collaborative recommendation service 

selection lists important type profile information collaborative recommendation viewpoint 
selection lists maintained 
positive selection list sl contains list products user expressed interest purchased 
negative selection list sl contains list products user explicitly ignored past 
collaborative recommendation service websell recommendation scheme allows products recommended target users user profile data sense recommendations personalised user question 
detailed operation collaborative recommendation process described 
key form recommendation ability associate target user group users similar sense profiles similar target user profile 
typically profile similarity measure correlation selection lists user profiles users high degree similarity tend grade products way 
group users similar target user form virtual community target recommendations drawn profiles community members 
result list recommendable products ranked example frequency product community member profiles 
collaborative recommendation step procedure 
identify virtual community associated target user 

produce ranked list recommendable products 
products listed positive selection lists community members contained selection list target user 
products ranked frequency occurrence community 

select top recommendable products recommendations 
final output collaborative recommendation service list products ultimately recommended directly users combined case reasoning recommendation 
collaborative recommendation service responsible identifying virtual communities groups user ids websell user population associating individual users appropriate community 

customisation important objective websell able support sale complex products requiring configuration customisation 
date sales success web simple fixed products books music cds constrained alternatives configurable products 
websell customisation component allows users flexibly completely configure complex products holidays insurance plans technical equipment 
developed approaches origin adaptation techniques cbr 
different approaches developed operator customisation operator customisation approach supports interactive modification products customer 
best matching product retrieved customer set customisation operators provided may applied customise product 
customisation operator encodes particular atomic way adapting certain products 
description operator contains precondition specifies circumstances product modified set parameters specify details customisation action part specifying product affected customisation 
customisation process shown retrieved product left transformed desired target right series operations 
customisation component enables customer navigate space possible customised products takes care applicability operators validity parameter values consistency adapted products 
scenarios operator approach particularly suited support products limited customisation capabilities set applicable operators user 
scenarios clients expert knowledge products operator approach applied complex products 
retrieved product op op op intermediate product intermediate product intermediate product intermediate product op 
operator customisation process 
target product base products components weak part component retrieval alternative components incremental component replacement incremental component replacement approach particularly suited complex products require sophisticated customisation 
assumed products structured subcomponents possibly hierarchical manner 
product databases base products individual sub components required 
retrieving best pre configured base product respect customer requirements product customised incrementally replacing sub components suitable ones 
adaptation cycle depicted shows details replacement procedure 
components low similarity weak components components fulfil customer requirements candidates replaced 
recursively applying cbr level sub component alternative components selected product database 
weak component replaced alternative component validity resulting adapted product checked 
validation constraints exist different components evaluated 
violation leads backtracking component replacement step giving best component chance 
adaptation cycle executed times

generally notice adaptation cycle implements hill climbing search solve combination constraint satisfaction problem optimisation problem product suitability measured similarity 
hand find combination different components representing working product product fulfils constraints
