preliminary market research indicated major technical improvements needed online offerings smarter search personalization 
initial websites concerned offering medical information community information respectively 
challenge medical information site extensive medical vocabulary understood typical users site 
believed users served provided background information medicine organize site expand refine queries 
challenges community site included ways information referred breadth information 
organization scheme synonym searching particularly important site 
additionally sites needed run stan dard commercial tools mainstream platform 
solution needed easily integrated standard search technology verity search tools looked trends websites common need ambitious emerging services 
sites maintain information commercial proprietary database dynamically generate web pages 
provides greater flexibility terms manipulation data allowing benefits simple multiple view generation compressed data storage capacity type integrity checking potentially reasoning capabilities 
site manager perspective provide ability update look feel function service effort fewer errors supporting automatic semiautomatic global updates 
want search functionality function websites generate ephemeral web pages existing response user query content stored forms databases knowledge bases 
considered user needs course users desired search functionality understanding qualities 
ambitious need users unfamiliar site require information subject areas site covers 
users may benefit structured support site browsing usual menu structure site maps simple text searches 
search environment support organization presentation general content site 
users benefit tools support generation accurate questions particularly access speed issues 
important help users fewer inappropriate queries fewer requests server 
background knowledge support goals content structured browsing query refinement 
additionally users may want search data multiple content sources searches access multiple sources transparently desirable 
may useful limit content sources searched 
simple search modules allow users specify sources advanced search functions informed choices user 
trend websites content generation distributed 
community sites event calendars example correct date information content responsibility lies local organization central repository 
find users content providers people know domain best fact may domain expert central community support staff 
search uses background knowledge source knowledge collection utilize domain knowledge community just domain knowledge central repository 
search goals goal search modules provide conceptual retrieval return documents user meaning query just words query 
operationally goals search 
integrate common retrieval techniques 
provide access virtual pages allow access content databases knowledge bases 
simulate understanding query terms 
support browsing content 
support query refinement 
automatically search right knowledge sources information context query 
provide mechanisms experts influence background knowledge collection maintenance hybrid approach search known platform search functionality verity search case considered improve search exploiting knowledge user patterns known forms data domain knowledge information sources 
insured indexing tools understand contained virtual pages 
approaches considered 
approach uses augments standard indexing software index dynamically generated pages 
spider programs provide basic functionality support 
example verity spider supports indexing cgi generated web pages 
second approach obtains content virtual pages appropriately parses typed fields uses output input indexing tool 
approach typically allows flexibility meta information concerning content exploited 
approach different applications 
index content appear static virtual pages task simulate understanding query terms 
means return fewer irrelevant documents relevant documents may missed 
problems supporting browsing query refinement rely domain ontology applied potentially previously categorized content 
order explore approach consider application area known content 
developed knowledge representation augmented search facilities content areas website containing information computer science research organization event calendar application small city community websites focusing primarily directory applications health information website 
common trait sites main content areas fair amount available background knowledge 
example computer science research website know artificial intelligence subclass computer science superclass knowledge representation 
may know description logic subclass knowledge representation 
typical publication title description logics contain phrase description logic contain phrases knowledge representation artificial intelligence 
query publications artificial intelligence knowledge representation articles 
search return relevant description logic publication uses background knowledge subclasses additional evidence superclasses 
initial architecture support retrieval related documents uses verity topic set tool 
allows give phrase evidence phrase 
subclasses knowledge representation evidence superclasses artificial intelligence computer science 
initial population topic sets encodes superclass subclass relationship instance relationships synonyms 
support goals 
reuse generally available ontologies typically contain subclass superclass relationships instances 

generate easily explainable topic sets average users able generate maintain 
topic sets include just subclasses evidence terms provide great flexibility 
include famous artificial intelligence researchers evidence ai concerned individual people instances field ai 
working identifying principled relationships inclusion topic sets 
build initial topic sets gather data effectiveness consider flexibility topic sets strength 
goal move semantically richer representation tool description logics 
see section comments directions respect organizing background knowledge 
worth noting support notion topic sets valuable asset search constrained domains 
entire product line topic sets various search engine languages 
evidence phrases undoubtedly reduce matching document problem increase potentially relevant retrievals 
information retrieval literature course noted increased related results may obtain increased irrelevant results 
controlled experiments remain done issue hypothesis official description logic home page see dl kr org dl 
websites constrained domain information obvious subclass relationships interrelationships benefit approach 
burke take similar view findme project 
additionally common competing statistical methods may apply sites small number documents involved 
example clustering altavista new benefits greatly having large number documents fact altavista interface provide option small number documents retrieved 
issue related retrieval notion limiting scope query 
sites users desired ability limit search certain areas information 
example event web site users want search calendars educational institutions health site may interested diagnostic information disease directory information may interested looking retail stores related sports getting sports articles local 
cases broad categorization information available case sites way meta tagging search including predefined meta tag appropriate 
hand vocabulary agreed meta tagging experts user unaware vocabulary user know term add query 
order help user lack vocabulary familiarity expose high level categories supported tagging 
user type just chooses phrase phrases background knowledge organization restricts search categories 
see view categories limit search 
interface provides high level categories information site 
interfaces categories may opened clicking folder icon category name 
concerned minimizing server fetches clicking folder category moves page area category expanded 
categories opened subcategories exposed 
subcategories may added query clicking checkbox name 
additional evidence phrases may maintained increase ways person search document 
interface taken directory website new jersey town 
clicks categories moved page area category expanded 
shows expansion services category 
click check box services limit search services documents 
wants specific service click specific services limit search checked subcategory 
subcategory may information 
implementation project additional information sub categories 
necessary 
example background knowledge augment search searched beauty searching word beauty obtained documents shown 
documents clearly identified relevant beauty hair provide skin hair body care specialize beauty services 
system user types beauty clicks beauty get benefit background knowledge obtain results shown 
list contains relevant beauty shops site 
example retrieval page shown 
page contain word beauty contain words phrases salon hair design clearly appropriate match 
notice document previously retrieved number ranking variety store moved ranking longer top 
retrievals matches words relevant beauty appropriately retrieved higher score 
content organization site serves purpose providing structured iterative pre sentation content support query refinement 
looking subcategories user gets general impression types information available site 
users supported query formulation simply check boxes interested formulating boolean query 
may type arbitrary information appear search page check boxes refine search system automatically generate boolean query 
example may choose category food drink modify italian find italian restaurants food stores site 
directions keys making background approach support gathering maintaining domain knowledge 
directly indirectly involved knowledge representation techniques support reasoning retrieval number systems see knowledge acquisition task overwhelming part project 
goal provide collaborative topic building environment allows domain experts input information ways topic set expanded modified 
experimenting interface community site allows content providers note words vocabulary think page retrieved matching document 
research site includes interface allows certain users add new subtopic information augment background knowledge 
initial concerned synonym subclass instance relationships 
interfaces semiautomatic automatically integrate new topic information online ontology 
new information suggestions human owner vocabulary evolution task 
issues evaluating environment 
understanding need interface teach users notions class relationship instance relationship synonyms 

compliance user understanding may lead compliance 
need convince users benefits compliance approach 

cheating clever users discover ways cheat system understand approach works 
need understand problem cheating noticeable devise ways limit impact 

interest collaborative approach works convince users participate 
support maintenance encoding background knowledge controlled language object organization classic knowledge representation system automatically identify conflicts subclasses may stated incorrectly synonyms superclasses may identify complex relationships 
describe possible content sources knowledge base support automatic identification sources search user query 
method quite successfully information manifold project gathering usage data evaluate experiments background knowledge collaborative environments support domain knowledge evolution
