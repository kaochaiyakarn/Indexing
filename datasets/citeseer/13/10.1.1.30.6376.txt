fundamental questions social theory conditions facilitate cooperation 
repetition reputation useful features 
repetition causes people cooperate order avoid negative consequences interactions people 
reputations spread information people behavior expectations interactions uence behavior interactions may di erent people 
ways reputations spread ect ability uence behavior especially interesting consider situations people exercise control spread reputations situation common internet 
internet spawned numerous social business environments allow frequent meaningful interactions people relative strangers 
leads problems properties usually arise social settings 
internet social structure allows large degree engineering dicult standard social settings allowing solution problems providing fertile ground application tools economics game theory 
key aspect reputation internet typically arise non electronic settings ability easily change identity real life complex process involving national governments cosmetic surgery internet identity change may require just keystrokes 
person choice interacting example applications include economics information varian economic aspects evaluations avery resnick zeckhauser aspects competition cost sharing moulin shenker herzog shenker estrin various properties learning friedman shenker 
games auction sites interactive forums allow users choose pseudonym register 
services identify users email addresses prevent identity changes users easily acquire new email addresses free services hotmail 
name changes internet enables completely anonymous interactions 
example anonymizing intermediaries remailers proxy servers exchange messages parties revealing identity goldschlag reed syverson rubin reiter 
techniques cryptography allow electronic payments buyer identity untraceable schneier 
anonymously changing identi ers constantly maintaining persistent identity 
case intermediate persistent identities totally anonymous interactions 
ect option anonymity turns transfer reputation information strategic variable controlled player contrast previous milgrom north reputation transfer limited players control 
name changes people easily shed negative reputations 
example health support forums people pretend severe problems 
people reappear di erent forum new identity repeat process 
example alice grady reported woman claimed eating disorder abusive boyfriend gain sympathy eating disorder chat group internet 
eventually continued tales support groups

contrast interested situations reputations serve signals underlying skill motivators performance 
internet knows yesterday dog today 
regardless drove kim behavior ect group trusting closely knit

newcomers put atmosphere suspicion 
easy name changes fair amount cooperation people want develop positive reputations 
example line auction service ebay www ebay com maintains feedback forum buyers sellers comments trade completed 
analyzed peter kollock people go way accumulate positive comments accumulated avoid negative comments 
empirical studies david patrick ali suggest product categories negative comments reduce selling prices studies show clear ect positive comments prices 
newcomers overcome initial distrust accepting bad treatment form dues paying sucient discourage participants changing identi ers 
suspicion newcomers socially inecient especially free owing environments lots newcomers ecient trust newcomers proved untrustworthy provide incentives participants misbehave change identi ers 
distrust eliminated entirely subtle punishment strategy newcomers distrusted veteran player previous period wrong 
strategy quite brittle face malicious participants occasional mistakes trembles typing wrong key accident 
recognizing importance persistent reputations ebay ers easy name changing facility person feedback comments follow name changes 
attempt limit reputation shedding may futile person easily acquire new email address re register trace earlier comments
