search cover material related way current document 
course global search may offered 
suppose looking information network research certain institution 
may go home page 
search network institution ll get unrelated hits 
search network research may get hits word research may appear research documents keywords missing implied context 
hand search pages research department pages related research query network may quite relevant 
getting context query pages initiated 
search better current common way get information browse back forth dozens hundreds pages 
computer supposed 
simple facilities focusing search browsing employed 
attempted limited browsing searching facilities package 
published aside code describe features webglimpse borrowed 
indexes unix file system provides search focused part directory tree 
example looking computer science citation popular demo browse different categories perform search current category 
index needed archive cgi program identifies page search originates limits search accordingly 
search pages created automatically 
information hierarchical organized corresponding hierarchical file system works 
browsing searching capabilities apply arbitrary links sites information neatly organized tree structure 
successful sites quite major 
webglimpse natural extension borrowing features 
idea searching parts hierarchy yahoo search category time 
done similar fashion suffers problem 
example search mentally ill arts category site features collection art mentally ill people 
reason site listed arts therapy listed arts symbolic link located mental health category 
yahoo probably design decision follow symbolic links search links may result unrelated material 
symbolic link subcategory probably better 
kind feature webglimpse easily provides 
web search servers take different approach 
infoseek lycos offer find related sites relationship computed searching database keywords similar major keywords document 
traditional information retrieval approach quite effective lead unusual results 
example tried feature lycos looked related sites accumulated annotations entertainment leisure music instruments individual instruments category 
second match comprehensive data resource www home page health medicine medical research libraries databases indices category 
similarity word accumulated third match space astronomy image files archives category apparently resulted sharing word annotations idea webglimpse utilize neighborhoods allow search additional keywords neighborhoods 
example may want search pages related annotations related jazz 
webglimpse input jazz query probably filtered unrelated documents ended neighborhoods 
example focusing search limited domain current browsing www entrez system national center biotechnology information neighborhoods nucleotide database medline database presents fixed links pages neighborhoods 
determination sequence text neighborhoods millions records database computationally intensive requiring weeks cpu time 
lycos infoseek examples listed entrez allows quickly explore neighborhood document provide search neighborhoods

webglimpse design implementation 
architecture nutshell webglimpse works follows 
indexing time analyzes www archive site collection specific documents private history cache computes neighborhoods user specifications adds search boxes selected pages collects remote pages relevant caches pages locally 
indexing done users browse site search added search boxes limit search neighborhood page search archive 
sense webglimpse transforms archive easier navigate hypertext 
name suggests webglimpse uses glimpse search engine modified slightly add features useful webglimpse 
index needed archive site 
focus neighborhoods collection remote pages done efficient way indexing time search fast 
webglimpse consists programs perform main steps 
performed server publisher administrator set archive actual user search existing archive 
main features followed detailed descriptions 
analysis archive starting set root urls stage traverses local remote pages reachable path links maximum distance initial set 
links contained page extracted corresponding pages followed 
result stage full graph archive edges graph html links 
limit length traversed path set differently local remote pages 
example allow unlimited distance local pages distance remote site 
collection remote documents non local urls fetched saved mirror file system 
optional step 
local archives nicely complemented data remote sources 
example webglimpse collect archive list favorite pages simply bookmarked pages 
links pages general structure preserved 
mirror file system serve hypertext book term page denote html document corresponding url 
collected web 
neighborhoods computations depending neighborhoods defined step practice interleaved step builds neighborhood files help search 
discuss neighborhoods detail section 
addition search boxes selected documents selected documents non empty neighborhoods identified modified addition html code provides search facilities 
possible define pages selected flexible manner 
search glimpse search routines 
ll start description glimpse serves basis design 

glimpse search engine webglimpse glimpse serves default search engine harvest system 
completeness ll mention features glimpse relevant searching browsing problem 
glimpse indexing search software designed slightly different indexing systems 
glimpse index consists essentially parts word file pointers file 
word file simply list words documents followed offset pointers file 
pointers file contains word list pointers original text word appears 
search typically consists stages searches word file searched relevant offsets pointers file 
relevant pointers source text pointers file collected 
second stage search agrep corresponding places original text 
similar principle usual inverted indexes word file relatively small file searched sequentially 
allows glimpse support flexible queries including approximate matching matching parts words regular expressions 
flexible queries implemented running agrep directly word file 
fact files searched directly allows user decide fly match see 
glimpse default show line match grep show paragraph user defined record 
gives context match 
second advantage design pointers file built different ways 
particular granularity pointers precision point set arbitrarily 
pointers exact locations words similar regular inverted indexes documents files containing directories larger granularity need done second stage source searched directly smaller index 
glimpse supports types indexes tiny size files small medium 
medium size index pointers point exact locations small pointers just file names tiny pointers blocks files 
pointers file feature 
pointers indirect 
indexes file called filenames file contains list indexed files 
support webglimpse better added option glimpse store html file name title relevant url 
webglimpse obtains information directly result glimpse search 
typical search gets offsets pointer file gets indexes filename file collects file names possibly titles urls final stage searches files directly 
performance glimpse depends complexity queries size index 
simple queries words patterns boolean operators optimized hashing word file 
queries generally take second 
complex searches obviously take time worth extra flexibility 
compared wais independently system requirements administration maintenance importantly user functionality dramatically better wais searching browsing glimpse particularly suitable purposes supports flexible ways limit search parts information base 
search divided cleanly stages searching words going appropriate files filter files second stage 
done options search added specifically webglimpse 
reads list file names file uses files 
second uses full power agrep filter file names matching 
ll describe webglimpse uses options limit search 

scanning archive webglimpse archive built script called 
script sets right paths archive url cgi bin programs title archive administrative details 
important parameters initial urls traversal archive non local urls collected definition neighborhoods 
traversal archive done straightforward way 
html document analyzed extract outgoing links 
links checked locality ip numbers traversed depth search may change breadthfirst search versions 
webglimpse provides flexible facilities regular expressions define urls files included excluded archive 
example may decide exclude archive files directory called private file called told ya html 
syntax exclude include follows harvest system 

collecting remote pages webglimpse provides facilities collect remote urls include indexing search 
neighborhood include remote urls users may jump neighborhood search remote sites 
believe facility important missing local search facilities 
including remote pages search help users connections harder 
looking network research may find working say stochastic analysis remote link network research 
looking military accidents involving computers may find helicopter incident remote links discussions computers aboard 
feature search global hypertext search 
remote urls webglimpse collects saved separate files mapping mechanism urls file names indexing search done transparently 
original content urls discarded 
space problem mirror files removed search possible incorporated small index 
glimpse modified take account provide limited search showing matching lines anymore original content available show original url typical way show results web 
originally allow recursive collection remote urls webglimpse robot 
user feedback fact multitude robots exist easy deploy allow arbitrary remote collection 
webglimpse robot exclusion rules 

neighborhoods webglimpse traverses archive computes neighborhoods 
current version supports types neighborhoods 
consists pages certain distance default current page 
idea www pages written links related pages neighborhood concept implicit 
second type consists subdirectories recursively similarly way operates 
implementation neighborhood search quite simple 
list file names recall remote urls mapped local file names constitute neighborhood page kept file name mapped page 
search triggered glimpse consults main index finds list files relevant matches intersects list neighborhood page 
neighborhood list fetched query time index depend way allows easy access easy modification needed 
example certain file directory irrelevant reason delete name neighborhood files 
current working version webglimpse added compression neighborhood files save additional space 
compression especially designed glimpse index computed indexing time extra program 
compressed neighborhood files directly glimpse search decompression fly search quick 
webglimpse includes compression decompression programs wants change neighborhoods generate program easily done 
expect people write scripts generating neighborhoods design scripts completely independent webglimpse 
run post processing steps 
neighborhood lists compressed decompressed fly save space concern 
working types neighborhoods general tools allow people flexibility define types 
idea allow neighborhoods page users decide query time 
neighborhood file page plus sets ranges smallest neighborhood contains files second contains files 
classification clustering tools able define neighborhood pages site area 
search boxes integrate browsing searching webglimpse automatically adds small search boxes selected pages 
example search box shown 
html code including box template file easily changed fit preferences archive maintainer 
boxes added indexing time adding html code essentially form field original pages 
boxes added bottom pages special markers implemented html comments added boxes easily removed webglimpse includes program 
possible customize boxes added simply moving markers 
default add boxes html pages non empty neighborhoods 
kind exclude include facilities available selecting pages 
obviously page excluded indexing search box added opposite may true cases 
typical approach web provide link separate search page 
decided add boxes pages users need go search 
minimizes context switching keeps users focused 
see content page compose query 
box includes dynamic link advanced search options 
dynamic sense generated fly display neighborhood generated fly 
search options interface shown 
advanced options include old glimpse options case sensitivity partial match number spelling errors option jump directly line match section 
nice new option allows users search files updated days 
downside adding boxes pages modified users may object especially shared environment pages printed little extra print 
believe cases worthwhile 
course easy modify box just link advanced search 

output output query set records matching file 
webglimpse formats results ways context match webglimpse outputs title matching url link file name corresponds html document glimpse provides matching lines records file names matching lines records output 
general records provide dirty context matches 
webglimpse search box webglimpse search options example webglimpse output searching privilege license providing line numbers glimpse compute right line number match webglimpse option borrowed bring documents automatically line number 
done modifying html document fly insert corresponding anchor trivial links may need recomputed 
highlighting keywords matched keywords highlighted bold html output records case line numbers files links followed 
showing dates modification starting version glimpse provide dates file filter dates show 
webglimpse uses features 
example output match search privilege license demo arizona pages 
date refers copy original document 

experiments experience experience webglimpse quite limited 
give conservative numbers obtained complex archive 
experiments run dec alpha mhz mb ram 
archive experiment pages arizona legislative information system includes information budget committees constitution floor calendars agendas space consuming full text bills 
archive occupies mb files 
number links quite high selected neighborhoods hops page 
hindsight 
neighborhood files big search sufficiently restricted indexing stage slow result 
gives worst case scenario 
selected archive complexity multitude links 
complete indexing process took hours minutes 
took hour traverse archive compute neighborhoods hour analyze html files add search boxes added search boxes files non empty neighborhoods files minutes index thing minutes compress neighborhood files 
mention glimpse indexing compression done done perl 
believe close worst case neighborhood structure complex neighborhoods especially ones floor calendar files contained thousands links 
archive indexing occupied mb increase divided equally index compressed neighborhood files added search boxes 
query times depend heavily type queries 
run experiments typical queries 
expected significant difference archive search neighborhood searches 
running times measured time user clicks search box time results page appears browser range seconds query matches hits seconds complex query hits 
corresponding times pure glimpse search half rest time taken compose html result page 
numbers taken early version webglimpse 
put efforts making webglimpse flexible manner 
expect performance numbers improve tune code

design decisions discuss briefly rationale major design decisions 
said main goals fast search efficient indexing flexible facilities defining neighborhoods non wasteful internet resources 
design decision fixed neighborhoods computed indexing time 
lot discussion lately search agents traverse web looking specific information 
ability explore real time attractive believe moment web slow bandwidth narrow support wide deployment large number wandering agents 
webglimpse thought agent servers users search fixed indexes residing place 
search faster limits flexibility 
particular neighborhoods webglimpse defined users 
possible server maintainer provide different neighborhood definitions users choose 
implemented option 
ability define neighborhood wants important 
put emphasis design unlink neighborhood definition rest system possible 
neighborhoods files consulted search process integrated index way 
fast search conflicts efficient indexing 
spend indexing especially space faster search 
webglimpse designed small archives glimpse puts indexing efficiency slightly search speed 
search quite fast indexing take quite long time 
indexing slowed features having fetch remote documents having compute manipulate complex large neighborhoods 
user interface important search application 
believe design output queries inclusion matched lines highlighted keywords dates modification helpful 
able quickly judge relevance output query problem search services today 
finds oneself spending considerable time multitude links returned results queries 
believe making search box available time typical link different search page idea 
search box take real estate allows users compose search query looking page 
received comments web administrators want modify existing pages add search boxes 
valid concern especially sites pages owned people 
sites strive coherent design adding boxes different requiring certain format adding uniform links main search page 
provide easy tools add remove search boxes time 

applications main application webglimpse course provide search collections hypertext files 
foresee related applications 

building personal topical collections sense webglimpse light version harvest 
full power harvest automatically collect massive information sites extract indexed text different formats 
allow collect organize specific documents relevant 
contrast harvest link structure information kept 
harvest global internet search facilities moves collects flat structure 
hypertext books written easily webglimpse collect index links citations allow flexible browsing book 
lists interesting sites commonly kept people quite substantial 
webglimpse allow maintainers lists easily searchable full text search 

history cache files web browsers cache pages fetch 
typical caches done completely transparent user done performance purposes 
having large set relevant pages helpful 
example years ago designed system called cached pages user demand indexed organized provided full text search 
meant natural extension hot list concept 
similar commercial products allow cache automatically view navigate cache 
history feature just cache 
webglimpse easily construct archive history list 
browse search may discover relationships pages viewing neighborhoods context information 

visualization customization combining webglimpse graph drawing packages allow better visualization hypertext structure 
imagine adding results queries summaries documents icons useful information kind find static pages links related documents 
visit page perform query queries webglimpse simpler context kept domain search smaller get customized view way ahead 
view may just terms information static view relevant 
words navigator build hypertext part way customized areas interest 
particular interesting see combine fixed neighborhood search ideas scatter gather automatic classification system aim 

searching web growing quickly infancy stage 
current facilities quite amazing useful far word word 
finding useful information web frustrating process
