letizia agent assists web browsing henry lieberman media laboratory massachusetts institute technology cambridge ma usa lieber media mit edu letizia user interface agent assists user browsing world wide web 
user operates conventional web browser netscape agent tracks user behavior attempts anticipate items interest doing concurrent autonomous exploration links user current position 
agent automates browsing strategy consisting best search augmented heuristics inferring user interest browsing behavior 
letizia de toledo observed vast library useless rigorously speaking single volume sufficient volume ordinary format printed point type containing infinite number infinitely thin leaves 
jorge luis borges library babel explosive growth world wide web line information sources critical need sort intelligent assistance user browsing interesting information 
past solutions included automated searching programs wais web crawlers respond explicit user queries 
problems solutions user explicitly decide invoke interrupting normal browsing process user remain idle waiting search results 
introduces agent letizia operates tandem conventional web browser mosaic netscape 
agent tracks user browsing behavior links initiating searches requests help tries anticipate items may interest user 
uses simple set heuristics model user browsing behavior 
request display page containing current recommendations user choose follow return conventional browsing activity 
interleaving browsing automated search model adopted letizia search information cooperative venture human user intelligent software agent 
letizia user browse search space linked web documents looking interesting ones 
goals predefined advance 
difference user search letizia user search reliable static evaluation function letizia explore search alternatives faster user 
letizia uses past behavior user anticipate rough approximation user interests 
critical letizia design control structure user manually browse documents conduct searches interruption letizia 
letizia role user interaction merely observe inferences observation user actions relevant requests 
parallel user browsing letizia conducts resource limited search anticipate possible needs user 
time user may request set recommendations letizia current state user browsing letizia search 
recommendations dynamically recomputed changes user request 
letizia tradition behavior interface agents maes lashkari metral maes 
rely preprogrammed knowledge representation structure decisions knowledge domain incrementally acquired result inferences user concrete actions 
letizia adopts strategy midway conventional perspectives information retrieval information filtering sheth maes 
information retrieval suggests image user actively querying base irrelevant knowledge hopes extracting small amount relevant material 
information filtering paints user passive target stream relevant material task remove de emphasize relevant material 
letizia interleave retrieval filtering behavior initiated user agent 
modeling user browsing process user browsing process typically examine current html document web browser decide links follow return document previously encountered history return document explicitly recorded hot list add current document hot list 
goal letizia agent automatically perform exploration user done user browsing documents evaluate results determine user perspective 
request letizia provides recommendations action user part usually form links documents 
letizia leverage comes overlapping search evaluation idle time user reading document 
user better judge relevance document system usually worth making user wait result automated retrieval interrupt browsing process 
best letizia recommendations user unsure 
letizia takes control user interface just provides suggestions 
letizia assume operating situation user invited assistance simulation user intent need extremely accurate useful 
guesses need better guess weak heuristics employed 
inferences user browsing behavior observation user browsing behavior tell system user interests 
heuristics weak contribute judgment document interest 
strongest behaviors user save document explicitly indicating interest 
link indicate things 
decision follow link indicate interest topic link 
user know referenced link time decision follow indication interest tentative best 
user returns immediately having saved target document followed links indication assumed 
letizia saves user considerable time wasted exploring dead links 
link indicator interest document containing link 
pages contain lots links user finds worth interesting 
repeatedly returning document connotes interest spending lot time browsing relative length tracked dwell time 
tendency browse links top left right manner link passed assumed interesting 
link passed remains user chooses links appear document 
choice link reverse indication 
letizia natural language understanding capability content model document simply list keywords 
partial natural language capabilities extract grammatical semantic information quickly perform full natural language understanding lehnert greatly improve accuracy 
letizia uses extensible object oriented architecture facilitate incorporation new heuristics determine interest document dependent user actions history current interactive context content document 
user browses pages having agents 
system infers interest topic agent 
important aspect letizia judgment interest document trying determine measure interesting document preference ordering interest set links 
link high interest agent recommends isn help links interesting agent recommendation isn consequence 
moment primary problem user faced browser interface link choose letizia job recommend possibilities available satisfy user 
letizia sets goal recommend certain percentage settable user links currently available 
user independently browses personal web page publications list 
letizia recommends articles having agents 
example example user starts browsing home pages various general topics artificial intelligence 
user particularly interested topics involving agents zeros pages treat topic general agent info page 
pages word agent name user may search word agent search page system infer interest topic agents browsing behavior 
time user browsing personal home pages reached entirely different route 
personal home page author may contain list author publications 
user browsing publications letizia concurrently scanning list publications find ones may relevance topic interest previously inferred case topic agents 
papers publication list dealing agents suggested letizia 
letizia explain chosen document 
instances represents reason having chosen selects stronger reasons establish plausibility 
case noticed keyword previous exploration case comparison document appeared list returned bibliography search 
persistence interest compelling reasons adopt agent phenomenon persistence interest 
user indicates interest link performing search keyword interest topic rarely ends returning results particular search 
user typically continues interested topic take time restate interest opportunity link search opportunity arises related subject 
agent serves role remembering looking interests expressed past actions 
persistence interest valuable capturing users preferred personal strategies finding information 
web nodes subject oriented indices 
web page university department typically contains links major topics department activity links home pages department personnel 
particular piece may linked subject author 
users may prefer trace personal links subject links may friends organization field just may socially oriented general 
agent letizia picks preferences links labeled people noticing particular names may appear different related contexts 
indications interest probably ought factor decaying time agent get clogged searching interests may fallen user attention 
actions may highly dependent local context forgotten reinforced action 
heuristic forgetting discount suggestions formulated far distance position measured number web links original point discovery 
persistence interest important uncovering serendipitous connections major goal information browsing 
searching topic accidentally uncover information tremendous interest seemingly unrelated topic 
happens surprisingly partly seemingly unrelated topics related non obvious connections 
important role agent play constantly available notice connections bring user attention 
search strategies interface structure web browsers encourages depth search time descends level choices lower level immediately displayed 
return containing document explore brother links level process interface 
user exploring relatively undirected fashion tendency continue explore downward links depth fashion 
user finds deep stack previously chosen documents especially absence visual representation context leads lost hyperspace feeling 
depth orientation unfortunate information interest users typically embedded web hierarchy 
letizia compensates employing breadth search 
achieves utility part reminding users neighboring links escape notice 
user exploration efficient automatically eliding dead links waste users time 
depth letizia search limited practice effects user interaction 
web pages tend relatively similar size terms amount text number links page users tend move web node relatively constant intervals 
user movement immediately search prevents getting far afield 
search potentially combinatorially explosive put resource limitation search activity 
limit expressed maximum number accesses non local web nodes minute 
number reached letizia remains quiescent user initiated interaction 
letizia initiate searches reaches page contains search form benefit enormously doing part agreed web convention search effort 
letizia recommend user go page containing search form 
practice pacing user interaction letizia internal processing time tends keep resource consumption manageable 
autonomous web searching robots exists potential overloading net robot generated communication activity
