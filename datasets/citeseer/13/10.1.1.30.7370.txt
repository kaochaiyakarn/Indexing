planner fact construct plan western 
take clear cut example suppose pat needs bet horse 
try borrow chris outcome action uncertain chris refuse 
alternatively rob convenience store 
plan shall stipulate involve uncertainties bad plan reasons 
better try borrow chris fails rob convenience store 
cassandra generate plan

identical branches possible single plan just different outcomes uncertainty 
instance suppose action asking chris possible outcomes pat gets money chris happy having opportunity favor pat gets money chris unhappy having obliged favor pat get money 
pat constructs plan tries borrow chris bet horse assuming plan depend chris happiness example pat needed get ride track chris plan get money chris happy outcome get money chris unhappy outcome 
cassandra find plan effect find twice outcome uncertainty require decision step discriminate outcomes 
inefficient ways extra search time required find essentially plan twice wasted effort put making unnecessary decision 
looking ways avoid problem

branch merging possible construct plan branches split reunite 
instance consider western plan

contingency due uncertainty traffic western avenue case affect portion plan concerned getting evanston probably little bearing wording toast choice wine 
natural way frame plan assume regardless pryor collins contingency carried planner eventually arrive certain location evanston point single plan developed achieve final goal
