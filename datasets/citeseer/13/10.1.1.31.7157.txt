melissa exchange alan multiple exclamation points signal friendly responsiveness got 
alan returned query lunch fine interviews alan noted email adult thing 
im fun thing discussion comparing im email rick software researcher remarked informal conversational flavor im exchanges 
suggested key reason informality lies nature im 
conversations interactive rapid evolving nature im means immediate context current interaction 
context reduce misunderstandings promote humor 
give take conversation im immediate email tell way evolving people intentions probably mean context 
helps shape context light certain statements meant tongue cheek reason im interactions tend informal users typically interact small set people know plan get know 
buddy lists sample averaged people friends family sixteen coworkers 
practice participants study usually interacted buddies frequent basis 
teen practice appears vary buddy lists larger 
fact participants familiar may contribute relaxed informal conversational style 
communicative functions instant messaging central im support quick questions clarifications ongoing tasks 
helen web page designer insight characterized im say working project want quick response 
im waiting email try contact phone get process having lengthy conversation just want second response 
really insight common workers developing web pages send instant messages inquire matters placement logo page small change wording 
terry programmer insight described process getting im requests small changes web pages quickly making changes making possible get immediate feedback results stuff real time 
ll get request ll fire code change 
ll say hang second change development server ll cut paste url back im say check important reason choosing im media activity efficiency im allowed rapid exchanges possible email overhead face face conversation 
im frequently coordination scheduling 
key reason im immediacy scheduling important know details calendar soon possible 
sending email may read hour may mean previously open schedule slot disappeared entire scheduling interaction 
laura administrative assistant insight described way im admin ask person time open 
im back say schedule right 
may come 
email slow lag time 
im faster calling works users commented able carry efficient exchanges im enabled eliminate certain address associated phone email 
laura insight said bypassed im necessary 
im ing calling part hi trying name coming im know automatically identified want line 
lot faster visibility im contributes greater efficiency tasks requiring rapid responsiveness 
visibility served important alerting mechanism making recipients aware instant messages messages sent email voicemail 
respond quickly consequence 
diane marketing specialist said im interactions secretary respond faster 
call ll leave voicemail get voicemail quickly 
phone ll leave voicemail 
sits im screen ll stuff computer 
waste check email day visible alerting considered users useful affordance users complained distracting working important deadlines 
occasions resorted shutting im 
im coordinate impromptu social meetings took place face face 
pressures today world difficult important 
people go lunch key uses im sites lunch partners coordinating lunch plans 
previous log saw melissa inserted discussion lunch middle serious matters 
people im arrange meet coffee breaks day 
arrangements spur moment 
immediacy im meant participants determine availability short notice 
im preferred email voicemail making arrangements media may accessed immediately 
frequent im keep touch friends family 
im users study friends family connected online course 
interactions brief hi hon interactions provide moment busy day sort pat shoulder participant said 
users exchanges friends coordinating social activities organizing trip visit restaurant 
mike explained just came online say hi say plans needs im injected intimacy easing workers labor allowing connect loved ones quick meaningful ways 
mike observed im nice break mundane aware way continues cross boundaries home reverse true home friends making workplace 
summarize observed people im short questions clarifications coordination scheduling arranging impromptu social meetings keeping touch friends family 
things striking interactions 
flexibility im terms supports 
clarifications coordination task delegation asking granting social favors tracking schedules arranging social meetings 
second im expressive allowing affective communication crisis general office jokes intimate communication friends family 
interesting lightweight technology consisting typing text window succeeds providing context variety social exchanges vivid pleasurable capable conveying humor emotional nuance 
im interactions share characteristics informal face face communication opportunistic brief context rich dyadic 
support view provided fact im certain types face face interaction seen interchangeable 
example early morning arrived office melissa alan call back forth loud holding types conversations documented 
office started filling switched im wanting disturb environment audible informal conversation 
people study enthusiastic im resistors refused im 
felt needed record communications preferred email 
user interface designer interface im tool referred user interface 
third user im working home preferring interruption 
necessary develop general statistics preferences im workplace 
turn entirely different unexpected set uses im support 
informal conversations scheduled negotiating conversational availability problematic 
establishing social connection critical prelude interaction 
informal conversations comprised intermittent interactions effort expended create maintain connection preserve sense conversational context interactions 
interaction participants manage communication situation unfolds 
processes form superstructure facilitates informal communication 
negotiating conversational availability conversational participants get situation available information exchange 
impromptu nature informal communication key problem locate get attention person wishes converse 
workplace phone calls fail reach intended recipients aren talking 
second recurring difficulty initiating informal conversation 
informal conversations normally opportunistic recipient may request talk occurs inconvenient time recipient engaged task conversation 
gives rise fundamental asymmetry conversation time topic convenient initiator necessarily recipient 
asymmetry arises initiators benefit rapid feedback pressing issue recipients forced respond initiator agenda suffering interruption 
participants emphatic problems particularly respect phone 
face face communication mentioned potentially characterized informant face im helped people negotiate availability allowing conversational initiators judge recipients line consulting buddy list 
importantly im provided recipients greater control deciding respond message 
informants talked checking buddy list see recipients active sending message 
helen insight said thing morning opened buddy list looked see online 
boss online saw people commerce online 
designers online knew certain person wanted contact wasn knew check type availability information useful trying track people difficult find means 
keith marketing manager described im availability information get touch stan elusive opposite coast friday left messages stan saying wanted come talk people got response 
stan people buddy list saw come said hey stan 
got time talk said 
turn things people find turned get message daughter having track meet hoping reach 
caught asked talk said busy minutes call back 
called accomplished needed visit today im similar instances observed media spaces initiators pressing question leave open video link determine minute recipient returns office 
buddy list helped conversation initiators judge recipients available partially addressed problem connection failure 
significant benefit im accrued recipient im reduced allowing recipients negotiate availability 
user noted im possible contact way interrupt interrupting see 
phone instant messages easily screened responded users engaged face face conversation offices 
initiators instant messages checked see recipients active sending message 
initiating message arrived inconvenient time recipients ignore ready converse 
im conversations took form initiators attempted determine preparedness recipients im interaction 
people send simple instant messages see available im exchange 
recipient responded attentional contract established parties explicitly agreed communication proceed 
usefulness im technique negotiating availability shown fact instant messages negotiate availability conversations media im 
example informants instant messages phone conversations 
informants offices observed time call rick noted typical im conversation talking time phone conversation 
ll upgrade phone conversation informant noted im preamble formal conversation took place phone 
transitions im phone happened sufficiently frequently insight incorporated system people edited buddy lists include phone extensions 
im negotiate face face conversations 
colocated workers distributed large campuses buildings 
im face face communication efficient allowing people quickly establish face face meeting feasible 
im considered intrusive calling phone dropping 
negotiating availability may involve multiple media parallel 
instant messaging monitored communications place phone calls face face conversations 
lets people prioritize communications maintain awareness events attending tasks 
monitoring difficult media example easy respond phone call carry face face conversation simultaneously happens 
likewise difficult read email carry face face conversation 
contrast monitoring im conversing media reasonably easy 
laura noted re talking somebody picking phone lot destructive seeing im answering know going workers studied felt ignore incoming instant messages offending sender 
people may feel able sender generally doesn know certain intended recipient 
result failing respond necessarily interpreted unresponsive 
im provides plausible deniability presence 
ryan software developer insight commented thing im ll see message won acknowledge presence 
ll respond time informants reported fewer costs associated delaying response im compared media 
message temporarily ignored stays user computer screen reminder see 
responded simply typing window 
responding instant message consequently extremely lightweight compared effort dialing retrieve respond voicemail message finding face face just right moment conversation 
helen insight said choose want respond 
voicemail accessible 
choose respond 
message sitting 
don go get messages nice clean easy way communicate contrast people feel compelled answer phone know identity caller reason calling mitigated somewhat caller id 
alan observed phone intrusive thing im lot just quick thing available short questions 
don mind interruption 
phone call don know really urgent way know calling urgent topic im typically user buddy list 
partially screened irrelevant distraction 
ease screening delayed responding plausible deniability presence allow recipients control responding face face interaction phone 
greater control fundamental communication asymmetry informal communication 
conversations place convenience initiator im allows genuine social negotiation talk 
attentional contract negotiated equal footing initiator recipient face face phone interaction 
may explain im negotiate availability phone calls face face conversations 
communication zones intermittent conversations addition rapid exchanges characteristic im usage observed im completely different way hold intermittent conversations longer periods time 
fact recipients choose respond gave rise intermittent slower paced style im conversation 
im conversations took place minutes hours recipients freedom choose respond 
find im allows longer period time topics ability formulate discussion opposed phone call feel im got find say back 
okay sits don talk head back email im participants establish longer term communication zones move informal conversations 
im create virtual environment similar shared physical office people engaged related tasks sporadic interchanges individual 
ims persistent visible helps preserve ongoing conversational context 
intermittent exchanges straightforward allowing participants attend tasks return im okay just sits 
study participants contrasted intermittent nature im conversations phone calls seen circumscribed lacking im emergent character 
keith put way im minutes communicate 
doesn continuous sure got thought conversation 
phone call phone call okay 
got minutes talk re instant messenger evening comes sort ding person participants contrasted intermittent instant messages exchange emails similar periods time 
intermittent instant messages thought immersive give sense shared space context email exchanges 
observations similar virtual shared office characteristic open video links 
key differences im video im supplies contextual information providing record conversation allows plausible deniability presence affording greater participant privacy 
style conversation extended periods time information exchanged contrasts focus discrete bounded communication events current media theory 
awareness moments process creating maintaining sense social connection 
involved direct information exchange participants im indirect ways create maintain sense connection monitoring buddy list 
somewhat surprise people value simply knowing checked buddy list necessarily wanting interact buddies 
research technologies support generalized awareness reports similar observations 
awareness moments produced certain feeling people accomplishing information exchange 
example alan discussed monitoring buddy list reason feel know people feel re working weekend 
just fascinating know doing re doing 
feel re world creates little universe alan discourse employed spatial metaphor denoting sense occupying world little universe knowing people word feel times short segment talking accomplishing specific task felt 
rick talked awareness information helped form closer bond coworkers see people log re lunch 
kind neat watch people tracking hear sound door clicking notice somebody everybody looking back 
get visual image mind person feel closer people result rick reported feeling 
mere sound simulated door opening closing led visual image mind fostered closeness 
colocated workers maintain sense opportunistically encountered shared spaces coffee rooms hallways 
people collaborating distance encounters rare 
rick colleagues opposite coast argument im partially address problem tell people im helps overcome social problems experience re miles away coworkers 
things forgetting re participants achieved similar effects social connection brief social greetings sent im 
example people sent morning messages im 
noted considered deliver morning message email people appreciated quick im greeting 
mike graphic artist insight said cubes away messages time 
nice way saying hi intrusive note exchange greetings involve substantive information exchange 
aim greeting exchanges inform fact task engender sense closeness connection 
alan described weekend im alan weekends occasionally log home rick working say hi 
interviewer purpose 
alan just say hi 
purpose say 
course purpose quick social moment valued 
people im parallel communication channel establish affective atmosphere contributed feeling social connection 
phone conferences colocated participants sidebar conversations sent messages believe said im phone conferences things place orders lunch designated lunch gofer conference participants time zones far past lunch 
private subgroup activity lent atmosphere colocated participants accomplishing instrumental task getting lunch ordered 
participants likened style instant messaging phone conferences passing notes school awareness moments argue richer notion communication current media theories allow 
direct information exchange place people want maintain connection outside context specific events information exchange 
managing conversational progress final manifestation realized im managing conversational progress form deciding change communication media interaction 
participants im interaction elect change communication medium phone face face email 
call phenomenon media switching 
exchange drawn log characteristic exchanges observed people offices pm john pm hi back minute gap replies bonnie message pm hey getting system reconfigured lost sally aim name 
pm name surprisingly sally smith space 
pm 

things going 
pm little stuff hey question call 
pm sure 
pm 
pm 
pm save trouble looking pm interaction preamble john followed minutes exchange small bit information sally smith aim name proposal media switch opportunistic request telephone call 
phone judged suitable longer conversation john mind 
note john asked phone call bonnie provided opening longer conversation question things going john judged moment reasonable time request longer conversation different medium 
people feel need switch media 
people talked switching felt interaction needed conversation complicated misunderstanding im 
occasions felt just efficient talk type 
alan asked switched takes lines type 
part complex take time typing talking remember occasions new york rick just talking back forth simple things 
point time doing minutes thought just talk 
lengthy 
really see short messages 
single line answers probably best times inefficiency typing associated need access visual shared workspace 
helen insight described way say im ing working project gets point talk 
ll write come sketch talk person getting hard type fast getting detailed media switching reveals element conversation outside information exchange 
participants constantly monitoring progress interaction making corrective suggestions switch media necessary 
managing conversational progress shows participants step outside ongoing information exchanges monitor transform interaction media switching 
discussion findings importance negotiating availability sustaining social connections switching media retaining context workplace conversation suggest areas expansion communication media theories 
current theories orient information exchange 
believe information exchange located wider scope processes outside information exchange people reach social informational ways 
information exchange possible processes including delicate negotiations availability finding ways establish connection inhabiting maintaining shared communication zone continual managing progress interaction including switching media 
think series linked processes interleave feed back 
awareness moments create personal connections lay groundwork interactions drawing people common communicative arena 
process negotiating availability binds people tightly specific interaction establish attentional contract 
management conversational progress specific conversational event enables people direct conversations ways deem appropriate conversation unfolds 
communication zones delimit virtual space series conversations take place 
processes describe dynamically changing looser tighter links scaffold information exchange 
overlaps somewhat research grounding conversational processes ethnomethodological analyses opening closing conversations 
accounts address key aspects phenomena media switching awareness moments creation communication zones stretching individual interactions saw intermittent conversations im 
description negotiating availability concerned problem starting conversation taken theories 
grounding ethnomethodological accounts people enter conversations follow known rules coordinate entry smoothly 
joint commitments established participants agree converse particular topic 
rules conversation joint commitments certainly important constructs tend privilege unproblematic conversational entry smooth function mechanisms adjacency pair 
exceptions assumes initiators know recipient acknowledge initiation attempt 
shown im acknowledgments guaranteed recipients may absent exploit plausible deniability presence ignore converse 
accounts consider problem participant asymmetry phone face face people may feel compelled accept conversational offers wish im problem eased 
characterizes distinct stage set problems prior information exchange participants establish negotiate presence recipient careful strategies manage tensions problems conversational initiation 
symbolic interaction perspective discusses social aspects positing symbolic reasons media choice 
reasons include example showing desire teamwork build trust convey informality urgency personal concern language perspective emphasizes information transfer relational affective aspects communication 
authors observe managers apparently pick face face signal desire teamwork build trust managers sending signals recipients creating activating conversational linkages flows communication zones 
theoretical observations number important technology implications 
im highly versatile supporting awareness negotiating availability intermittent conversations flexible informal communications 
argues strongly integration text messaging technologies media spaces aim support informal communication people collaborating distance 
exceptions media spaces integrated text messaging 
specifically im facilitate initiation conversation 
media spaces initiation supported video 
im negotiate availability may address major problems observed video initiate informal communications remote collaborators 
studies initiators video glance recipients determine availability 
accepted recipients glances converted audio video conversations 
video chance plausible deniability presence systems failed provide successful initiation phone communication 
paradoxically interface provides awareness information may successful addresses problem participant asymmetry 
second benefit im video systems persistence textual conversation maintains conversational context facilitates intermittent interaction leading robust communication zone 
promising area technical innovation phone im integration 
utility im negotiating availability im integrated phone allowing participants negotiate availability provide phone calls 
may reduce current high failure rates initiating phone calls 
im creating parallel channels audio conferences suggests separate new application automatically creates parallel im link people engaged phone call audio conference 
im link private line conversations exchange information urls suited textual transmission 
documented flexibility expressivity im various informal communication tasks 
described unexpected im processes distinct essential information exchange 
suggests broaden theoretical accounts include multiple facets communication interaction information exchange symbolic signals 
research needed document processes media 
provide integrated view multiple facets communication
