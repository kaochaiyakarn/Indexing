information demand problem organize interface way perceivable information node account aesthetic cognitive aspects 
motivation usually find struggling decide show attributes anchors node 
unfortunately screen usually smaller need times media simultaneously playing audio tape showing image technological cognitive reasons 
forces node amount information perceived reader fit screen may distract user attention example audio recording scrolling acceptable firstly reader doesn get view find node scroll way see interests secondly previous problem giving reader freedom choose attributes node interested partitioning node separate windows acceptable equivalent replacing node composite contrary postulated pattern 
solution sub set attributes mot important ones user control information screen providing active interface objects buttons 
activation buttons produce navigation just cause different attributes node shown 
just follows see need principle 
considerations taken account solution example may screen area show different attributes exemplified may select attributes allow appear screen 
dealing kind media attributes analyze situation carefully example audio recording screen may distract user attention wise give user chance activate deactivate played
