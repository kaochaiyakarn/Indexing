offer dtds define structure actual xml documents 
access documents relies special purpose applications query languages closely tied document structures 
approach uses ontologies derive canonical structure dtd access sets distributed xml documents conceptual level show combination conceptual modeling inheritance inference mechanisms hand popularity simplicity flexibility xml hand leads applications providing broad range high quality information 
key words ontologies xml semantic queries extensible markup language xml currently way conquer web especially electronic business cf 

dozens hundreds applications flexible language developed surely follow 
xml designed describe document types domains purposes

general case xml sources web explicit agreement mention formal definition semantics certain tags document structures task correctly interpreting preprint submitted elsevier preprint april data difficult 
information different sources integrated correct assumptions meaning certain elements crucial successful information retrieval 
survey xml vocabularies electronic business industrial standards electronic commerce xml listed standards electronic catalogs representing business transactions 
survey shows standards amount overlap 
applications enterprises need standards forced translate different information sources providing customized routines implementing integration task 
say biggest advantage xml extensibility time biggest handicap 
xml flexible xml documents automatically provided underlying semantics hierarchical information encoded mark tags 
different tag sets different names elements attributes different document structures general aggravate task accessing represented information useful manner

approach enable integrated access different xml document types ontologies 
ontology provides formal shared specification concepts relationships realities domain 
knowledge independent representation ontologies define semantics conceptual level albeit ontology formulated representation language 
approach fulfills task information integration exactly conceptual level lifts information syntactic representational level level concepts relationships 
provide information integration capabilities xml processing defining semantic underpinning xml documents ontologies 
content documents uniformly accessed integrated

query answering focus lie answering queries single xml documents offering integrated access document sets ontology comparison queries ontology support quite illustrative power ontologies integration tasks 
section describe current ways accessing semi structured data general xml documents particular discuss deficits approaches show adding semantics xml overcome deficits 
access semi structured data currently realized number query languages lorel lorel xml xml ql xql :10.1.1.15.3775
query languages access structure documents locate relevant information kinds path expressions templates navigating document tree closely tied document structure syntax 
example xml ql syntax illustrates 
looking people knowledge sgml language people person name name know sgml know person people url construct query delivers content name subelement person iff person containing sgml 
applied xml document get peter hans answers 
skills people person name peter name know sgml know person person name hans name know sgml know know perl know person people seminars seminar topic sgml topic participant name dieter name name name participant seminar seminars skills xml document contains facts seminars assume participants seminars acquire knowledge seminars topics 
assumption knowledge person know topic implicitly encoded document 
retrieve xml ql persons required knowledge second query reflect assumption explicitly specifying alternative pattern retrieve participants seminars sgml topic 
seminar topic sgml topic participant name name participant seminar url construct combined query achieving expected results formulated xml query language xql 
looks person name know sgml union seminar topic sgml participant name possible encodings relevant knowledge guessed information seeker formulate query 
furthermore xql disadvantage official version joins possible variables bound information direct context accessible evaluation path expressions 
easy see information seeker expected formulate multiple queries way domain contains semantic dependencies different parts documents 
domain complex document structures varied hand crafted way retrieving knowledge promising 
retrieve desired information information seeker ideally able specify wishes declaratively conceptual terms persons knowledge sgml formal way forall person know sgml 
declarative query frame logic knowledge base cf 
section 
facts central knowledge base collected xml documents addressed xml ql xql queries 
knowledge base mediates information seeker hand different information sources hand 
concrete realization xml documents unimportant information seeker interested semantically meaningful answers irrespective documents possibly complex varying structures 
conceptual terms query person know defined ontology may xml documents 
fully deploy power ontologies context relationship ontology structure xml documents established 
section show document type definition dtd derived ontology 
direct links xml tags ontological terms manifested 
ontology purposes supporting queries knowledge base defines common vocabulary enable structure independent queries ii provides additional background knowledge improve quality answers 
example assumption participants seminars acquire knowledge part ontology background knowledge 
expressed ontology inference rule query retrieves participants sgml seminars 
area ontologies provide direct benefit query answering comes modeled concept taxonomy 
assume tom programmer fact represented addition xml document programmer name tom name know sgml know know java know know know programmer situation traditional languages querying xml tom retrieved queries everybody knows programmers persons 
kind knowledge modeled concept taxonomy ontology help information seeker find conceptually correct answers frame logic query retrieves tom altered document queries 
sum state art accessing contents xml documents say current query languages strong location wanted data known advance information seeker aware document structure 
locate relevant data specify information needs conceptually elaborated path expressions pattern languages disjunctions wildcards conditions available stick document syntax 
implicit knowledge exploited documents processed directly additional knowledge directly available information seekers 
approach enhances xml query language xql ontological knowledge preprocessing queries 
xql queries rewritten translated queries answered xql query processor 
results basically consider concept hierarchy query rewriting partial solution mentioned deficits xml query languages 
approach enables true semantic queries contents collections xml documents relieves information seeker burden knowing structure documents extensively realized
