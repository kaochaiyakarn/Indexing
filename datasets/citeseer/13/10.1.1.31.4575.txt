question regarding interaction sva format implication individuals low sva may prefer tabular representation items target specific information questions tabular condition faster response times 
provides support including textual information graphical representation low sva users 
regardless study points advantages lifelines graphical representation 
results show benefits type graphical representation display chronological records djj youth record 
hopefully lifelines prototype display help provide easy access large databases temporal personal history information acquisition data quicker effective 
study indicates lifelines provides useful summary record users remember 
tasks requiring interval comparisons information performed faster tabular display
