obviously full mesh sensitive advertises detailed routing information 
ffl workload distribution strongly affect performance different aggregation schemes 
network resources scarce due heavy load performance loss caused accurate routing qos information may significant caused poor load distribution 
principle selecting candidate paths short length giving preference shortest paths minimizes amount resources allocated connection may provide balance load network 
consequently network subjected skewed workload links may saturated quite early allocated connections 
accurate routing information resulting restricted smaller set candidate paths may degrade network performance
