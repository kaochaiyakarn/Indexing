main inspirations drawn formulating format natural deduction calculational proof 
clarity readability calculational proof popular choice computer scientists 
feel pure calculational proof provides little support formal decomposition large proofs smaller ones 
natural deduction hand suited structured decomposition proofs 
natural deduction proofs seldom easy read calculational ones 
structured calculational proof format proposed attempt devise system proof presentation combines readability calculational proof structuring facilities natural deduction 
resulting method resembles robinson staples window inference system hierarchical reasoning maintains visual similarity pleasing notation calculational proof 
structuring calculational proof book predicate calculus program semantics authors dijkstra scholten introduce motivate calculational proof format 
making observation great proofs described series transformations
