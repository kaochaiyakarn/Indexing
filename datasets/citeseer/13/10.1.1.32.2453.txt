information status 
known allerton prince horn inter alia terms old new information meant variety things years 
think differentiate notions old new information 

old new focus presupposition constructions 
distinguish sense old new information may proceed ignore particularly relevant zpg letter 
sense old new typically exemplified sentences john 
ate banana 
focus presupposition constructions chomsky structure proposition convey parts open proposition instantiation variable open proposition john

old new hearer head 
information generally meant entities referents may old new respect speaker beliefs hearer beliefs 
example utter colleague presume colleague mental entity attribute having name sandy thompson believe entity am speaking waiting noon call sandy thompson 
situation np sandy thompson represents information speaker take old respect hearer head inter alia 
conversely want convey general information neighbor believe know sandy thompson say waiting noon call california 
believe neighbor know sandy thompson believe particular entity new respect hearer head 
type old information exemplified old respect hearer beliefs called variety things literature permanent registry kuno culturally clark marshall unused prince things 
understanding old information new information entity assumed known hearer previously prince called brand new 
easily remembered terms hearer old hearer new 
respect linguistic form hearer old entities typically definite proper name sandy thompson hearer new entities typically indefinite california 
likewise indefinite tells reader kid threw hearer new unknown hearer kid definite tells reader sick kid hearer old known hearer kid say speaker park yesterday kid threw park yesterday kid threw correlation definite nps hearer old entities indefinite nps hearer new entities typical means perfect 
thing indefinite definite nps may represent inferrable entities discussed 
second definite nps represent hearer new entities fact case definites behave occur 
point fact sentences require indefinite nps require hearer new nps 
example people sentence formally definite evokes entity hearer new hearer learns set people conferences set people conference sets 
set people known hearer 
compare people conferences 
people conferences 
note ambiguous set people conferences may set identified hearer hearer new may mean previously identified set people hearer old conferences

third indefinite nps represent hearer old entities 
case example generics mentioned 
speaker thinks hearer knows meaning noun minimal condition normal felicitous noun denotes entity type speaker assume hearer knows class entity types generics hearer old 
unavailability generic understandings sentences illustrated note follows automatically discourse constraint sentences logical subject hearer new 
sum hearer status typically categorically marked definiteness hearer old entities typically represented definite nps hearer new indefinite 

old new discourse model 
assessing age entity point view hearer head may assess point view discourse model constructed discourse processing 
entity may old new respect discourse model discourse old discourse new 
np may refer entity evoked prior discourse stretch may evoke entity previously occurred prior discourse stretch 
example preceded simply hi doing sandy thompson california evoke new entities discourse model discourse new entities regardless fact hearer old hearer new 
discourse newness tells entity hearer status 
course entity status hearer new tell discourse status necessarily discourse new hearers expected remember told 
respect linguistic form consider response waiting noon call sandy thompson 
trying get touch sandy thompson 
underlined np represents entity evoked discourse discourse old 
note discourse new sandy thompson formally indistinguishable discourse old occurrence np 
fact interesting english virtually marking np respect discourse status entity represents 
course np indefinite understood evoking hearer new infer discourse new 
marked exception tell form occurred discourse 
possible exception generalization discourse status marked insofar follows hearer status typically marked pronouns 
pronouns indicate entities represent salient appropriately hearer consciousness chafe clark marshall inter alia point construction discourse model 
presumably discourse model 
discourse old 
point discourse time subset usually proper entities evoked salient representable pronoun 
furthermore pronoun especially prior mention different sentence optional 
pronoun probably entails entity represents discourse old entity status entail represented pronoun 
sum category definiteness gives approximate marking hearer status hearer old hearer new analogous marking nps discourse status discourse old discourse new may get certain clues discourse status np marked hearer new optionally salient discourse old 

inferrables 
unfortunately relatively neat binary distinctions third possible status entity discourse model inferrable 
speaker evokes entity discourse case assumes hearer infer discourse existence certain entities speaker beliefs hearer beliefs reasoning ability 
consider example passed door door painted purple 
passed door painted purple 
hearer assumed entity door discussion hearing underlined np discourse old 
contrast hearer assumed mental representation door question discourse old 
door treated known hearer 
hearer knows great deal door knows door door 
quite 
course just entity introduced way 
minimally speaker warrant believing hearer belief entity question plausibly related trigger entity trigger entity minimally relevant point time hearer new hearer able infer existence entity question 
am calling entities inferrables 
case point hearing door hearer assumed mental representation building discussion believe building generally plausibly associated particular door main door entering leaving 
compare passed trunk painted purple 
absence special prior knowledge trunk facade fact car case typically trunk associated trunk case trunk discourse old inferrable trigger inferences crucially involving trunks warrant assuming hearer plausibly infer existence trunk 
inferrables hearer old entities rely certain assumptions hearer know buildings typically doors discourse old entities rely discourse model entity trigger inference 
time inferrables hearer new discourse new entities hearer expected head entity question 
question arises inferrables collapsed category preserving form separate third category information statuses merely points continuum inferrables middle 
evidence collapsing inferrables categories straightforward 
thing linguistic form help decide discourse old entities generally represented types nps 
furthermore clark experimental evidence distinctness inferrables length time hearers take process 
sankoff show tok english currently undergoing ongoing marking certain class inferrables marking information statuses 
approach continuum analysis troubling cognitive grounds pointed chafe inter alia mean continuum head 
knowledge argument continuum silva 
unfortunately silva fails distinguish discourse status hearer status chief evidence continuum terms discourse new hearer old entity older discourse new hearer new entity newer discourse old hearer old entity 
time am lumping single rubric inferrable may subdivided possibly continuum type ease inferencing required 
important area psycholinguistic research shall pursue 
follows shall simply leave inferrables third category shall see fact treated text analyzed 
linguistic form nps representing inferrables situation fairly complex 
reconsider note inferrables may represented definite nps 
consider picked book bought fell 
picked book bought page fell

hand usual understanding simply old page page book just mentioned

containing inferrables

exemplified door painted purple

find nps formed way feel supposed know entity represent fact may 
nps similar inferrables require inferencing basis certain background knowledge difference entity triggers inference case inferrables necessarily prior discourse np 
quite felicitous book question known hearer mentioned discourse hearer prior knowledge relevant door pages 
minimally required speaker knows book speaker believe building typically door book typically pages 
compare trunk painted purple

constraints felicitous containing inferrables just inferrables inferences required hearer beliefs hearer reasonably expected

commonly imagine half audience heard sentence occasion half
