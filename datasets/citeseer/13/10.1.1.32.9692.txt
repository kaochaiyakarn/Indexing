zoomed ranking selection classification algorithms relevant performance information pavel brazdil carlos soares fep university porto campo porto portugal ncc pt june need methods assist user selecting classification algorithms new problem frequently recognized important issue 
previous meta learning approaches algorithm selection consist suggesting algorithm small group algorithms expected perform problem 
believe informative flexible solution provide rankings candidate algorithms 
ranking select just algorithm resources available 
problem constructing rankings seen alternative machine learning methods classification regression 
reason selecting appropriate classification algorithms difficult related issue assess performance 
evaluation measure commonly classification problems error rate 
important consider combination criteria 
may consider instance time learn time apply learned model 
increasing computational power available today may argued time important 
classification algorithms may take weeks months run volumes data organizations commonly store nowadays may acceptable 
may consider interpretability applications decision model understood
