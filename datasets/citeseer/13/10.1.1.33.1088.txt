modelling language modelling single schema extended entity relationship eer conceptual data model adopted 
basic elements er schemas entities denoting set objects called instances denoting set tuples instances different entities involved relationship 
entity involved relationship participation entities relationships represented means er roles unique name assigned 
er roles cardinality constraints limit number instances entity involved relationship 
entities relationships attributes properties value belong predefined domain integer string 
additionally eer model includes taxonomic relations state inclusion assertions entities relationships possibility specify optional covering disjointness constraints

dealing multiple schemas modelling different information sources com may express interschema knowledge means dlr inclusion dependencies 
state interdependencies hold entity relationship expressions different conceptual schemas introduced assertions catarci lenzerini 
assume domain entity relationship attribute er role symbol schema si identified unique symbol ai assertions dependencies views involving symbols different schemas 
worth noting integration process incremental resulting integrated schema monotonically refined soon new understanding calls av 
source point type destination area code land line cell direct data multidimensional cube telephone calls showing average duration 
different component schemas resulting unified schema strongly dependent includes single information sources 
particular important case designing data warehouse conceptual schema assumed privileged schema global view conceptual representation global concepts relationships reconciled abstracted data warehouse necessarily complete model source information 
schema integrated different source schemas 
important point interrelationships source schemas global schema modelled interdependencies source schemas 
global integrated schema data warehouse conceptual schema composed global schema various source schemas assertions

modelling scenario schema integration com 
noticed conceptual modelling highly iterative process 
assume start possible empty partial schema want add new information additional objects properties objects user interested modelled conceptually 
tool provides support design schema making explicit implicit consequences facts modelled far 
detect inconsistencies schema 
likewise new schema output modelling process contain facts explicitly modelled implicit consequences detected reasoner freshly measured quality factors objects new schema 
supports designer conceptual modelling process understanding schema developed far captures intended meaning 
increases belief correctness conceptual schema gives argument inconsistency 
conceptual modelling source integration consider example conceptual design data warehouse telecommunication business 
warehouse want integrate data source contains information concerning specific telephone calls 
suppose source database contains table relating phone calls done customers locations calls 
schema ambiguous sense clear location associated call indicates source destination call 
attempt reuse data new centralised system collecting information analysis mobile phones source schema related global integrated schema talking mobile calls origin destination calls differentiated 
service entity source schema asserted generalise entity global schema entity source schema generalises entity global schema 
lack information real meaning service location entity source schema captured designer assertion relation generalises relationships global schema 
closer took source database reverse engineering phase reveals designer additional interschema constraint stating points source table meaning allegedly underspecified relationship denote call 
view service cell defined service location relationship restricted points asserted specialisation destination relationship 
point fact logically implied integrated schema call source cell point destination point 
fact clearly symptom went wrong 
designer accept 
example reason wrong assumption original relationship modelling sources destinations 
omit integrated schema source relationship specialises service location relationship deduction hold anymore model acceptable 
conceptual modelling multidimensional aggregation conceptual modelling client schema differs conceptual modelling oriented specific information needs different clients users 
depending clients area responsibility task addressed clients interested specific portions data warehouse specific forms representation regarding granularity multidimensional aggregations derive high level information 
conceptual client schema aims capturing specific client demands 
order optimally satisfy clients information needs treatment user specific multidimensional aggregations conceptual level indispensable 
hand conceptual modelling aggregations supports specification adequate quality factors aggregations conceptual level allows take account quality factors mobile calls av 
source point type destination area code land line cell direct data multidimensional cube mobile telephone calls showing average duration 
multidimensional cubes molap rolap data models data warehouse design process franconi 
hand conceptual schema multidimensional aggregation exploited semantic query optimisation 
coming back telecom example useful aggregation analysing nature telephone calls may consider dimension related origin calls land line cell order compute say average duration see 
context particular data warehouse aggregation sense just modelling aggregations com 
mobile calls considered corresponding cube show empty line filled null values corresponding land line type mobile calls see fact case aggregated entity may exist mobile calls originating non cell points 
global schema refined aggregation considering mobile type calls introduced reasoner tell immediately entity inconsistent 
means views may exist data warehouse related aggregation 
extended entity relationship formalism supported com inconsistency detected 
shown aggregating source dimension point level derived inconsistent entity consistent filled values concerning mobile calls
