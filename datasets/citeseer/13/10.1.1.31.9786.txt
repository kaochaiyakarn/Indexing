humans quite successful conveying ideas reacting appropriately 
due factors richness language share common understanding world works implicit understanding everyday situations 
humans talk humans able implicit situational information context increase conversational bandwidth 
unfortunately ability convey ideas transfer humans interacting computers 
traditional interactive computing users impoverished mechanism providing input computers 
consequently computers currently enabled take full advantage context human computer dialogue 
improving computer access context increase richness communication human computer interaction possible produce useful computational services

application builders may need help moving design actual implementation 
help come forms 
combination architectural services features designers build applications 
second form abstractions allow designers think applications higher level

section discuss features abstractions context toolkit propose new abstraction 
features context aware applications context toolkit easy add context existing aware applications evolve existing context aware applications 
addition architecture context aware applications resistant changes context sensing layer 
encapsulates changes impact changes applications need modified 
architecture built concept enabling applications obtain context require having worry context sensed 
previous context widget abstraction implements concept 
context widget responsible acquiring certain type context information information available applications generic manner regardless sensed 
applications access context widgets traditional poll subscribe methods commonly available graphical user interface gui widgets 
gui applications widgets instantiated controlled single application 
contrast context aware applications instantiate individual context widgets able access existing ones require 
meet requirement context widgets operate independently applications 
eases programming burden application designer requiring maintain context widgets allowing easily communicate 
context widgets run independently applications need persistent available time 
important part context historical information context toolkit provides support storage context 
context widgets automatically store context sense history available interested applications 
applications historical information predict actions intentions users 
prediction interpretations functionality encapsulated context interpreter abstraction 
interpreters accept types context produce single piece context 
example converting name mail address 
complicated example interpreting context widgets conference room determine meeting occurring 
traditional user input comes keyboard mouse 
devices connected directly computer 
dealing context devices sense context attached computer running application 
example indoor infrared positioning system may consist infrared emitters detectors building 
sensors physically distributed directly connected single machine 
context toolkit distribution context architecture transparent context aware applications mediating communications applications components 
final abstraction supported architecture aggregation 
context aggregators aggregate collect context 
notion aggregator comes directly definition context 
defined context information characterized situation entity 
think context widget responsible single piece information need abstraction represent entity 
abstraction context aggregator responsible context single entity 
designers think context interactions natural think terms entities aggregator correct abstraction building applications 
aggregators gather context entity person available context widgets behaving proxy context applications 
summarize context toolkit supports common features required context aware applications capture access context storage distribution independent execution applications 
toolkit provides abstractions widgets interpreters aggregators 
situation abstraction support provided context toolkit enabled build number applications difficult build 
experimenting new type abstraction supporting application builders 
new abstraction situation level widgets interpreters aggregators 
idea situation abstraction derived definition context 
currently application designers need explicitly poll subscribe widgets aggregators context information call interpreters determine relevant entities particular state take action 
collection states described situation 
situation abstraction exactly description states relevant entities 
believe providing description requires effort determining individual context components need contacted determining collective situation realized satisfied 
context toolkit responsible translation description wiring context components determining individual elements situation collectively satisfied 
context aware application designers concentrate heart design process determining context aware features application support enacted 
currently limited support situation abstraction 
struggling tradeoff supporting extremely complex situations providing simple method describing situations 
ideally support simultaneously 
simplifying process determining interesting events occur situation abstraction may prove useful users 
holy context aware computing applications right thing right time users 
designers domain specific expertise determine part solution obviously think needed support individual users 
user best position specialize context aware applications meet individual needs 
situation abstraction may allow users perform specialization 
carry user studies investigate situation abstraction appropriate application designers users compares original abstractions widgets aggregators interpreters
