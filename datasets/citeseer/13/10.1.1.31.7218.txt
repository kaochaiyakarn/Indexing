reactive controller behavior control concept simple sensorimotor processes operating parallel enable robots react quickly robustly unpredictable environments 
general paradigm wide variety different architectures proposed 
behavior approaches elden uses set reactive behaviors control low level activity robot elden differs methods behavior activation behavior arbitration 
elden behaviors functions map sensory inputs output functions space possible actions 
output function sum scaled gaussians variable mean width height 
simply specifying single desired action behavior specify number desirable actions priority height action tolerance width deviations desired actions 
behavior arbitration consists summing output functions selecting action corresponding maximum quantized output space 
shows simplified example behavior arbitration piecewise linear functions gaussians 
behaviors specifies array values corresponding value output function quantized point output space represented thin lines 
example output space consists space possible turns 
top behavior votes turn moving straight ahead 
shape output function indicates behavior places moderate priority action wide tolerance variation near action 
array values summed output point greatest sum selected action 
addition small amount random noise added output space allowing elden escape situations outputs behaviors nearly balanced result oscillations

adaptive place network adaptive place network apn provides spatial representation learning system elden contains metric topological information structure environment 
apn composed place units corresponds region cartesian space place links represent relationship adjacent place units 
apn learning exploration navigation 
formally adaptive place network consists set place units set place links 
place unit tuple containing place index cartesian coordinates center corresponding place region 
place link tuple indexes place units connected link approximate heading required travel place place confidence level associated link 
initially apn empty 
timestep distance robot current location determined dead reckoning nearest place unit computed 
distance threshold robot current place index set index nearest place unit 
new unit created cartesian coordinates robot current location robot current place index set index new unit

note discussion timestep corresponds update cycle reactive controller adaptive place network

system elden spatial learning system relies reasonably accurate dead reckoning 
time slippage robot wheels floor results errors position orientation robot 
orientation errors tend serious small errors orientation lead large errors translation locations far origin coordinate frame 
reactive controller handle small errors meter perceptible effect performance 
example obstacles rearranged move opening meter left navigation behaviors may vote robot travel old direction opening obstacle avoidance behavior may vote turning direction new opening 
arbitrator find compromise move robot new opening direction close possible old opening 
larger errors affect basic competency allowing robot move avoiding collisions static moving obstacles large errors may degrade navigation performance 
order insure robot estimated position remains close robot actual position method matching evidence grids 
evidence grids method spatial representation developed moravec elfes 
local region space subdivided cells cartesian grid cell contains value representing estimated probability occupancy 
elden uses dimensional evidence grid square cells centimeters wide 
sensor reading update cell occupancy probabilities bayesian update rule particular sensor model 
example sonar degree arc detects obstacle range meters cells arc distance meters occupancy probability increased cells arc distance meters occupancy probability reduced 
laser rangefinder produces generally accurate precise data simple point model laser range data increasing occupancy probability cell corresponding point returned laser 
evidence grids previously mapping path planning system introduce new technique evidence grids recalibrate dead reckoning 
evidence grids constructed error accumulates robot dead reckoning hill climbing find transformation providing best match grids 
transformation applied robot dead reckoning position estimate determine robot actual location 
place unit apn designated robot home location 
starting exploration elden builds evidence grid represents seen home location robot sonar laser 
grid constructed readings degree rotation increments sonar sensors adding sets readings planar laser rangefinder containing range values rotated degree increments 
entire process requires approximately minutes 
exploring period time elden uses apn reactive controller navigate back place region associated home location uses dead reckoning move coordinates associated center region 
elden builds second evidence grid grids brought registration hill climbing algorithm search space possible translations rotations 
hill climbing algorithm starts null translation rotation grids takes steps space possible translations rotations order maximize match grids 
match quality match quality base cell occupancy probability occupancy probability cell original evidence grid occupancy probability cell second evidence grid 
cells grids initialized experiments sensor readings update occupancy probabilities 
match algorithm steps grids comparing cells corresponding cartesian location 
corresponding cells occupied base probability match quality increased 
corresponding cells occupied base probability match quality increased 
cells effect match score 
hill climbing stepsize initially set cm translation degrees rotation halved local maximum reached order precisely locate maximum 
local maximum reached stepsize cm degrees search stopped resulting maximum output transformation evidence grids 
transformation recalibrate robot dead reckoning
