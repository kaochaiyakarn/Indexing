intuitively thought modeling behavior random surfer 
random surfer simply keeps clicking successive links random

may small impact influence dangling links issue model dangling links 
dangling links simply links point page outgoing links 
affect model clear weight distributed large number 
dangling links simply pages downloaded hard sample entire web pages currently downloaded urls downloaded dangling 
dangling links affect ranking page directly simply remove system pageranks calculated 
pageranks calculated added back affecting things significantly 
notice normalization links page link removed change slightly large effect 
implementation part stanford webbase project pb built complete crawling indexing system current repository web pages 
web crawler needs keep database urls discover urls web 
implement pagerank web crawler simply needs build index links crawls 
simple task non trivial huge volumes involved 
example index current page database days need process web pages second 
links average page depending count link need process links second 
database pages unique urls link compared 
time spent making system resilient face deeply flawed web artifacts 
exist infinitely large sites pages urls 
large fraction web pages incorrect html making parser design difficult 
messy heuristics help crawling process 
example crawl urls cgi bin 
course impossible get correct sample entire web changing 
sites people decide allow sites indexed 
despite believe reasonable representation actual link structure publicly accessible web 
pagerank implementation convert url unique integer store hyperlink database integer ids identify pages 
details implementation pb 
general implemented pagerank manner 
sort link structure parent id dangling links removed link database reasons discussed iterations removes vast majority dangling links 
need initial assignment ranks 
assignment strategies 
going iterate convergence general initial values affect final values just rate convergence 
speed convergence choosing initial assignment 
believe careful choice initial assignment small finite number iterations may result excellent improved performance 
memory allocated weights page 
single precision floating point values bytes amounts megabytes urls 
insufficient ram available hold weights multiple passes implementation uses half memory passes 
weights current time step kept memory previous weights accessed linearly disk 
access link database linear sorted 
kept disk 
data structures large linear disk access allows iteration completed minutes typical workstation 
weights converged add dangling links back recompute rankings 
note adding dangling links back need iterate times required remove dangling links 
dangling links zero weight 
process takes hours current implementation 
strict convergence criteria optimization calculation faster 
efficient techniques estimating eigenvectors improve performance 
noted cost required compute pagerank insignificant compared cost required build full text index 
convergence properties seen graph pagerank large link database converges reasonable tolerance roughly iterations 
convergence half data takes roughly iterations 
graph suggests pagerank scale extremely large collections scaling factor roughly linear log interesting ramifications fact pagerank calculation converges rapidly web expander graph 
understand better give brief overview theory random walks graphs refer motwani raghavan details 
random walk graph stochastic process time step particular node graph choose uniformly random determine node visit time step 
graph said expander case large subset nodes neighborhood set vertices accessible outedges emanating nodes larger factor ff times jsj ff called expansion factor

random walk graph said rapidly mixing quickly time logarithmic size graph converges limiting distribution set nodes graph 
case random walk rapidly mixing graph graph expander eigenvalue separation 
relate pagerank computation note essentially determination limiting distribution random walk web graph

catch information calculate evaluation function available documents crawled 
turns incomplete data pagerank effective way order crawling number known citations 
words pagerank better predictor citation counting measure number citations 
explanation pagerank avoids local maxima citation counting gets stuck 
example citation counting tends get stuck local collections stanford cs web pages long time branch find highly cited pages areas 
pagerank quickly finds stanford homepage important gives preference children resulting efficient broad search 
ability pagerank predict citation counts powerful justification pagerank 
difficult map citation structure web completely pagerank may better citation count approximation citation counts
