advantages xml corporate memory new standard xml major advantages corporate memory management mixing sgml web advantages 
summarize advantages views data 
xml enables manage information knowledge unique structured way enables different processings 
knowledge servers retrieve information clients charge presenting users adapted interfaces 
possible take users context account different views data may possible generate graphic views table contents show data 
furthermore data loaded client browser processed locally xml data processed java applets 
xml may represent data java represents programs transparent portability machines operating systems 
documents built heterogenous data 
xml enables manage structured documents structured data uniform way 
xml format designed enable document description arbitrary data description 
possible mix data documents order build virtual documents issued sources 
data may come technical data base text may come document management environment 
furthermore possible annotate documents modeled knowledge called ontologies 
standard information exchange 
order facilitate communication information exchange community department group companies domain related providers clients may define standard domain oriented application oriented vocabulary means dtd document type definition 
dtd syntactic specification model xml documents 
document considered valid respects dtd associated 
documents data expressed defined xml markups exchanged markups 
document formatting xml companion formalism called xsl extensible stylesheet language define document oriented presentation format 
xsl may document html pdf may generate generic format may generate standard output format 
xsl enables elementary document processing sorting generating table contents tables reorganizing document structure 
xsl possible define output formats document structure xsl document transformation formatting language 
possible write publish times source different media digital ones

hypertext 
xml offer tools build powerful hypertext documents means xll xml linking language xpointer language enables navigation documents structure 
xll implement major hypertext functionality dedicated tools links documents external links links semantics external links documents annotated outside modifying source
