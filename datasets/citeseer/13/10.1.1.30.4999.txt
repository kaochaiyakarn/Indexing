portability section explained potential ar applications require giving user ability walk large environments outdoors 
requires making equipment self contained portable 
existing tracking technology capable tracking user outdoors required accuracy

rendering issues currently graphic images rendered real time photorealistic 
major problem right basic problems need tackled 
furthermore ar applications require photorealistic virtual objects effective 
basic problems solved may time turn ultimate goal generating virtual objects realistic virtually indistinguishable real environment 
demonstrated feature films making interactive application harder 
lighting conditions surface reflections properties measured automatically real time 
sophisticated lighting texturing shading capabilities run interactive rates scene generators 
registration nearly perfect manual intervention adjustments 
difficult tasks ones begun considering fournier 
social political issues technological issues ones need considered trying build real application 
social political dimensions getting new technologies hands real users 
perception counts technological reality different 
example workers perceive lasers health risk may refuse system lasers display trackers lasers eye safe 
ergonomics ease paramount considerations 
ar truly cost effective solution proposed applications determined 
important factor technology perceived threat jobs replacement workers especially corporations undergoing 
ar may regard applications intended tool user job easier completely replaces human worker 
technology transfer normally subject academic papers real problem 
social political concerns ignored attempts move ar research lab hands real users
