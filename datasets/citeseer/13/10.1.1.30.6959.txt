section document describes information mural technique detail 
visualization applications utilize information murals discussion existing visualization systems take advantage technique 
technique imagine visual representation large information space distinct elements representation 
information mural information fit area pixels assume bin associated pixel 
position information element scaled fit available space 
element drawn mural imaginary pen different amounts ink fall different bins manner similar anti aliasing strategies computer graphics 
subsequent element drawn amount ink build different bins depending amount overlap elements 
resulting information mural created mapping amount ink bin information density visual attribute 
grayscale mural shade pixel corresponds proportionally amount ink bin 
grayscale variation equalized intensity variation entire color scale 
mural amount ink bin centered pixel pixels ink appear larger 
color added mural convey attributes informational elements preserving density mapping 
information murals certain information spaces may inappropriate 
distribution information original image may useful information mural created 
example grayscale mural showing graph symmetric function short period dark bar thickness equal amplitude data 
basic algorithm basic algorithm creating information mural listed 
algorithm takes image elements scales mural pixels 
addition data structures store information algorithm requires array floats 
algorithm listed handle attribute colors top density representation 

set mural array zero 
element information compute determine proportion point lies surrounding mural array entries totals mural array floor floor mural array floor ceil mural array ceil floor mural array ceil ceil add proportions determined previous step existing values corresponding mural array entry update max mural array value keep track maximum mural array value 
mural array map value mural array max mural array value grayscale color intensity varying scale pixel size depending type mural created color draw pixel mural mapping computed previous step improved efficiency steps replaced single step adds mural array loor floor updates max mural array value 
avoids having compute number floor ceil percentages lying surrounding pixel effectively eliminating anti aliasing aspect mural 
applications gain performance aliased mural outweighs slight changes appearance 
advanced algorithm considered alternative ways attribute colors added information mural 
discussing positives negatives approach recognized bandwidth limitations imposed pixel mean mural may able show attribute colors piece data time 
information mural technique increases information bandwidth changing intensity size pixels represent density pixel definition single color 
mural compresses data points pixel colored blue red yellow pixel rendered 
sense mix rgb values observer confused equal parts red green data values yellow pixel 
choose color pixel attribute color occurs frequently point mural 
way compute keep track intensity color separately requiring mural array floats different attribute color 
note just keeping red green blue array colors mixed reason mentioned 
large space requirements problem determining maximum intensity value compute resulting pixel density mapping maximum resulting pixel color 
maximum colors 
way really sense treat intensity pixel uniformly cumulatively colors compute mapping respect maximum intensity done basic algorithm 
leads alternative computing attribute colors chosen implement 
reduce space requirements single mural array floats keep track information density pixel 
list shorts possible attribute color kept mural array entry record points attribute color drawn 
tradeoff keeping single intensity value count colors inaccurate reflection exactly intensity due color 
example anti aliased blue points contributing intensity pixel anti aliased red point contributing intensity result blue pixel intensity 
problem arises building anti aliased mural anti aliasing done point contributes intensity single pixel 
solve attribute color bandwidth limitation mentioned different options added implementation
