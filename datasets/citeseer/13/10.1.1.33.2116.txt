discussion gould observed gould recapitulation idea characters develop individual conception maturity may repeat evolutionary history individual species implies fundamental assumption length ancestral ontogeny continuously shortened subsequent evolution lineage 
assumption means older characters appeared certain stage development develop earlier stage ontogeny individuals successive generations phylogenetic characters develop 
recapitulation considered absolute law simple tendency authors pointed acceleration general equal characters new characters introduced stage ontogeny earlier older characters development retarded accelerated see gould 
recapitulation considered result general process evolutionary alteration developmental times rates produce acceleration retardation ontogenetic development specific characters 
remains determined tendencies acceleration retardation dominates particular cases implications processes mckinney mcnamara evolution 
simulation results evidence acceleration retardation ontogenetic development cases acceleration largely outnumber cases retardation see 
prevalence acceleration appears due selective reproduction mechanism favors individuals efficient collecting food soon possible individuals develop functional nervous system sooner ancestors similar explanation see muller 
hand shown anticipation tendency applies functional characters individuals characters imply direct advantage reproductive chances individual 
fact expect observed massart century massart characters function develop 
observed characters appeared earlier phylogeny necessarily preserved ontogeny individuals generations 
characters useless consequence new characters tend lost disappear ontogeny individuals successive generations assumed function internal adaptive value stage necessary induce subsequent developmental characters 
case characters may preserved losing adaptive value 
fact ontogeny infer unknown phylogeny high degree inaccuracy imply interaction ontogeny ignored
