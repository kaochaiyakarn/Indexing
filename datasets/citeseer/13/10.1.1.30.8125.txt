video attributes database record data object distinctive features distinguish data objects 
required proper organization database retrieval properties data 
video data consists sequences images share attributes image data color shape objects positions objects relative layouts texture 
image data video data additional temporal relational attributes cases video data hierarchical structure contiguous frames form shots groups shots form scenes 
shot combined different subset shots produce different semantic scene

items interest usually considered objects spatial semantic relationships objects 
video content additional properties implied motion sequential composition inter intra frame temporal relationships possibly synchronized audio signals 
implied motion image sequences attributed camera global motion object local motion 
camera degrees freedom representing translation axis track boom dolly rotation axis tilt pan rotate 
addition change camera focal length produces scaling magnification image plane zoom zoom 
basic camera operations illustrated fig 
camera situated origin image plane coincident xy plane optical axis axis 
boom dolly rotate track tilt pan zoom basic camera operations general video data contain independently moving objects dimensional space 
object motion typically refers changes object location orientation trajectory velocity shape

third analyzing sequences images fixed domain seek robust methods acquiring motion information applied long sequences containing wide variety video content 
motion queries formulated specifying combination camera motions objects motion paths motion domain dependent independent 
varying levels motion complexities specification motion query 
motion query may consist object running parallel camera camera panning time camera zooming object camera tilting time object moving orthogonally camera 
video retrieval system addition executing queries features inherent images allows user specify camera motions associate motion information object path speed 
single object multiple objects specified query 
multiple objects type similar motion attributes specified query independent objects grouped 
grouped objects perceived optical flow consider mass people moving certain direction crowded highway 
grouping objects reduces flexibility associating types motions object time reduces complexity handling multiple objects query 
object motion domain independent dependent 
motion domain independent retrieval mechanism looks object similar object specified rotated scaled path object may necessarily fixed object follow path sequence 
example sequence boy running boy running middle top bottom diagonally sequence 
domain dependent motion restricts path translation object rotated scaled
