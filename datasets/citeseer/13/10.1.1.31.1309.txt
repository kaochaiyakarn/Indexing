obvious way standard english auction 
game auctioneer continuously raises price 
bidders unwilling pay current price drop bidder left 
hard see remaining bidder person highest value 
important observe price pays willingness pay person second highest value plus tiny amount break tie 
sort auction fine communication costs low iteration cheap 
communication costs high 
example suppose wants conduct auction distributed space time 
way achieve result english auction iteration 
standard form shot auction sealed bid auction 
game player submits sealed bid 
bids opened item awarded person highest bid 
person turn pays price bid 
auction avoids iteration general achieve desired ob awarding item bidder highest value 
suppose bidder value bidder value 
bidder mistakenly believes bidder value 
bidder bids ffl bidder bids amount greater win item 
kind step procedure assign person highest value regardless accuracy beliefs participants turns answer 
vickrey auction works follows 
person submits single sealed bid item awarded person highest bid winning bidder pay second highest bid 
see turns optimal strategy auction person bid true value 
see bid person true value person simplicity suppose bidders 
expected payoff bidder prob gamma bracketed term positive bidder wants probability term large possible 
bracketed term positive setting probability equal maximal value 
bracketed term negative bidder wants probability term small possible 
circumstance setting probability smallest value 
follows setting optimal strategy 
note dominant strategy sense yields highest expected payoff bidder regardless bidder strategy 
note outcome essentially outcome standard english auction highest bidder gets item pays essentially second highest price 
vickrey auction computer science literature doubt places 
optimal person reveal true value vickrey auction ensures item awarded person highest willingness pay 
maximize seller revenue problem considerably complicated construction revenue maximizing auction typically depend beliefs seller buyers values 
case auction maximizes expected seller revenue form similar vickrey auction 
example possible valuations seller set single take leave price believes high probability bidder high valuation vickrey auction

computerized agents appropriate design economic mechanism depends critically model uses describe behavior participants 
economists tended game theory model participant interaction evolution ary models 
game theory criticized hyper rational view human behavior 
may appropriate model software agents presumably software agents better computational powers human beings 
framework game theory mechanism design may find exciting practical application computerized agents human agents point recognized 
additional considerations come play artificial agents human agents 
function effectively computerized agent know lot owner preferences maximum willingness pay 
seller learn buyer willingness pay buyer take leave offer extract surplus 
privacy appears critical problem computerized purchasing agents 
consideration usually arise purely human participants generally thought keep private values secret 
secondly artificial agent guard dynamic strategies extract private information 
example suppose agent knows lowest price master agree selling reservation price safeguard informa current information records past behavior extremely valuable historical data estimate willingness pay 
appropriate technological social safeguards deal problem 
tion buyers 
suppose selling agent follows simple strategy accepting offer higher reservation price 
buyer simply start offer sequence incremental bids ensure ends purchasing price slightly seller reservation price 
typically deal seller 
example far 
australian government auctioned licenses satellite television services 
winning bid licenses called 
government announced won proceeded default bid leaving government award license second highest bidder 
defaulted bid months defaults paid license initial winning bid 
license ended awarded highest bidder second highest price poorly designed auction introduced year delay pay tv australia 
see details story lessons incorporated design spectrum auction 
fact example shows attention mechanism design important 
construct mechanism truthfully revealing true willingness pay dominant strategy need worry keeping pay private 
vickrey auction mechanism dominant strategy game party truthfully reveal willingness pay 
mechanism sort called direct mechanism 
somewhat surprisingly turns class direct mechanisms broader appears 
fundamental result theory mechanism design outline revelation principle shows achieved arbitrary mechanism achieved direct mechanism 
issue keeping willingness pay private mechanism appropriately designed 
generalized vickrey auction vickrey auction described powerful mechanism appears limited scope 
generalization vickrey auction handle complex problems including resource problems appear quit different nature 
generalized vickrey auction gva describe appears part mechanism design folklore doesn appear described writing 
provide detailed argument claims originality respect exposition 
suppose consumers consume goods 
consumption consumer denote money consumption bundle goods consumer consumer holds initial consumption bundle initial amount money allocation goods feasible total amount held including money equals total amount available consumer utility function known quasilinear utility function certain properties convenient analysis 
particular income effects influence demand various goods 
note allows consumer utility depend total allocation goods consumers just gets 
examples specialize form example general specification 
reasonable objective allocating goods consumers allocate way maximizes sum utilities max simple case vickrey auction described utility functions simply difference value payment consumer 
just consumer want reveal value seller participants resource allocation problem general want reveal true utility functions 
problem design mechanism induce participants truthfully reveal private information

multiple units 
suppose units sell 
allocation maximizes sum consumers utilities ji amount allocated consumer sum consumers utilities consumer maximized 
consumer payoff gamma ji see works suppose consumers units allocate 
consumer values unit second unit third unit 
consumer values goods respectively 
inspection optimal assignment give consumer units consumer unit 
consumer receives total utility consumer receives total utility 
gva handles problem 
consumer isn goods go consumer receives utility 
gva consumer net payoff gamma gamma consumer pays units receives 
similarly consumer isn goods go consumer receives utility 
consumer net payoff gamma gamma consumer pays unit receives 
seller receives units sold 
public goods 
suppose consumer initially owns units 
consumer contribute collective pool site licensed software result total collection sum utilities gamma assume delta differentiable increasing concave function 
classic public goods problem 
maximizes sum utilities satisfies condition contribution optimal agent acting satisfies condition conditions assumed total voluntary contributions smaller socially optimal amount 
gva solve problem 
pattern contributions maximizes sum utilities ji pattern contributions maximizes sum utilities omitting utility contribution consumer payoff consumer gamma ji see works practice suppose consumers initial wealth 
total contributed collective consumer net value gamma sum utilities consumers gamma clearly maximized 
sum utilities consumers gamma gamma maximized 
equilibrium payoff consumer theta gamma theta gamma gamma theta gamma effectively consumer pay theta gamma tax top payment making 
tax represents cost consumer imposing consumers presence 
see note consumer isn public provided

mechanism essentially celebrated groves clarke mechanism 
fact proof gva earlier essentially standard proof groves clarke result 
see 
interesting fact standard argument works broader class resource allocation problems classic public goods problem normally applied 
revelation principle gva called direct revelation mechanism message sent center fact entire private information consumer utility function 
imagine indirect mechanism consumer announces bid reservation price 
remarkable achieved indirect mechanism achieved direct mechanism 
assertion known revelation principle 
considered mechanisms truth telling dominant strategy 
revelation principle valid general circumstances particularly easy explain case 
notational simplicity index different types utility function consumer true utility outcome agent reported utility type set reports outcome reports function assigns outcome mechanism 
dominant strategy agent case reports called incentive compatibility constraint 
consider mechanism 
just reporting type mechanism allows consumer send different message consumers send messages resulting allocation dominant strategy consumer messages consumer message depend 
depend consumers types consumer doesn fact revelation principle formulated dominant strategy equilibria 
know 
consumer message depend private information type 
accordingly define function gives optimal message consumer type definition satisfy messages exactly condition characterizes direct revelation mechanism 
optimal message depends true type loss generality designing mechanism message type 
words loss generality restricting direct revelation mechanism 
important design computerized agents says effect gained lost communicating essentials problem 
consider example auction problems examined earlier 
consumer incentive reveal true value auction design ensured consumer hurt full revelation 
fact restrict direct mechanisms privacy issue alluded troublesome
