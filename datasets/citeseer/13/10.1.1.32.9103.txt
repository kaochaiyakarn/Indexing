existing text segmentation falls categories lexical cohesion methods multi source methods 
term repetition 
combines lexical cohesion indicators topic shift 
term repetition includes token word stem entity concept re occurrence similarity 
lexical cohesion methods domain independent robust 
typically applied written documents collection improve information retrieval 
multi source methods require training data determine optimal feature combination 
domain dependent typically applied transcribed spoken text presentation format style exploited improve accuracy
