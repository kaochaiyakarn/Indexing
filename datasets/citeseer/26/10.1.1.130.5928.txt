furthermore shall difficult clients establish signal ipid data shared key allow alice bob communicate noisy channel 
transmission noisy ipid counter assume alice bob want communicate binary symbols channel 
secret key order produce random traffic patterns length corresponding symbols respectively assume hash function takes bit strings produces uniform values interval 
result symbol mapped traffic pattern sequence values interval alice sends round number packets specified sequence symbol wishes emit value time period time 
example transmit string sequence transmitted take time periods 
bob observes packets charlie ipid increments time period ui 
bob determine symbol sent alice

differentiate symbols bob calculates values candidate symbol rj difference value associated correct symbol versus value associated symbols grows linearly length shown full derivation appendix selection traffic levels follows probability distribution example uniform distribution difference function denotes variance distribution see hash function produce values indistinguishable distribution model typical traffic information known adversary 
uniform distribution example distribution insecure adversary logs icmp echo packets events

tcp realization transmission control protocol tcp provides multiplexed reliable bidirectional stream communication internet hosts 
session established hosts way handshake data exchanged directions hosts 
tcp provides facilities rate congestion control shall provide covert communications 
key concepts tcp congestion control acknowledgments windows 
tcp packet contains serial number acknowledgment number 
acknowledgment number set sender serial number tcp packet received part continuous sequence transmission 
conceptually means previous packets smaller sequence number received 
packets acknowledged re sent intervals set algorithms exponential increase delay linear reduction slow congestion 
host provides hint amount data hold buffers time called window size included tcp packet sent 
window size indicates maximum number unacknowledged bytes sent host 
mechanism receiver control rate data reaching 
alice bob want communicate covertly congestion control features tcp modulate global ipid counter 
alice establishes tcp session third party charlie implements ip stack serial ipid values bob 
web request perfectly adequate 
setup tcp connection negotiate suitably small maximal payload size maximum segment size option tcp ensure small amounts data transmitted ip packets generated 
alice control rate intermediary ipid counter increased modulating window size acknowledging packets packet transmission desirable 
result alice lead charlie transmit set number packets pet unit time increase ipid field amount dictated traffic pattern codeword wishes transmit 
bob side keeps windows small acknowledges packet time forcing charlie send packet unit time 
allows bob read charlie ipid counter contained tcp packet adding noise recovering codeword embedded alice 
important note genuine tcp traffic quite large variance result information encoded alice extracted bob despite shorter keywords higher levels traffic compromising covertness 
degree tcp traffic characteristics perfectly match typical tcp connection depends level surveillance expected
