route maintenance conventional routing protocols integrate route discovery route maintenance continuously sending periodic routing updates 
status link router changes periodic updates eventually reflect changes routers presumably resulting computation new routes 
route discovery periodic messages kind mobile hosts 
route route maintenance procedure monitors operation route informs sender routing errors 
wireless networks inherently reliable wired networks wireless networks utilize hop hop data link level order provide early detection retransmission lost corrupted packets 
networks route maintenance easily provided hop host transmitting packet hop determine hop route working 
data link level reports transmission problem recover example maximum number retransmissions willing attempt exceeded host sends route error packet original sender packet encountering error

optimizations number optimizations possible basic operation route discovery route maintenance described section reduce number overhead packets improve average efficiency routes data packets 
section discusses optimizations 

full route cache data host route cache may stored format active routes cache effect form tree routes rooted host hosts ad hoc network 
example shows ad hoc network mobile hosts mobile host earlier completed route discovery mobile host cached route hosts route host learns route hosts route discovery performs route discovery learns route represent route cache addition single new hop learns reach single hop needing go new route shorten routes route cache 
host add entries route cache time learns new route 
particular host forwards data packet intermediate hop route packet forwarding host able observe entire route packet 
example host forwards packets add route information packet route cache 
host forwards route reply packet add route information route record returned route reply route cache 
wireless network transmissions inherently broadcast host may able configure network interface promiscuous receive mode add route cache route information data route reply packet overhear 
host may route cache avoid propagating route request packet received host 
particular suppose host receives route request packet target listed route record packet pair address request id list seen requests host route cache entry target request may append cached route accumulated route record packet may return route route reply packet initiator propagating re broadcasting route request 
example mobile host needs send packet mobile host initiate route discovery broadcast route request packet 
broadcast received simply return route reply packet containing complete route consisting sequence hops andd 
particular problem occur mobile hosts receive initiator broadcast route request packet reply routes route caches 
example receive route request broadcast able reply route caches send replies time received broadcast time 
particularly mobile hosts example involved simultaneous replies mobile hosts receiving broadcast may create packet collisions replies may cause local congestion wireless network 
addition case example ad hoc network illustrating route cache different replies indicate routes different lengths 
example reply indicate route hop longer reply 
avoid problems simultaneous replies attempt eliminate replies indicating routes longer shortest reply causing mobile host delay slightly replying cache 
replying route cache host performs actions 
pick delay period length number network hops route returned host reply random number constant delay introduced hop 

delay transmitting route reply host period 
delay period receive packets host 
packet received host delay period addressed target route discovery target final destination address packet sequence intermediate hops length route packet cancel delay transmit route reply host host may infer initiator route discovery received route reply giving equal better route 
problem occur hosts reply route requests cache formation loop route sent route reply packet 
route record route request contain loop entry route cache set route containing loop concatenation route record entry replying host route cache target may contain loop 
example host route cache entry need initiate route discovery sending packet case immediately reply route cache route form concatenated route sending packets creating loop back order avoid problem host receives route request target request reply cache host discards request route reply contain loop restriction implies host reply cache route host route route recorded route request packet path obtained host route cache 
optimization involving full route cache added ability initiator route request specify request packet maximum number hops packet may propagated 
host near initiator cache entry target route request propagation redundant copies route request avoided initiator explicitly limit request propagation originally sent 
currently ability route discovery follows 
perform route discovery initially send route request hop limit 
refer route request 

route reply received route request small timeout period send new route request hop limit set predefined maximum value assumed useful routes ad hoc network limit currently 
procedure uses hop limit route request packet inexpensively check target currently wireless transmitter range initiator host range route cache entry target effectively caches host neighbors extension cache 
initial request limited network hop timeout period sending propagating request quite small 
mechanism implement expanding ring search target hop limit gradually increased subsequent retransmissions route request target experimented approach 

piggybacking route discoveries described section host needs send packet sender route cached destination host initiate separate route discovery buffering original packet route reply returned discarding relying higher layer protocol retransmit needed 
delay route discovery total number packets transmitted reduced allowing data piggybacked route request packets 
route requests may propagated widely ad hoc network amount data piggybacked limited 
currently piggybacking sending route reply route error packet naturally small size small data packets initial syn packet opening tcp connection easily piggybacked experimented option 
problem arises piggybacking route request packets 
route request received host replied host route cache propagating request section piggybacked data lost host discards route request 
case discarding packet host construct new packet containing piggybacked data route request packet setting route packet route returned route reply 
route appear new packet sent initiator route discovery forwarded normally host portion route taken accumulated route record route request packet remainder route taken host route cache 
sender address packet set initiator route discovery 

reflecting shorter routes hosts communicating cached routes desirable hosts shorter routes hosts move sufficiently closer 
cases basic route maintenance procedure sufficient accomplish hosts moves allow route shortened move transmission range hop existing route 
improvement method reflecting shorter routes possible hosts operate network interfaces promiscuous receive mode 
suppose forwarding packet mobile host transmits packet hop route packet illustrated 
receives packet examine packet header see packet reached hop intended route packet 
case may infer route may shortened exclude intermediate hop sends unsolicited route reply packet original sender packet informing reach hop route reply packets hosts receive route reply particular hosts operating promiscuous receive mode may incorporate change route caches 
believe method ensure shortest routes added method simulator 
mobile host notices route shortened 
improved handling errors common error condition handled ad hoc network case network effectively partitioned 
hosts wish communicate transmission range mobile hosts form sequence hops forward packets 
new route discovery initiated packet sent host situation large number unproductive route request packets propagated subset ad hoc network reachable host 
order reduce overhead route discoveries exponential backoff limit rate new route discoveries may initiated host target 
host attempts send additional data packets host frequently limit subsequent packets may buffered route reply received initiate new route discovery minimum allowable interval new route discoveries target reached 
limitation maximum rate route discoveries target similar mechanism required internet hosts limit rate arp requests sent single ip address 
additional optimization possible improve handling errors promiscuous receive mode allow hosts eavesdrop route error packets sent hosts 
example shows return route error packet mobile host host hosts operating promiscuous receive mode able receive route error packet 
route error packet names ends route hop causing error host receiving error packet update route cache reflect fact hosts indicated packet longer directly communicate 
host receiving route error packet simply search route cache routes hop route route truncated hop 
hosts route hop reachable route subsequent hosts 
possible route error packet returned original sender data packet may take different route sender data packet took point error encountered 
example network environment radio transmission hosts equally directions route discovery host returning route error packet may discover different route back original sender 
hosts may cached route error may able receive route error packet promiscuous receive mode 
situation improved extending handling route error packets route error packet reaches original sender data packet original sender retransmits route error packet back point error path originally data packet path differs received route error packet 
route error mobile host returning route error packet optimization improve handling errors support caching negative information host route cache 
suppose optimizations handling errors 
receives route error packet may initiate route discovery order find new route target 
hosts entry route cache target reply cache cached copy route just removed cache 
enter cache receives route error packet indication hop currently working simply removing hop routes currently cache ignore replies include hop caches 
short expiration period placed negative cached information entry cache refuse allow hop route entries cache hop begins working 
currently included caching negative information simulation due difficulty picking suitable expiration period appears necessary cases hosts receive route error packets 
example receive route error packet removed hop caches new route discovery initiated avoiding problem
