furthermore historical archive search documents relevant particular research problems usually carried researches archive personnel try error manner 
users rely mainly conceptual model archive developed experience past searches tool extent guide automate searches 
important fact hinders search digitized historical archive documents available form electronic text images result full text keyword search available 
consequently essence develop alternative methods providing support users searches environment historical archives 
provides brief overview techniques currently browsing visualizing results historical archives proposes new approach aiming help users performing search providing conceptual model entities archive bridging existing categorization 
second section describes methods browsing historical archives digital libraries general third section describes proposed approach generic framework searching viewing documents specifically historical archives 
fourth section summarizes key points taken consideration implementation outlines research aims 
information retrieval methods digital libraries historical archives considered special case library documents contained product activities entity organization person 
historical archive digitized methods provided support functionality needed digital archive usually similar ones digital libraries 
day research field user interfaces digital library systems developed great variety proposals document search visualization results 
widely solution web search engines input keywords results document list may contain hundreds results divided pages 
browsing hierarchies accomplished multi level lists 
user may view contents category selecting 
methods offer effective ways presentation results 
consequently efforts visualizations represent efficiently search results facilitate hierarchy browsing 
presentations graphs visualize documents points space order provide overview results keyword search 
axes defined certain preselected document characteristics provide query formulation area various tools aid keyword search 
hand systems represent hierarchies order facilitate browsing large document spaces 
techniques employ similar point click navigation method suitable browsing visual representation document space 
example offer sophisticated query formulation area may represent hierarchies form zoomable table technique called allowing user navigate hierarchical data 
visualizations hyperbolic browser graphs order group results hierarchies 
alternative way represent hierarchy nested colored areas rectangular surfaces tree map disks information slices technique circular

ontology historical archive visualized effectively valuable tool browsing exchanging information users 
proposed approach ontology tool integral part historical archive digital visualization system 
various theories developed suggesting basic features facilities visualization system order usable effective 
shneiderman presents high level tasks information visualization application support overview gain overview entire collection 
overview strategies include zoomed views data type see entire collection plus adjoining detail view context plus focus display 
zoom zoom items interest 
users typically interest portion collection need tools enable control zoom focus zoom factor 
filter filter uninteresting items 
allowing users control contents display users quickly focus interests eliminating unwanted items
