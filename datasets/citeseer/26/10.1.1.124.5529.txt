gerald chao infocious gerald infocious com junghoo cho ucla computer science cho cs ucla edu local repository increasing web 
user issues query search engines go enormous repository identify relevant documents user query 
current major web search engines process identifying relevant documents typically involves matching keywords user query documents local repository 
web page considered relevant query simply contain query keywords 
particular approach worked serving users needs 
queries simple keyword matching suffice 
example consider single keyword query jaguar user issue search engine 
time writing major search engines return results deal disjoint issues jaguar car brand name jaguar latest version macos jaguar animal 
imagine highly user interested time 
query jaguar example ambiguous query associated multiple senses pertaining different topic interest 
consequence web pages distinct topics share keywords considered relevant user 
resolving ambiguities long study field called natural language processing nlp briefly review section 
infocious new web search engine built primary goal improving users search experience reducing ambiguities linguistic analysis 
infocious applies linguistic analysis major ways 
language analysis infocious resolves ambiguities content web pages 
currently infocious focuses types ambiguity part speech ambiguity phrasal ambiguity topical ambiguity 
ambiguities resolved infocious provides precise searching enables users locate information seek quickly accurately 

second language analysis done contributes ranking results user 
high level see rating coherence quality text 
improve ranking search results promoting written content rich documents conversely lower quality text 
building infocious encountered various issues challenges applying nlp web searching including scalability efficiency usability robustness 
sections discuss lessons experiences applying language analysis helping people find information web 

benefits nlp web searching main goal natural language processing nlp field understand process information exchange humans communicate natural languages 
better understanding process allow computers extract operate information knowledge represented natural languages reliable fashion 
field nlp long rich history encompassing linguistics computer science psychology neuroscience 
years variety approaches methodologies better resolve ambiguities extract semantics natural language text 
goal build nlp create better web search experience users 
task focus statistical datadriven techniques experienced surge progress decade 
reason choice threefold 
data driven nlp requires minimal human effort creating statistical models 
particularly important case web scale processing voluminous dynamic nature web content 
second statistical models robust sense generate interpretation regardless input 
paramount importance coping heterogeneous unpredictable nature web 
third statistical models currently accurate resolving ambiguities natural language text primary task main challenge nlp 
common types language ambiguity show statistical nlp approach resolving 
addition discuss web search benefit resolving ambiguities 
part speech disambiguation consider web page contains words house plants 
depending context phrase may multiple interpretations 
example web page may plants inside house may objects methods house plants 
difference meaning comes fact case word house noun second case verb 
search engine keyword matching able distinguish cases returned results contain mix uses 
part speech pos disambiguation process assigning part speech tag noun verb adjective word sentence 
assigning pos tags word determine word functions context 
doing determine house noun verb previous example 
search engine exploit pos tagging information restricting query keywords particular pos tag providing results specific desired meaning query 
word sense disambiguation cases words take multitude different meanings senses 
words called polysemous 
example word jaguar may refer car brand name operating system animal 
task distinguishing meanings polysemous word called word sense disambiguation wsd 
having word senses disambiguated allow users search specific sense word eliminating documents containing keyword semantically irrelevant 
macos version scientific name 
phrase identification multiple words typically grouped phrases describe concept precisely 
individual words overloaded multiple usages meanings phrases important describing concept precisely 
example phrases motor oil cooking oil words motor cooking describe specific type oil 
phrases simply words occurring 
take example sentence profession cooking oil important ingredient cooking oil form phrase 
search engine consider sentence relevant phrase cooking oil 
general order properly identify phrases necessary perform linguistic analysis broader context 
named entity recognition named entities refer names people companies locations dates 
recognizing difference jordan person versus country process named entity recognition ner 
search engine capable distinguishing different types name entities enable users search specifically person country example 
ner extract particular named entities interest user companies locations mentioned business article people mentioned newsletter 
full sentential parsing parsing process decomposing sentence smaller units identifying grammatical role relationship units 
parsing studied problem grammar formalisms parsing algorithms 
parsing important extracting semantics sentences precisely 
consider example sentence man bought shares apple fell 
case parser able determine bought shares apple modifier man man fell 
case simple keyword matching article may returned result query shares apple fell 
additionally parsing enable precise searches allow user specify queries subjects apple subject main verbs bought main verb combinations linguistic units 
especially powerful structural constructs express semantics man owns apple shares fell 
brief overview common types language ambiguities 
interested readers may refer comprehensive treatment subject 
section approach taken infocious address ambiguities just discussed 

linguistic analysis web text task applying linguistic analysis improve web searching involves main challenges 
comes massive scale diversity web content making issues efficiency robustness paramount 
second exploit linguistic analysis best benefit user
