bisecting means bisecting means algorithm starts single cluster documents works manner 
pick cluster split 

find sub clusters basic means algorithm 

repeat step bisecting step fixed number times take split produces clustering highest similarity 
cluster similarity average pairwise document similarity seek minimize sum clusters 

repeat steps desired number clusters reached 
little difference possible methods selecting cluster split chose split largest remaining cluster

results shown 

agglomerative hierarchical clustering performs poorly distinguishes documents different classes frequency words 
furthermore document subset words complete vocabulary 
probabilistic nature words distributed documents may share words 
expect documents nearest neighbors belonging class 
cases nearest neighbors document different classes agglomerative clustering put documents class cluster earliest stages clustering process 
way hierarchical clustering works mistakes fixed happen 
cases nearest neighbors unreliable different approach needed relies global properties 
issue discussed non document context 
computing cosine similarity document cluster centroid computing average similarity document cluster documents means implicitly making global property approach
