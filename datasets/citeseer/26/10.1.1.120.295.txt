challenge reliability expect paramount concern occupants developers smart home technologies reliability 
range domestic technologies home today televisions telephones washing machines microwave large exceedingly reliable devices great complexity 
modern digital television set top box example contains number specialized microprocessors devoted high bandwidth decompression cryptography rendering network communications back service provider 
devices virtually crash desktop computer systems 
achieving expected levels reliability especially coupled ad hoc devices may expected smart homes great challenge 
dealing challenge depends understanding reasons devices reliable traditional desktop software systems 
reasons include differences development culture differences technological approaches differences expectations market differences regulations development cultures domestic technologies differ widely desktop general purpose computing systems 
embedded systems developers tended wary systems crashes unwieldy patch upgrade device field 
washing machine vendor example fold recall products upgrades traditional software vendors issue patches 
course reliable software systems exist 
kinds systems give insight may take reliable ubiquitous technologies home 
telephone switches illustrate example lucent technologies keith edwards rebecca grinter ess maintains reliability goal seconds downtime year 
meeting reliability goal means regular upgrades ones provide occupant users new services performed switch processing calls 
words reliability requirement manifests system architecture 
parts system monitoring events lead downtime fixing reporting appropriate 
designing reliability requires devoting substantial time resources affect system architecture 
practices integrated development cultures build smart home technology 
second difference technological approaches taken domestic technology developers desktop market

digital television systems likewise place bulk functionality network client side device 
utility approach client technologies shielded upgrades enhancements network take advantage new functionality available 
significant note embedding intelligence network precisely counter approaches taken developers technologies intelligence resides edges network 
ubiquitous computing applications design challenge determining kind balance intelligence maintain edges center network 
additionally technological approaches taken designers account need degrade gracefully 
mean component richly interconnected system fails bring rest system 
traditionally systems achieved ability degrade gracefully redundancy data services replicated available multiple machines 
approach may trade goals simplicity intelligibility ease administration requirements domestic technologies 
address tension challenge system designers 
third difference simply expectations various marketplaces 
consumers expect appliances crash unfortunately developed tolerance crashes general purpose computing systems 
reliability technologies allowed consumer forget complex technical entities 
hardly thinks administering phone configuring television 
large part technologies blend home part fabric home 
crashing phones televisions setting 
expectations vigorously reinforced publications organizations exist identify reliable technologies uncover

challenge inference presence ambiguity systems machine processing control assist human behavior long track record history computer science 
examples systems come domains disparate workflow tools force users formal patterns microsoft office assistant attempts actions user offer help 
literature ubiquitous computing depicts machine inference human state intent crucial factor benefits environments bring 
example literature posits smart meeting rooms share notes participants telephone calls follow intended recipients building 
clearly examples dependent simply detecting acting knowledge state world sensor inputs examples presumption system correctly infer user left devices 
begs question just smart smart home 
inference required environments successful 
benefits achieved limited inference inference 
absence oracular artificial intelligence design environments occupants models expect homes fix results interpretations gone bad 
constant published visions ubiquitous computing computing employed physical space bring functions users everyday systems degree aware surroundings users 
physical world course termed highly keith edwards rebecca grinter analog environment presenting great deal ambiguity uncertainty input greater domain 
intelligence world take number forms greater assumptions 
obvious include environment interpret meaning sensor data reflect state world 
example system assume am room active badge room 
environment infer state exists aggregating number factors 
example number people gathered meeting room system assume meeting place 
environment may attempt infer intent view state world 
example system assume am meeting want share meeting notes meeting 
system may preemptively act assumptions intent 
example system assumes may want share meeting notes may go ahead available meeting participants ask 
modes intelligence represented literature ubiquitous computing see similar categorization 
subject error varying degrees types 
example simple sensing case may report am room simply left active badge desk 
called phenomenological problems sensors reflect reality merely state sensors likelihood largely overcome better sensor technology cost privacy user control 
importantly cost incorrect inferences low system little inferred information 
dramatic problems apparent uncertain inferences decisions compounded 
troubling attempt inferring internal human intent action especially inference layers ambiguous interpretation input requires level intelligence humans find difficult 
challenge discern functions smart home possible limited inference possible inference require oracle 
category comprises candidates implementation limited machine interpretation means limited possibility error 
third category systems require omniscient understanding human intent order function better abandoned 
middle category feel interesting presents important problems design technology 
systems rely inference right time users necessarily models system arrives 
models concern actual rules inference people gather living room display television schedule capabilities system sensors system know living room place 
home ubiquitous computing challenges users know expect homes way say user knows dropping temperature outside cause thermostat turn heating 
predictability depends system expected behavior face condition known 
system facilities detecting inferring condition known 
provision user override system behavior 
achieving conditions complicated inferences system complex basic sensing unreliable open interpretation 
challenge smart home designers create systems ensure users understand pragmatics sensors interpretation machine action understand pragmatics devices homes 
technical perspective challenge developers ensure ambiguity hidden parts system users need access ensure inference performed done way predictable intelligible recoverable 
discussion challenges ubiquitous computing research home setting 
divided challenges purposes discussion clearly interesting connections overlap 
number problems arise unique smart home setting 
existing houses designed smart office technologies intended just technologies office home 
realities home setting coupled fact adoption home technologies incremental disjoint foreseeable give rise fourth challenges 
second believe host technical implementation systems design issues underestimated 
importantly tradeoffs issues understood home setting 
stringent requirements reliability fact formal systems administrator want undertake role desire interoperability trade 
example relatively easy easily administered reliable device device needs communicate services home 
believe finding right balance requirements crucial 
third social impact new technologies hard predict 
home setting novel respect social dynamics relationships home volatile setting office public spaces 
believe overarching philosophical question addressed designers smart home technology simply smart smart home provide utility occupant owners 
degree keith edwards rebecca grinter question raised precisely smart home disruptive domestic order gives rise architectural implementation tradeoffs mentioned social adoption technology unpredictable
