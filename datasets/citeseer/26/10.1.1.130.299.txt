modeling image dataset statistics model generative hierarchical model inspired proposed text hofmann 
model hierarchical combination clustering model maps documents clusters symmetric clustering model models joint distribution documents features aspect model 
data modeled generated fixed hierarchy nodes leaves hierarchy corresponding clusters 
node tree probability generating word similarly node probability generating image segment features 
documents belonging cluster modeled generated nodes path leaf corresponding cluster root node node weighted document cluster basis 
conceptually document belongs specific cluster finite data model probability document belongs cluster essentially clusters soft 
note clusters insufficient membership extinguished branches root may prematurely

clusters consideration document modeled sum clusters weighted probability document cluster 
mathematically process generating set observations associated document described pd pc pi cd indexes clusters indexes items words image segments indexes levels 
note hard hierarchy cluster level specify node 
words equation describes weighted sum aspects tied parameters force hierarchical structure 
aspects model joint distribution documents items weighting pl cd function document 
encounter new document re fit model estimate pl cd cluster specific approximation generally works cheaper compute 
probabilities item pi lc conditionally independent node tree 
node uniquely specified cluster level 
case word pi lc simply tabulated determined appropriate word counts training 
image segments gaussian distributions number features capturing aspects size position colour texture shape 
features taken form feature vector node subscripted cluster level specifies probability distribution image segments usual formula exp cl cl det cl assume independence features learning full covariance matrix leads precision problems 
reasonable compromise enforce block diagonal structure covariance matrix capture important dependencies 
train model expectation maximization algorithm 
involves introducing hidden variables indicating training document dc cluster indicating item document dil generated level additional details em equations 
chose hierarchical model possibilities best supports browsing large collections images 
furthermore information document shared higher level nodes representation compact similar non hierarchical 
economy exactly model trained appropriately 
specifically general terms generic image segment descriptions occur higher level nodes occur 
course assumes loose definition general 
example word removed free text descriptions images treated general term 
mention implementation details relevant scalability avoiding training 
training procedure described cluster images hours state art pc 
resource requirements notably memory increase rapidly number images going significantly requires extra care 
experimented approaches 
approach train randomly selected subset images log likelihood held data randomly selected remaining data begins drop 
model starting point training round second randomly selected set images 
method helps avoid training reducing resource usage 
second method reducing resource usage limit cluster membership 
compute approximate clustering training subset 
cluster entire dataset maintain probability point cluster top clusters 
rest membership probabilities assumed zero iterations point top clusters re estimated 
experimented clustering reduced tree depth get approximate clusterings 

testing basic model tested method stability running fitting process number times data different initial conditions em process known sensitive starting point 
resulting clusterings similar character numerical tests showed exact structure fact somewhat sensitive starting point 
important test reran experiment hid percentage data percent training process 
interestingly little effect variance cluster process 
conclude clustering process depends significantly starting point exact images chosen training 
general test verify clustering image segment features text advantage 
shows images cluster text shows images image features shows images adjacent clusters text features 
cluster text contains images related word ocean category contains fair variety images 
consists visually similar images combined red coral red flowers 
hand broken ocean images visual lines separating images significant amounts red coral ones predominantly blue 
shows breakdown lost words shows semantics lost image features 
reason clustering text image segment features generally appropriate simply people relate images semantic visual content 
example may interested pictures flowers may interested predominantly red flowers 
attribute red added keyword meaning inherent image 
combined text feature strategy hierarchical system images associated word flowers may broken associated clusters predominantly red flowers predominantly yellow flowers predominantly green garden scenes 
combined clustering approach best important pragmatic reason 
browsing results clustering image segment features verifies provide semantic coherence 
reasonable expect image features provide semantic coherence available words 
similarly clustering text yields visual coherence reasonable expect capture visual similarity goes capacity feature set especially face segmentation errors 

browsing image retrieval systems support browsing difficult define implement 
systems force user specify looking query 
help user learn kind images 
setting image databases content easy internalize navigate difficult normally involves human input 
goals automate task 
key issue browsing clusters sense user 
user finds clusters coherent internalize kind structure represent 
furthermore small portion cluster represent accurately suggest kinds pictures exploring cluster 
posit important test browsing suitability clusters sense humans 

images ocean theme cluster clustering text 
cluster contains images clusters red mixed general ocean pictures 
investigate question set experiment 
clustered roughly corel images clusters 
additional random clusters generated images 
random clusters matched size randomly selected true clusters 
sets combined clusters non example cluster image features 
coral images visually similar flower images 
clearly semantics lost grouping semantic categories interesting 

adjacent clusters computed text image segments 
words clearly help ensure consistency ocean underwater themes making clusters neighboring leaves tree 
image segment features clustering promotes visual similarly images clusters ensures red coral separated ocean scenes generally quite blue 
clusters randomly interspersed 
subject asked view clusters say candidate cluster sufficient coherence considered coherent unit 
definition coherence left subject subject aware semantics visual content play role occasional anomaly necessarily mean cluster rated non cluster coherence adequate 
subject able separate classes accuracy 
conclude clusters sufficient coherence useful browsing 
specifically presentation small subset cluster thumbnails indicate user region data worth exploring 

search second important facility image databases retrieval user queries 
wish support queries text image features 
queries soft sense combinations items taken consideration documents item considered 
queries easily specified images 
approach searching compute probability candidate image emitting query items 
defining search computation probabilities naturally yields appealing soft query system 
example query corel images image tiger river get reasonable result despite fact words appear single image 
river clusters water possibly helped image segment features number images interest high probability query 
shows top results river tiger query 
set query items candidate document express probability document produces query pq pq pq cd pc documents high score returned user 
second approach find probabilities query generated cluster sample clusters weighted probability cluster emits query 
works reasonably cluster membership plays dominant role broad trees generating documents simply reflects fact clusters coherent 
results significantly better rarely worse 
implemented search arbitrary combinations words image features 
purposes experimentation specify features simply selecting segments available data 
results river tiger query 
words tiger river appear 
tiger pictures ones word water tend get selected river water appear training set 
applies segments similar ones cooccur word river training 
features selected segments 
clearly providing flexible method specifying image features important step 
part system employ user selection features suggested returned result set 
explored query example image retrieval systems 
strategy emphasize system retrieve images starting example image 
captures users needs ways 
put differently query dog word dog want blue sky dog add appropriate segment feature query 
working pieces images required 

pictures words words pictures search strategy build application takes text selected document suggests images go text 
application essentially process linking pictures words 
clear symmetry just easily go way link words pictures 
auto annotate process interesting number reasons 
image produce reasonable words existing text search infrastructure broaden searches confines system 
example consider image search user sketch 
sketch contains orange ball upper right corner segment associated words sun sunset text query engines automatically consulted interesting images words having indexed feature 
images analyzed detail

examples chosen descend accuracy excellent top poor bottom 
flower examples similar large colorful segments provide significant cue 
case blobs show affinity ones non flower clusters 
prediction word reflection correct image available keywords illustrates method finesse difficult problems

performance measure study things tree topology data pre processing compromises scalability training parameters word segment vocabulary selection discussed 
possible problem facing application general datasets may words vocabulary relevance visual content 
best words cause random noise doing take away probability words relevant 
words culled standard words leave words 
example word name person catalogued image 
words removed observing emission probabilities spread nodes 
automatic vocabulary reduction method sense depends nature data set

serious difficulty attaching words pictures relies semantically meaningful segmentation 
segmentations general images available near 
method works healthy amount data segmentations words sufficiently correlated segment features 
words segments just add noise 
example expect data able learn relationship orange ball upper half image word sun 
hand surprise words actual corel keyword reliably predicted 
simply obvious human pictures rarely segmented 
general segments useful 
analysis compelling model identify words image segments related data 
possible information improve training process 
example word predicted image segments may best remove training 
apply image segments 
segment predicted associated words culled data set
