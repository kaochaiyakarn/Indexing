fourth privacy risk model consistent complete 
mean different project teams existing privacy literature terms data subjects data owners data collectors data users 
data sharers data observers adversarial connotations 
arrive answer 
team unique biases perspectives insights 
mean starting set questions 
designers may find useful add remove questions depending community users intended domain 
fifth privacy risk model addresses relatively security issues 
conjunction security threat model ensure desired privacy needs properly implemented secured 
examine questions depth describing kinds information question looking important examples 
social organizational context users system 
step privacy risk model identify potential users 
important step community users different attitudes privacy risk sharing personal information 
example system intended friends share location information different privacy needs similar system intended workers system real time monitoring health system personal information publicly available web 
important identify intended data observers system significant factor data sharer willing share personal information indicated adams privacy multimedia spaces lederer managing user privacy ubiquitous computing environments 
suggests data sharers range people willing share different types degrees personal information 
extremely difficult enumerate possible usage scenario focus users affected system average cases 
question focus non malicious data observers people may intrude privacy necessarily wish harm data sharer mother 
kinds personal information shared 
question looks shared shared 
enumerating kinds information shared circumstances shared helps identify potential privacy risks suggests ways managed 
example anonymity frequently touted panacea protecting privacy 
friends family know great deal individual name address phone number hobbies preferences 
point underscores issue think personal information known relationship 
family members know name address example sense family oriented application provide strong protection pieces information way approaching question look technology 
example active badges kinds information shared location course exceptions example husband abusive wife trying hide :10.1.1.13.8168
depending scope scale application may useful add ways hiding 
approximation activity 
marx presents alternative analysis listing types identity knowledge characterize people 
know person name legal name name person address mailing address email address homepage blog instant messenger address unique identifier social security number bank account number names pseudonyms easily traced example disposable identifier anonymous hiv testing person appearance behavior example web browsing habits fashion style writing style person social categorization including gender ethnicity religion age education region sexual orientation linguistic patterns organizational memberships classifications health status employment leisure activities credit risk iq sat scores life style categorization mass marketing person relationship love dislike services 
suggests people different sensitivity different kinds information 
example domestic romantic financial information social security numbers things people may comfortable sharing compared marketing information bad experiences jokes stories opinions 
notes 
useful consider ubicomp changes identified 
capturing physical world information real time ubiquitous computing greatly allows knowledge inference person person doing people currently 
second useful note information explicitly versus implicitly shared 
active badge example data sharer explicitly sharing location implicitly sharing notion activity 
knowing person office suggests working attempting appear 
third useful note data changes 
example person name birthday fairly static normally change 
person preferences habits change relatively slowly 
person location activity dynamic change quite 
important distinction privacy protection techniques certain kinds data 
example individual revoke access name birthday information expect meaningful effect location activity information 
value proposition sharing 
question looks reasons data sharers share personal information 
strong value proposition data sharers may feel compelling reason share information exposes risk benefit 
ways considered variation grudin law informally states benefit technology fail subverted 
privacy corollary share personal information benefit technology fail 
example seen nurse locator systems 
hospitals nurses wear active badges allowing hospital track location nurses efficiency accountability purposes 
interesting comments nurse message board systems divided groups 
group forming majority comments skeptical locator systems cases rejected systems making arguments think degrading guess question help nurse second group nurses initially skeptical won management abuse system eventually saw value system 
nurse wrote admit started reasons cited message board think 
frustrating floats unit doesn tracker find doctor calls patient needs nurse echoed sentiment writing various reasons felt couldn take bathroom break knowing requests medications go right nurse go 
tied get reminder page take care pts needs 
just love locator system thinking privacy perspective value proposition helps explain proposed deployment rfid systems united states england see example 
store perspective benefited tags tracking inventory maintaining steady supply chains 
customer perspective data sharers exposed risk surreptitious tracking salient benefit 
surprising people serious privacy concerns 
relationships data sharers data observers 
question looks identifying kinds relationships users important understanding level trust potential risks incentives protecting data sharer personal information obligations mechanisms recourse 
example close friend strong motivation say sell data sharer personal information 
kinds concerns relationship simple wanting complex going friend mutually liked 
mechanism recourse asking data observer 
example person paid service market legal relationship 
large majority cases data sharer probably wants avoid spam 
data sharer discovers privacy violation mechanisms recourse include opting service provides web page doing switching alternative service service 
define levels relationships specific general 
specific relationship defines data sharer data observer knows see table 
examples include family friends 
general relationship describes class relationship 
framework market social legal forces roughly categorize relationships 
specific relationship general relationship family social friends social acquaintances social weak strangers social weak legal social weak employer market legal social weak moderate workers social weak moderate legal companies market legal table 
example relationships categorization 
malicious data observers 
useful think malicious data observers kinds personal information interested 
data observers identified previously data observers data sharer best interests mind 
example stalker intrusive journalist interested location specific person 
spammer interested email address person 
interested location person 
helpful think question security perspective privacy perspective data sharer voluntarily share personal information people oblivious risk misunderstand application works 
example malicious observers obtain personal information 
stakeholders 
question looks stakeholders impacted system purposefully inadvertently 
example place lab project goal provide inexpensive large scale location positioning system 
place lab uses wide deployment wifi access points determining location 
key observation developed areas wireless hotspot coverage dense cells overlap 
consulting place lab directories continuously map unique addresses wireless hotspot physical locations mobile computers pdas equipped wifi determine location city block 
advantage approach provides privacy sensitive way determining location hotspots detected passive manner revealing information entities 
place lab introduces new privacy risks access point owners re purposes system originally meant wireless communication 
place lab location access points widely available posing potential privacy risk owners 
access point owners stakeholders system privacy considered 
technology personal information collected 
question looks technological mechanisms personal information captured ubiquitous computing systems 
example person activity estimated motion sensors video cameras monitors framework consists market social legal technical forces dropped technical form relationship technology means form relationship 
installed computer 
approaches different tradeoffs terms quality information collected privacy 
respect location systems general approaches acquiring location 
network approach infrastructure receivers cell towers track cellular mobile transmitting units 
approach includes techniques computer vision personal information initially captured computers outside control data sharer 
network assisted approach infrastructure works clients calculate location 
example qualcomm enhanced solution uses receive raw gps satellite data sent network processors calculation 
client approach personal mobile devices autonomously compute position case gps unit 
general client approaches offer strongest privacy guarantees personal information starts data sharers information revealed entities data sharers choose 
network approaches may sufficient depending community users intended domain 
personal information shared 
question looks choices data sharers sharing personal information 
assume data sharers know personal information captured choice shared 
case ways share information 
push information example sending location information call 
second pull information example friend requesting location 
general fewer privacy risks respect push applications personal information transferred data sharers initiate transaction 
downside may flexible certain kinds applications example notified person enters building 
information shared 
question looks quantity information shared data observers 
extreme data observers see time snapshots dynamic information 
see continuous real time information 
general greater amount information subject data mining inferences potentially exposes data sharers greater privacy risks 
suggested jiang principle minimum asymmetry fair information practices general rule thumb applications designed minimum amount information needed shared 
important consider degree reciprocity disclosure 
quality information shared 
question looks quality information respect space time identity 
general lower quality information shared fewer privacy risks data sharer 
terms space application designed precise form location data sharer choose share location level 
example knowing person th street exposes individual different risks different opportunities knowing chicago 
terms time application designed restrict personal information shared temporal granularity lake tahoe month versus tahoe july temporal freshness location information week old current location 
terms identity applications designed precise forms identity 
significant difference smart room senses person versus woman alice blah com inside room 
marx different forms identification especially useful 
general kinds identity dictated capabilities limitations underlying technology 
general rule thumb useful require minimum amount information needed minimize potential privacy risks individuals 
long information retained 
limited retention personal information issue explicitly mentioned fair information practices 
danger retention exposes data sharers unexpected risks data mining data date 
judgment call precisely long personal information retained fair information practices provide guidance 
personal information retained time necessary fulfill initial purpose information collected 
privacy risk management second part privacy risk model looks privacy risk management takes unordered list privacy risks privacy risk analysis prioritizes helps design teams identify solutions helping users manage issues technical solutions social processes means 
privacy risk management concept reasonable care law degree care sense prudent 
known legal ruling learned hand proposed cost benefit analysis considers factors determining reasonable care respect assigning liability 
adapt hand factors managing privacy likelihood unwanted disclosure personal information occurs damage happen disclosure cost adequate privacy protection suggest qualitative assessment high medium low help gauge factors design teams may find useful numerical scale quantify values 
general situations ld risk damage unwanted disclosure outweigh costs protection suggest privacy protections implemented 
words design teams provide reasonable level privacy protection prohibitive build deploy application significantly reduces utility application 
example agre provides analysis known caller id notes callers default protecting level privacy callers little value callee service 
design teams enumerate potential privacy risks privacy risk analysis assign values risk prioritize risks choose ones address determine solutions address 
caveats 
approach expresses factors taken account 
values factors judgment calls best knowledge design team severity rating heuristic evaluation 
second approach address extreme cases respect privacy 
looks risks foreseeable significant expectation design teams design applications protect obvious kinds risks 
third estimation damage take account scale potential damage 
example different level damage system stored personal information dozen individuals compromised compared stored personal information thousands individuals 
fourth estimation cost take account burden design team user 
infeasible design team example deploy version web browser cookies privacy sensitive web sites web browsers current version cookies 
better done internet community single group designers 
similarly unrealistic require data sharer options correctly new device manner 
better done design team 
important note utility cost benefit analysis comes accurate precise values having design team think issues likelihood damage cost coming solutions mitigating helping users managing risk 
prioritizing privacy risks likelihood damage useful think manage risks 
series questions help potential solutions 
managing privacy risks unwanted disclosure take place 
accident example hitting wrong button 
misunderstanding example data sharer thinks doing thing system 
malicious disclosure 
choice control awareness data sharers personal information 
kinds control feedback mechanisms data sharers give choice control awareness 
mechanisms simple understandable 
privacy policy communicated data sharers 
default settings 
defaults useful preserving privacy 
cases easier important cost effective prevent unwanted disclosures abuses 
detect disclosures abuses 
ways data sharers maintain plausible deniability 
mechanisms recourse recovery unwanted disclosure abuse personal information 
discuss questions 
unwanted disclosure take place 
issue consider unwanted disclosure happens suggests different ways addressing issue 
example accident hitting wrong button suggests revised user interface may needed 
misunderstanding lines mismatched mental model suggests user interface needs provide better feedback 
maliciously exploited disclosure probably needs better detection mechanisms ways preventing disclosure 
choice control awareness data sharers 
question looks data sharers interact understand system 
common interaction design issues including providing useful usable controls example invisible mode messenger applications option turn system providing useful feedback overwhelming example simple notifications 
useful think privacy policies service designed policies communicated data sharers 
existing interaction design patterns may useful patterns exist example having privacy policy link bottom web page 
default settings 
previous research suggests users change application settings defaults :10.1.1.18.1545
important ensure defaults right majority cases level personal information shared excessive 
original parctab system negative example data sharer location visible default 
better prevent unwanted disclosures detect 
cases better prevent disclosures especially potential damage high 
cases may easier detect unwanted disclosures 
describes example respect medical emergencies hospitals calls optimistic access control :10.1.1.17.477
observation unforeseen situations predicted 
cases flexibility important may useful allow greater access better auditing detecting 
words better users ask permission 
grudin horvitz argued cases approach easier people understand manage 
demonstrates example optimistic access control find friends application 
data sharer sets buddy list lists friends request current location 
data sharer friends request informed data sharer get notification request 
approach provides form social visibility cases sufficient prevent abuses 
key factors probability unwanted disclosure subsequent damage 
cases values relatively low example environments high level trust detecting errors may better approach 
ways data sharers maintain plausible deniability 
plausible deniability powerful mechanism maintaining social relationships 
example mobile phones 
person answer mobile phone call technical reasons outside service range having phone phone social reasons busy wanting talk caller right 
result person called simple model protecting privacy caller tell person answering 
mechanisms recourse recovery 
question looks happens unwanted disclosure personal information 
issue consider options data sharer recourse data sharer aware options design team facilitate options 
framework technical market social legal forces 
examples technical recourse include blocking data observer providing invisible mode going web page changing incorrect option 
example market recourse switching service 
example social recourse asking 
example legal recourse sue offending party 
important issue consider data sharer aware unwanted disclosure occurred 
notification log describing information went negative side effect spam 
coming solution useful consider data sharer cares personal information disclosed 
cases disclosure simply annoyance serious risk discovering data sharer shopping 
useful consider possibility avoid designing engineering system 
privacy risk model section describe case studies privacy risk model outlined developing privacy sensitive ubiquitous computing systems 
case studies lo fi prototypes interviews help inform design 
case study location enhanced instant messenger application combines wireless find friends feature instant 
data sharer single buddy list choose share location buddy list status message ex 
home near soda hall allow freely query current location manner similar find friends 
data sharers invisible mode prevent data observers seeing 
abbreviated privacy risk analysis design 
users 
users people willing share snapshots location information significant family friends possibly workers 
service provider third party data observer 
kinds personal information shared 
data observers able see closest place roughly city block level data sharer location 
relationships data sharers data observers 
user choose share location common relationships social ones relatively high level trust 
application environments trust levels quite high 
main concerns monitoring 
information shared 
data sharers share location discrete time manner 
data observers repeatedly query location informed data sharers see requests 
kind notification awareness parties creates social backpressure prevent kinds abuses 
personal information collected shared 
location information collected personal device gps access point beacons 
location initially captured privacy sensitive manner 
malicious data observers 
potential malicious observers include abusive spouses spammers 
large extent malicious observers managed location information starts data sharer data sharer explicitly data observer buddy list data sharer gets notification time location information requested 
analysis believe privacy risks monitoring family friends example mother overly concerned young monitoring workers supervisor malicious person stalker interests space examine risk family friends 
likelihood happening vary significantly depending individual data sharer 
probably better err conservative side assign likelihood value high 
damage occur embarrassment annoyance immediate danger safety assign damage value medium 
look risks managed 
choice control awareness data sharers 
data sharers set status invisible offline online 
offline means exiting entire application 
online data sharer complete access functionality application 
invisible mode means data sharers see online buddies online buddies see data sharers 
significant events requesting buddy location received location requests stored history logs 
mechanisms recourse recovery 
data sharer ask directly repeatedly querying data sharer location 
data sharer remove buddy buddy list preventing person retrieving location information 
buddy list invisible mode notifications fairly simple implement assign cost value low 
high likelihood medium damage low cost 
cost low relative potential risk suggests features 
note difficult estimate accurate values especially wide range users contexts 
argue far better design team consider issues best judgment discuss reasonable doing 
complemented analysis interviews low fi prototypes people help inform risk analysis provide greater understanding potential privacy concerns system 
interviewees concerned location misinterpreted 
example student go caf meet study 
common concern monitoring friends family 
participants worried location constantly checked 
participant concern girlfriend application get suspicious 
time primary concern social pressures created system choosing authorize ignore 
online buddies equal access location participant noted hard say authorizing people mean 
get long list people don want friends regret put invisible 
just created lo fi prototypes location enhanced messenger tested users 
evaluation revealed potential users view location feature separate normal mode instant messaging 
safe communicate random strangers instant messenger true respect location 
analysis done implemented prototype location enhanced instant messenger currently running user studies understand people understanding management privacy risks involved 
case study bears emergency response service enhanced lets users share location dispatchers making emergency calls mobile phones 
location transmitted dispatchers call 
advantages downside discrete push system 
easy ways getting person current known location known emergencies example earthquake building fire kidnapping 
bears system developing handle cases 
tensions balance 
hand want location information highly available case emergencies 
hand emergencies rare want guarantees location information exclusively emergencies purposes 
bears works having trusted third party store location information case emergency 
third party friend paid service business model predicated providing location information event emergencies 
services exist respect medical information best known 
services significant market incentive location information stated purposes possibly legal obligation 
shows example bears buildings keep track building emergency response purposes 
data sharer obtains location 
sends location trusted third party gives named links back data multiple links eliminate unique identifiers data sharer wishes 
data sharer share link building 
case emergencies link traversed known location information retrieved 

example setup bears emergency response service 
data sharer obtains location shares trusted third party 
user gets link sent case building 
emergency responders traverse known links getting upto date information building trusted third party notifying data sharers happened 
abbreviated privacy risk analysis bears users system 
data sharers people need share location emergency response personnel 
data observers trusted third party deployments bears building emergency responders 
relationships data sharers data observers 
paid service scenario individuals market legal relationship bears service 
depending kind building individuals market legal social relationship owners building 
malicious data observers 
potential malicious observers include spammers 
knew data sharer bears malicious observer contact trusted third party act emergency responders obtain authorization location information 
information shared 
trusted third party gets continuous updates data sharer location 
information disclosed emergency responder trusted third party authorized 
personal information stored 
location information stored third party server inaccessible authorized release 
building emergency occurred link points data sharer location trusted third party 
choice control awareness data sharers 
setting service data sharers choose want proxy trusted third party 
data sharer enters building emergency response service choose activate activate time activate bears service 
analysis identify privacy risks malicious observer emergency get location information false emergency location building interests space examine privacy risk 
serious concern undermines location information emergency response purposes 
likelihood happening quite high damage high data sharer trusted third party 
interviews people previous case study helped inform analysis 
interviewees pointed concerns noted potential improperly emergency situation 
interviewees indicated strong desire system worried government authorities purposes 
participant asked authorities watch minute issue partially addressed fact opt data sharers voluntarily choose 
building server controls bears determines situation emergency 
evaluation lo fi prototype participant echoed sentiment want control information sent predominantly prevention disclosure malicious data observers main solution 
way managing risks provide better mechanisms ensure authorized emergency responders see location information 
example setup accept phone calls hospitals identified advance 
imagine similar situation bears phone call police station fire station allow disclosure location information 
furthermore strong social relationship existed data sharer third party third party sign legal agreement disclose personal information emergency purposes 
argued privacy risk models way refining privacy concept set concrete concerns specific domain community users 
introduced specific privacy risk model personal privacy ubiquitous computing described case studies privacy risk models designing ubiquitous computing applications 
combined interviews lo fi prototypes privacy risk model helped identify number privacy risks ubicomp applications development come solutions managing risks 
noted earlier just security threat model perfect just task analysis perfect privacy risk model perfect 
analysis predict potential personal information 
privacy risk model help designers consider specific community users potential risks benefits control feedback mechanisms means recourse recovery 
words helps design reasonable level privacy 
privacy difficult design issue deeply social legal technical market forces
