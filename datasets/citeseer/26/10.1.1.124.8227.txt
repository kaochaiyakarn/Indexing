netlogger toolkit distributed system performance tuning debugging dan gunter lbl gov brian gov berkeley national laboratory rod berkeley ca developers users high performance distributed systems observe performance problems unexpectedly low throughput high latency 
determining source performance problems requires detailed instrumentation components including applications operating systems hosts networks 
describe methodology enables real time diagnosis performance problem complex performance distributed systems 
methodology includes tools generating timestamped event logs provide detailed application system level monitoring tools visualizing log data real time state distributed system 
methodology called netlogger proven invaluable diagnosing problems networks systems code 
approach novel combines network host application level monitoring providing complete view entire system 
netlogger designed extremely lightweight includes mechanism reliably collecting monitoring events multiple distributed locations 
key words distributed systems performance analysis debugging 
performance characteristics distributed applications complex soft failures application produces correct results lower throughput higher latency expected 
bottlenecks occur component data path applications operating systems device drivers network adapters network components switches routers 
developed methodology known netlogger short networked application dan gunter brian tierney logger monitoring realistic operating conditions behavior elements application application communication path order determine exactly happening complex system 
distributed application components operating system components modified perform precision timestamping logging interesting events critical point distributed system 
events time correlated system behavior order characterize performance aspects system network detail actual operation 
netlogger demonstrated usefulness variety contexts frequently loosely coupled client server architectures 
began developing netlogger previous shown detailed application monitoring vital performance analysis application debugging 
gives brief summary main netlogger components provides case study

case studies note due space limitations figures illustrating case studies online www lbl examples radiance pic png globus logs gridftp select bug png second case study respectively 
case study netlogger instrument dimensional visualization engine called radiance read data disk rendered sent clients display 
lifelines graphs represent data flow generate image 
upper graph shows results netlogger tuning 
developer case assumed yo time greater image rendering time didn bother program multi threaded overlap processing yo 
seeing results developer program multi threaded 
new code produced results lower graph double performance 
second case study high performance ftp called instrumented 
enhancements gridftp extends ftp protocol transfer single file parallel tcp streams 
wan environments cause dramatic linear speedup 
bottom groups lifelines show headers packets arriving sockets parallel ftp client 
data steadily arriving sockets clearly client servicing sockets equally 
analysis showed months old bug way unix select call 
despite bug multi stream version ftp client dan gunter brian tierney faster single stream version noticed problem 
type subtle bug netlogger tracking 
case studies demonstrate netlogger ability analyze single application 
cases easy spot problems 
netlogger real power demonstrated analyzing distributed application time correlating monitoring application host network 

order achieve high performance widely distributed applications great deal analysis tuning needed
