document retrieval imposes conflicting normalizing accurate demands 
history information retrieval tests indexing languages shown indexing documents individual terms corresponding words word stems produces results produced indexing controlled vocabularies

terms characterizing stored texts may assigned manually trained personnel alternatively automatic indexing methods may handle term assignment automatically 
alternative retrieval models vector model vector space model documents identified sets attributes terms 
assuming terms equally important system uses term weighting 
vector processing model offers simple parallel queries documents 
extensions vector boolean models proposed notably including generalized vector space model orthogonal vector space 
common retrieval model extended boolean system term weights assigned query document terms strictness indicators 
extended system covers vector processing boolean fuzzy set retrieval common framework produces vast improved retrieval performance simple boolean operations 
probabilistic model probabilistic retrieval model differs previous discussed represents attempt set retrieval problem firm foundation 
classical probabilistic models needed term probability estimated accumulating number user queries containing term determining proportion times document relevant respective queries 
alternatively fixed query considered attempt determine probability arbitrary document containing query term judged relevant 
probabilistic retrieval approach large number different phenomena terms documents part probabilistic estimation process including term occurence information term relationships derived dictionaries prior knowledge occurence distributions terms
