major challenge semantic web xml stands integrating diverse ontologies created independent entities 
xml promise allowing seamless integration web services customized structured tags 
promise part point web sufficient agreement sets xml tags order information different parties build databases recipes organizes recipes country origin flavor databases understand insofar may exchange recipes 
xml allows format data structured way fails provide way different structure conventions interoperate 
attempts solve satisfactory 
usually solutions involve mapping separate schemas sort global schema creating global standardization problem requires significant coordinated effort solve 
approach create meta language daml allows automatic translation certain similar types ontologies requires great deal effort part schema designers advance brittle face changing ontologies 
ngd may create democratic natural ontology application unsupervised way 
furthermore want finer control ontological organization human expert may define custom ontology ngd may provide normal global automatic frame ontology may understood additional costly human effort 
example ngd may recipe example automatically understand difference chinese mediterranean recipe automatically translate conflicting ontologies
