daml ability describing semantics web services stark contrast emerging xml standards related web services 
standards soap wsdl designed provide descriptions message transport mechanisms describing interface service 
soap wsdl help automatic location web services basis capabilities 
emerging xml standard uddi provides registry businesses web services 
uddi describes businesses physical attributes name address services provide business services associate set attributes called tmodels 
tmodels associated description standards wsdl taxonomies naics 
uddi represent service capabilities help search services basis provide 
limitation shared xml standards described lack explicit semantics identical xml descriptions may mean different things depending uses 
proves major limitation capability matching fact crucial aspect capability matching done semantic level 
case requester know services provided time contact providers directly need search furthermore advertisers requesters different perspectives different knowledge service 
major problem capability matching unrealistic expect advertisements requests equivalent exists service fulfills exactly needs request 
example service may advertise financial news provider requester may need service report stock quotes 
task matching engine knowledge world semantic understanding advertisement request recognize degree mismatch retrieve advertisements closely match request 
task importing semantic web uddi requester select provider better suits needs deal mismatches request services available 
daml supports need semantic representation services tight connection daml oil 
daml oil supports subsumption reasoning taxonomies concepts 
furthermore daml oil allows definition relations concepts instance possible express statements part generally relation exists limitations daml oil lack definition formed formulae associated theorem prover

daml profiles objective service profiles describe functionality services selected provide functionalities 
service profiles describe public face service words service decides provide community 
service may functionalities advertised 
example book selling service may provide different functionalities allows services browse site find books interest allows buy books 
book seller choice advertising just book buying service browsing functionality buying functionality 
case service public provide browsing services implicitly allowing services browse registry buying book 
contrast advertising book selling functionality browsing service discourages browsing requesters intend buy 
decision functionalities advertise determines service requester intends browse buy select service advertises buying browsing capabilities advertises buying 
technical standpoint service profiles consist types information description provider service daml calls actor service specification functionalities provided service expressed terms transformation produced service host functional attributes provide additional information requirements service constraints :10.1.1.21.522
example news service reports information current news topic described follows actor describes runs service address contact information functionality massimo paolucci fig 

upper ontology service profiles described transformation takes input news topic output news relevant topic functional attributes represent response delay service cost 
service profile describes request service expectations requester 
instance requester may look news service reports stock quotes delay respect market 
role registries match request profiles advertised services identify services provide best match 
shows upper ontology service profiles 
logically divided parts bottom consists definition actor represent example type information specified provider service 
middle part describes functional attributes range quality rating rating assigned service geographic radius specifies geographic constraints service 
geographic importing semantic web uddi constraints prevent requesters geographic scope service providers 
constraint example prevents request chinese food issued pittsburgh served restaurant shanghai 
top part represents functional description service 
describes capabilities service terms inputs outputs preconditions effects

example input book buying service title author desired book 
output confirmation order received successfully processed 
preconditions represent conditions world true successful execution service 
book buying example precondition valid credit card 
execution service may result actions world conditions described effects agent
