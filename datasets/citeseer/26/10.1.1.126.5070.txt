important requirement time synchronization service robust node link failures 
implementation time synchronization traditional spanning tree algorithm synchronizing clocks 
algorithm distinguished node periodically sends time values spanning tree structure 
algorithm providing accuracy suffers drawback depending relatively static structure time dissemination performs poorly presence unreliable nodes links network partitions 
reason designed truly distributed time synchronization service robust commonly occurring faults sensor networks 
algorithm basic idea time synchronization algorithm locally synchronizing fastest clock 
scheme node maintains local clock changed estimate network time stored offset respect local clock 
node broadcasts network time value periodically receives time values neighbors 
node receives time value greater adjusts local time value ignores value received 
entire network synchronizes maximum clock value network 
scheme guarantees timestamp values node monotonically increasing 
time synchronization algorithm purely distributed local depend fixed structure disseminating time values 
consequently single node link fails nodes receive time values rest neighbors

consequently size queue maintained node bounded making efficient memory utilization 
possible implicit scheme despite having correctly received message child parent forwarded message due messages queue 
order avoid unnecessary retransmissions case successful reception uses optimization node cumulatively acknowledges messages queue outgoing message 
bounded size node queue ensures messages queue acknowledged outgoing message
