new system performs speech recognition foreign language non english news broadcasts segments stories indexes foreign data english news data english language sources 
new directions video information extraction summarization carnegie mellon university components multilingual informedia components multilingual informedia system hauptmann differ significantly original informedia system 
speech recognizer recognizes foreign language specifically 
component described 

phrase translation module transforms english queries allowing search equivalent words joint corpus english news broadcasts 

english topic labels foreign language news stories allow user identify relevant story target language hauptmann 
informedia translation facility current version translation facility attempts translate large chunks phrases finds text 
multilingual informedia system allows query posed english query translated target corpus language retrieval 
system takes advantage multi word phrase entries machine readable dictionary brown 
parses source language text phrases simple recursive algorithm 
scans dictionary translation entire text phrase fails searches phrasal translations substrings word smaller word smaller 
phrasal translation obtained set thereof multiple alternative translations kept part output string process recursively invoked pieces text preceding substring just translated 
recursion continues set chunks individual words produced covering text string translations chunks may may individual words 
concatenated results output string 
general text translation facility language pair long bilingual machine readable dictionary available format program understands 
example machine translation system carbonell developed carnegie mellon university put high quality story translation english 
machine translation word error rate speech recognition generated transcripts naturally spoken language produces results significantly degraded fully accurate written text 
foreign language topic detection initial experiments news clear returning foreign language result user sufficient 
users unable tell particular news clip relevant query returned due poor query translation inadequate information retrieval techniques 
allow user judgment returned stories attempted label news story english language topic 
topic identification done query translation facility translate story english words 
translation topic query 
separately indexed english language news stories manually assigned topics assigned 
smart information retrieval system translated topic query retrieve relevant labeled english stories 
topics labeled stories retrieved weighted relevance topic query weights topic summed 
favored topics threshold provide topic label news story 
topic label allows user identify general topic area incomprehensible foreign language text determine relevant topic area 
new directions video information extraction summarization carnegie mellon university informedia experience demand informedia experience demand project eod wactlar develops tools techniques systems allowing people capture record activities unobtrusively share collaborative settings spanning time space 
users may range rescue workers carrying personalized information systems operational situations remote crisis managers coordinating roles 
personal eod units record audio video global positioning system gps spatial information sensory data annotated human participants 
eod environment synthesizes data eod units collective experience global perspective ongoing archived personal experiences 
distributed collaborators brought time space share meaning perspectives 
constituent eod unit captures manages information unique point view 
information transferred central site integration multiple points view provides greater detail decisionmaking event reporting 
longer term goal dependent advances communication technology portable eod unit data collector data access device interoperating eod units allowing audio video search retrieval 
built prototype eod system builds core informedia technologies addressing continuously captured unstructured unedited video location data added information dimension 
tailoring speech recognition mobile active talkers hope improve quality resulting text transcript index material multimedia experience database 
exploring enhancements existing speech recognition algorithms filter background noise typical audio collected outdoor environments 
optimizing language models information retrieval accuracy transcript word error rate witbrock hope improve utility speech recognition output indexing experience database

underlying information extraction metadata creation ability extract names organizations people locations dates times named entities essential correlating occurrences important facts events metadata video library central production information 
techniques extract named entities output speech recognition systems ocr applied video stream integrating modalities achieve better results 
current approaches significant shortcomings 
methods rule maybury mani require significant amounts manually labeled training data achieve reasonable level performance bbn 
methods may identify name location small part information extracted know particular person politician location vacation resort 
geographical georeferences associated video segment represented single value set distinct values range values corresponding locations video situated locations referred video 
user able specify named location location coordinates order query browse events location distance location

distance location may expressed region refer synonymously hierarchically political geographically defined boundaries determine region 
named locations regions distances resolved common notation metric latitude longitude integration robust geographical information systems gis 
data time invariant place country names change coordinates 
data allows accurate display retrieval historical data 
prepositional near north need lexically analyzed done pictorial captions srihari 
challenges include varying granularity relative versus absolute new directions video information extraction summarization carnegie mellon university position information synchronization location information video stream likelihood inaccurate identification named locations
