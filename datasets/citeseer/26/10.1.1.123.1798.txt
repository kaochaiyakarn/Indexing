presents new unknown key share attacks sts mac version sts key agreement protocol uses mac algorithm provide key confirmation 
various methods considered preventing attacks 
key establishment process entities establish shared secret key 
key may subsequently achieve cryptographic goal confidentiality data integrity 
ideally established key precisely attributes key established face face example shared specified entities distributed uniformly random key space unauthorized computationally bounded entity learn key 
key establishment protocols come various flavors 
key transport protocols key created entity securely transmitted second entity key agreement protocols parties contribute information derive shared secret key 
symmetric protocols entities priori possess common secret information asymmetric protocols entities share public information authenticated 
concerned party key agreement protocols asymmetric setting 
unfortunately requirement key agreement protocols properties face face key establishment vague help protocol designers focus designing protocols meet explicit requirements 
implicit key authentication key confirmation explicit requirements considered essential 
honest entities legitimate entities execute steps protocol correctly 
informally speaking key agreement protocol said provide implicit key authentication assured entity aside specifically identified second entity possibly learn value particular secret key

key agreement protocol provides implicit key authentication participating entities called authenticated key agreement ak protocol 
informally speaking key agreement protocol said provide explicit key confirmation assured second entity computed agreed key 
protocol provides implicit key confirmation assured compute agreed key 
explicit key confirmation appears provide stronger assurances implicit key confirmation particular implies appears practical purposes assurances fact
