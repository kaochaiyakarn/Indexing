searching primary methods searching photographs shoebox 
uses conventional fulltext indexing roll photograph titles text annotations automatic speech recognition transcripts audio annotations 
second method uses region image retrieval provide searching visual similarity 
text speech indexing digital cameras provide audio recording facilities project quality sufficient adequate speech recognition performance 
addition notably poor audio quality built microphones problem noted users tendency speak informal conversational manner little attempt facilitate automatic transcription 
long noted speech recognition community major source recognition errors 
audio annotations provided close talking headset microphone 
initially entropic transcriber speech recognition engine 
relatively sophisticated speech recognition package capable stateof art performance dictated broadcast conversational speech engine report retrieval results 
constructed trigram language model vocabulary words british national corpus spoken written british english appropriate acoustic models british english 
vocabulary rate test set little lower expected unpredictable personal nature photo collection 
considered unnecessary complement word transcriptions open vocabulary recognition techniques phone lattices 
benefits approach probably outweighed speed scalability issues 
data relatively cleanly dictated quality microphone thought dictation package worth considering 
subsequently version software compatible microsoft speech api developed 
comes complete free microsoft speech recognition engine english dictated speech 
sufficiently long speaker enrollment procedure proved perform adequately needs 
loss degree accuracy provides lighter portable version application 
software allows users correct transcriptions simply add textual annotations feature 
transcripts stemmed porter stemmer indexed conventional inverted file index position information allow phrase searching 
user enters text query results side panel 
user types query stopwords entered highlighted green words index marked red 

image indexing annotation provides obvious benefit searching collection photographs require degree user effort 
speech input tried keep effort minimum 
alternative provide visual searching image content analysis 
topic generated great deal research interest years difficulty general task meant solution achieved limited domains 
image searching number problems properties suitable image comparison 
distance measures correspond human perception 
perform comparisons quickly 
formulate queries 
literature global local image properties investigated 
global image properties derived image local properties derived regions image 
local global properties extracted typically include colour texture spatial location shape properties ways characterise properties 
properties included easier differentiate images regions described resulting feature vectors increase dimensionality making efficient indexing difficult 
ways compare feature vectors 
choice distance function reflect human perception similar vectors correspond perceptually similar images image regions 
shown non metric distance functions yield better results metric distances euclidean distance 
nonmetric distances precludes multidimensional indexing structures tree 
high speed retrieval somewhat difficult achieve 
query formulation tricky problem 
user provide starting image request system finds similar pictures 
local image properties user may able select regions starting image 
systems expect user draw picture looking 
image collection simple optimistic expect user manage input 
shown region indexing perform better global colour histograms 
region segmentation approximation identifying objects image 
considered similar segmentation schemes consider regions obtained simply dividing image grid computing image properties regions 
hope discover computational expense sophisticated segmentation scheme justified improved retrieval effectiveness 
shoebox limited computationally fast methods 
experimented number segmentation schemes ranging extremely simple elaborate methods 
grid segmentation scheme simply divides image regions grid 
voronoi segmentation colour segmentation image thumbnail 
voronoi grid segmentation output voronoi segmenter segmented grid 
compared indexing schemes extracted feature vectors 
uses tree euclidean distance measure 
second uses method akin conventional text indexing feature space quantised coarsely corresponding values words inverted index 
suffer problems due quantisation tree tree retrieval fast conventional text retrieval 
addition familiar find similar query paradigm allow users select regions image target search 
outline regions generated segmentation algorithm placed image regions selected isolate just object photograph 
enables directed queries image searches global image properties 
system highlight regions resulting images match query regions giving user insight images retrieved 

evaluation evaluated image searching methods context personal photograph collection 
image retrieval methods rely low level features aim find visually similar images believe image searching useful user retrieve semantically similar images measure success failure 
image retrieval results considered light stringent relevance criteria 
test collection starting point evaluation shoebox obtain collection annotated photographs 
personal collection photographs taken scanned aps film

photographer annotated images resulting spoken annotations 
shoebox software enables annotations single photographs groups photographs allows multiple annotations image 
typical annotation entire film roll example photographs taken holiday france individual annotations describe picture 
worth mentioning annotator fluent non native english speaker 
speaking style largely planned speech spontaneous remarks 
factors combine vocabulary oov rate explain relatively high word error rate 
oov words proper nouns include names family members non british place names 
probably sorts words feature heavily queries 
addition automatic speech recognition annotations transcribed manually 
text speech retrieval retrieval task locate photographs searching associated transcribed annotations 
retrieval experiments reported collection requests generated users photographer

results table show retrieval performance various methods 
photograph retrieval image content disappointing

indexing method segmentation average precision full text date tree tree voronoi grid grid voronoi grid voronoi grid voronoi random table average retrieval precision image queries 
firstly grid segmenter voronoi segmentation tries isolate perceptual image regions 
coarsely grid feature vector models occurrence adjacent perceptual image regions boundaries 
secondly voronoi segmented image represents region single feature vector 
contrast grid segmenter models parameters proportional area region 
partial matches part large region match image 
combined segmentation scheme voronoi grid intended address second issue retaining isolation perceptual regions 
results show little improvement retrieval performance grid segmentation voronoi grid scheme despite increase number feature vectors 
certainly improvement justify extra computational cost 
may argue doing voronoi segmentation simple image features 
voronoi segmented image try extract shape properties impossible uniformly rectangular regions produced grid segmentation scheme 
shape useful property retrieval dealing complex images photographs shape varies dimensional orientation 
shape properties corrupted regions perceived human merged neighbours segmentation single region segmented region 
important feature elected spatial position image regions 
position pros cons 
absolute position useful sky usually top picture simple translation object image render 
relative position appears useful constituent regions person appear retrieved images mirroring image cause considered dissimilar 
reasons included spatial position feature vectors

general trends true partial image queries image ones 
voronoi grid simple grid segmentations perform equally better voronoi segmentation scheme 
striking better results achieved selecting image selecting searcher considered relevant parts image 
easy explain 
know simply selecting images taken time query image performs image content methods 
photos usually taken thing place 
just object photograph change likewise background setting remains 
means image query data match partial image query 
possible imagine situations appears case personal photograph collection presume true collections 
contrasts sharply stock photo collections usually illustrate image retrieval photo collection contain images polar bears different settings 
partial image searching shown perform better image searching situation 
management personal photograph collections retrieval date annotations performed visual retrieval 
conclude visual retrieval tools may especially valuable 

currently conducting user trials shoebox
