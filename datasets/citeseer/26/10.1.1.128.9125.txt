public key trace revoke scheme combines functionality broadcast encryption withthe capability traitor tracing 
specifically trusted center publishes single public key distributes individual secret keys users system anybody encrypt message specified subset revoked users decrypt resulting ciphertext small group users combine secret keys produce pirate decoder center trace traitors access decoder 
construct chosen ciphertext cca secure trace revoke scheme ddh assumption 
scheme adaptively secure scheme allowing adversary corrupt players point execution prior works achieves weak form non adaptive security chosen plaintext attacks :10.1.1.29.2021
independent interest slightly simpler construction shows natural separation classical notion cca security proposed relaxed notion security 
broadcast encryption scheme allows sender securely distribute data dynamically changing set users insecure channel 
possible selectively exclude revoke certain subset users receiving data 
particular user receive individualized decoder decrypts ciphertexts intended user 
broadcast encryption numerous applications including pay tv systems distribution copyrighted material streaming audio video 
formal study broadcast encryption initiated fiat naor showed scheme message overhead roughly log log maximum number excluded users called revocation threshold andn total number users 
subsequent works include :10.1.1.117.2711

fact schemes essentially identical refer emphasize public key nature scheme 
despite providing simple elegant scheme noticeable shortcomings 
informal notion security little sense revocation setting 
show security revocation show claims scheme semantically secure users revoked set priori fixed users compute secret key user 
clearly properties imply security notion really care informally states adversary controls set revoked users scheme remains semantically secure 
scheme shown satisfy set chosen adversary non adaptively fact chosen adversary learns public key 
weak non adaptive security clearly insufficient realistic usages public key revocation scheme 
importantly extended scheme secure users corrupted stops moment just single user corrupted user immediately revoked rest protocol 
weak scheme remain cca secure users revoked
