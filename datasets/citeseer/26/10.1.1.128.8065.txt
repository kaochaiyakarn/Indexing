lexical chaining text summarisation basic chaining algorithm follows steps 
select set candidate words generally nouns 
search list chains word satisfies relatedness criteria chain word word added chain new chain created 
relatedness criteria relationships outlined st onge 
st onge wordnet knowledge source lexical chaining 
devised different relationships candidate words extra strong strong 
extra strong relations lexical repetitions word strong relations synonyms near synonyms 
strong relations indicate shared hypernym hyponym meronym holonym word parent node child node wordnet topology 
medium strength relations follow sets rules laid st onge 
rules govern shape paths allowable wordnet structure 
st onge algorithm uses greedy disambiguation procedure word sense determined senses words occur text 
contrast non greedy approach waits words document processed calculates appropriate senses words 
general lexical chain summarizers follow approach firstly generating lexical chains strongest chains weight extract key sentences text 
barzilay elhadad form chains non greedy disambiguation procedure 
score chains calculate product chain characteristics length chain total number words chain plus repetitions homogeneity chain equal minus number distinct words divided length chain 
chain scores exceed average chain score plus twice standard deviation considered strong chains 
barzilay select sentence contains representative word strong chain representative word frequency greater equal average frequency words chain 
researchers approach building extractive summaries lexical chains exception brunn calculate chain scores pair wise sum chain word relationship strengths chain 
sentences ranked number strong chain words contain 
system chaining algorithm uses greedy lexical chaining approach 
step chain formation process assign parts ofspeech incoming document 
algorithm identifies noun proper nouns compound noun phrases searching patterns tags corresponding types phrases presidential jj campaign nn nn president nn bush np nn noun tag np proper noun tag

previous chaining approaches algorithm produces disjoint sets chains noun chains proper noun chains 
finding relationships proper nouns essential element modelling topical content news story 
unfortunately wordnet coverage proper nouns limited figures marco john glenn algorithm uses fuzzy string matching function find repetition relationships proper nouns phrases george bush president bush 
barzilay approach algorithm calculates chain scores number repetitions type wordnet relations chain members 
specifically shown equation chain score sum score assigned word pair chain 
word pair score calculated sum frequencies words multiplied relationship score chain score chain rel
