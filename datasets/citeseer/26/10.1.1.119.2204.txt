starting point notion agent entity appears subject beliefs desires 
philosopher dennett coined term intentional system denote systems 
agents intentional systems explaining human activity useful statements took umbrella believed going rain 
michael worked hard wanted possess phd 
statements folk psychology human behaviour predicted explained attribution attitudes believing wanting examples hoping 
folk psychology established people reading statements say meaning entirely clear give second glance 
attitudes employed folk psychological descriptions called intentional notions 
philosopher daniel dennett coined term intentional system describe entities behaviour predicted method attributing belief desires rational dennett 
dennett identifies different grades intentional system order intentional system beliefs desires beliefs desires beliefs desires 
second order intentional system sophisticated beliefs desires doubt intentional states beliefs desires intentional states 
dennett carry hierarchy intentionality far required 
obvious question legitimate useful attribute beliefs desires artificial agents 
isn just 
mccarthy argued occasions intentional stance appropriate ascribe beliefs free intentions consciousness abilities wants ma chine legitimate ascription expresses information machine expresses person 
useful ascription helps understand structure machine past behaviour repair improve 
logically required humans ex pressing reasonably briefly known state machine particular situation may require mental qualities qualities isomorphic 
theories belief knowledge wanting constructed machines simpler setting humans applied humans 
ascription mental qualities straightforward machines known structure computer operating systems useful applied entities structure incompletely known 
mccarthy quoted shoham objects described intentional stance 
turns 
doctoral thesis showed simple automata objects consistently ascribed intentional descriptions similar rosenschein kaelbling albeit different motivation arrived similar rosenschein kaelbling 
example consider light switch perfectly coherent treat light switch cooperative agent capability transmitting current invariably transmits current believes want transmitted switch simply way communicating desires 
shoham adults find description absurd 

answer intentional stance description perfectly consistent observed behaviour light switch internally consistent buy essentially understand mechanism sufficiently simpler mechanistic description behaviour 
shoham put crudely know system need rely intentional explanations behaviour 
complex systems complete accurate picture system architecture working available mechanistic design stance explanation behaviour may practicable 
consider computer 
complete technical description computer available hardly practicable appeal description explaining menu appears click mouse icon 
situations may appropriate adopt intentional stance description description consistent simpler alternatives 
intentional notions abstraction tools provide convenient familiar way describing explaining predicting behaviour complex systems 
intentional system necessary condition agenthood sufficient condition 
master thesis literature cognitive science component disciplines attempt find unifying concept underlies notion agenthood 
forced agent capacity beliefs desires thing admits unified account cognitive science 
agent system conveniently described intentional stance simplest consistent description requires intentional stance
