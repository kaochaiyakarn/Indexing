hypothesized characteristics relationship change necessarily positive direction 
assumed adult child awareness parent activities increase simply providing information 
hoped feelings emotional connectedness parties increase technological bridge 
acknowledged connectedness potentially decrease part older adult feels isolated adult child shifts burden maintaining emotional connection heavily dfp bridge

privacy traditional security final set questions revolve cost benefits tradeoffs especially older adults assessing dfp system sufficient value warrant adoption

generally speaking research older adults concerned maintaining careful balance privacy autonomy 
important aging necessitates compromise 
giving privacy order maintain autonomy valid choice question privacy order maintain autonomy limit type sensor technology provides correct balance

crux question posed adult children concerned elderly parent today normal day intuition tells certain days week regular pattern 
people tend pick certain days carry particular tasks laundry yard 
add routines pattern activity imposed outside obligations pace weekly events schedule trash collection life assumes semi regular pace changes slowly global rhythms seasons 
retired helen schedule patterns driven preferred routines outside commitments 
volunteer goes church yard 
regular pattern activity provides opportunity characterize certain days week characterization provide baseline adult child better determine chosen day typical 
simplest ways characterize day ignore sensors fired accumulate number sensor firings particular time period 
doing calculation current day displaying background previous similar days week provides simple means comparison 
took approach field trial appears reasonably characterize certain days making distinct days 
best example look strong pattern see 
see single day monday april shown green background previous shown gray 
see day green displayed background previous consecutive days include previous thursday friday saturday sunday 
pattern green bars clearly match previous consecutive better match previous consecutive days seen 
going back data opportunity exhaustively examine similarities common days versus consecutive days thursday friday saturday sunday 
diary entries help determine days truly unusual comparison typical days 
trends appears second common concern held adult children aging parents knowing subtle declines capabilities behavior 
examples include sleeping sleeping eating general reductions activity abilities climbing stairs data available dfp sensors includes potential modeling physical space sensors part kitchen data unlabeled training data certain routines look data 
challenge determine types routines gleaned data identify gradual changes routines 
know progressive declines helen abilities field trial know behavior shifted gradually changes seasons 
hope data available research groups general test data set evaluating pattern detection algorithms 
chi papers assistive applications april portland oregon usa sensing multiple people potential data multiple people home 
scenario potential double sensor firings house undermine inferences data 
plan explore feasibility identifying discontinuous sensor firings indication multiple people different rooms 
detect firings step backwards forwards data determine additional person entered left house 
field studies considerable amount effort needed conduct study seemingly simple especially time 
coordination extended family homes challenging 
fortunate helen motivated participate initial motivation came 
installing network sensors home routine 
pragmatics negotiating third party payment broadband connections proved tiresome predicted 
experience packaged easily deployable version dfp wireless motion sensors 
system includes software entering home floor plan configuring calibrating sensors establishing connection portrait display home 
part involves research groups deploy technology related research trials 
combining medical activity monitoring effort combining activity monitoring wearable medical monitoring older adults severe medical concerns 
working xxx investigate combination wearable blood pressure glucose level monitors activity monitoring older adults type diabetes 
different visualizations needed clinical physician reviewing data periodically older adult monitoring data traditional dfp interface augmented medical data family members 
interested types data aid families noticing deviations behavior aid clinicians understanding larger context surrounding medical data 
activity monitoring proactive interaction approached research group interested dfp technology proactive interface older adults depression 
addition providing awareness information concerned family members system detect extended periods low activity attempt encourage healthy behavior
