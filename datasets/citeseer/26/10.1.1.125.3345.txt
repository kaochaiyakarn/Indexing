internal evidence provided sequence words constitute entity 
contrast external evidence criteria obtained context entities appear 
time ner introduced mainly approaches adopted deal task 
referred knowledge uses explicit resources rules gazetteers commonly hand crafted 
follows rafael mu oz university san vicente spain rafael ua es learning paradigm usually uses resource tagged corpus train supervised learning algorithm 
knowledge approach kind gazetteers distinguished 
hand trigger gazetteers contain key words indicate possible presence entity type 
words usually common nouns

initially specially muc conferences ner systems developed belong knowledge approach 
approach proved able obtain high scores 
fact highest score obtained knowledgebased system muc reached mikheev 
approach important problem gazetteers rules difficult tedious develop maintain 
system open domain linguistic experts needed build rules takes time tune resources order obtain satisfactory results 
lately research falls learning paradigm 
regarding creation maintenance gazetteers problems identified mainly creation maintenance effort overlaps gazetteers problem identified assumes gazetteers manually created maintained 
case 
gazetteers automatically created maintained extracting necessary information available linguistic resources think promising line research 
research works carried direction 
example ner system uses trigger gazetteers automatically extracted wordnet magnini wordnet predicates 
advantage case resource multilingual porting language straightforward magnini 
deals automatically building location gazetteers internet texts applying text mining procedures 
uses linguistic patterns language dependent 
author claims approach may successfully create gazetteers ner 
agree magnini order automatically create maintain trigger gazetteers hierarchy common nouns approach 
want focus automatically creation maintenance entity gazetteers 
reason class common nouns ones triggers stable class proper names ones entity gazetteers 
maintenance important new entities taken account appear 
example refer presidents trigger word president uncommon trigger refer changes time 
hand entities presidents change new presidents appear current presidents disappear 
aim find method allow automatically create maintain entity gazetteers extracting necessary information linguistic resources 
important restriction want method independent language possible 
rest structured follows 
section discuss proposal 
section presents results obtained comments 
section outline 
approach section approach automatically build maintain dictionaries proper nouns 
nutshell analyse entries encyclopedia aid noun hierarchy 
motivation proper nouns form entities obtained entries encyclopedia features definitions encyclopedia help classify correct entity category 
encyclopedia wikipedia english version wikipedia wikipedia multi lingual web encyclopedia updated continuously collaborative way 
reasons chosen encyclopedia big source information

noun hierarchy noun hierarchy wordnet miller 
widely resource nlp tasks 
initially monolingual resource english language project called eurowordnet vossen provided wordnet hierarchies www wikipedia org en wikipedia org wiki main page set languages european union 
eurowordnet defines language independent index called inter lingual index ili allows establish relations words different languages 
ili facilitates development languages 
noun hierarchy consider nodes called synsets wordnet opinion represent accurately different kind entities working location organization person 
example consider synset corresponding entity class person 
information contained synset number person individual somebody mortal human soul human person entry wikipedia pos tagger carreras applied sentence definition 
example sentence entry portugal simple english wikipedia portugal portugal nn vbz dt country country nn dt south west south west nn europe europe np fp noun definition obtain synset wordnet contains sense follow branch synset arrive synset considered belonging entity class arrive root hierarchy 
arrive considered synset consider noun belonging entity class considered synset 
example may clarify explanation portugal location simple wikipedia org wiki portugal carried experiments account senses provided wordnet 
performance obtained substantially better processing time increases notably 
country location south west europe location said application pos tagger optional 
algorithm perform considerably faster pos data need process nouns 
pos tagger available language algorithm applied 
drawback perform slower needs process words 
experimentation conclude results significantly change 
apply weighting algorithm takes account amount nouns definition identified belonging different entity types considered decides entity type entry belongs 
algorithm constant kappa allows increase decrease distance required categories order assign entry class 
value kappa minimum difference number occurrences second frequent categories entry order assign entry category 
example value kappa lower algorithm say entry portugal belongs location entity type 
basic approach apply different heuristics think may improve results obtained effect analysed section results 
heuristic called instance tries determine entries wikipedia instances portugal word classes country 
done fact named entities consider instances 
interested word classes 
consider entry wikipedia instance associated entry wordnet instance 
procedure determine entry word net instance word class similar magnini 
second heuristic called wordnet 
simply determines entries wikipedia associated entry wordnet 
may information wordnet determine category 
experiments results tested approach applying entries simple english wikipedia randomly selected 
entries manually tagged expected entity category distribution entity classes seen table seen table amount entities categories person location balanced case type organization 
instances type 
understandable encyclopedia locations people defined usual case organizations 
said section considered heuristics explained carrying experiments 
applied instance heuristic 
second experiment considers heuristics explained section instance wordnet 
results heuristic experimentation proved increase recall precision entity category 
experiment considered values constant kappa algorithm 
values experimentation values provide highest recall highest precision respectively 
results experiment seen table results second experiment table 
seen tables best recall classes obtained experiment kappa table best precision obtained experiment kappa table 
results location person categories opinion purpose building maintaining quality gazetteers manual supervision 
results obtained organization class low 
mainly due fact high interaction category location combined practically absence traditional entities organization type companies 
interaction seen indepth results presentation follows 
order clarify results depth data tables 
tables error analysis showing false posi data available research www 
ua es index html resources tives false negatives true positives true negatives categories configuration provides highest recall experiment kappa provides highest precision experiment kappa 
tables see interactions classes occurrences tagged belonging class guessed belonging different class low 
case significant location organization 
table see entities tagged organization classified loc tagged organization guessed correct type 
entities tagged location classified organization 
due fact countries related entities european union considered organizations locations depending role text 
method automatically create maintain entity gazetteers resources encyclopedia noun hierarchy optionally pos tagger 
method proves helpful tasks facilitates creation maintenance kind resources 
opinion principal drawback system low precision configuration obtains acceptable value recall 
automatically created gazetteers need pass step manual supervision order quality 
positive side conclude method helpful takes time automatically create gazetteers method supervise create dictionaries scratch 
updating gazetteers straightforward just executing procedure new entries wikipedia entries exist time procedure performed time analysed set ones detected entities added corresponding gazetteers
