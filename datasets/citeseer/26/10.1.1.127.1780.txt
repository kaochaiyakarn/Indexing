approach entity broadcast information entities 
network require broadcast message machine representing sending entity machines representing entities 
situations subset game entities need receive messages 
information broadcast entities usually apply filter received messages supported afosr muri nsf ani process ones need receiving 
example message indicating tank moved gun turret need sent entities see tank game
