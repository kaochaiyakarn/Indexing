characteristics open learning environments characteristics open learning environments integrating heterogeneous resource providers distinguish open environments currently studied systems 
resource appear disappear ad hoc manner 
peers provide resources appear disappear randomly 
resources authored different people different goals background domain expertise 
providers resources maintain resource proprietary databases 
personalization techniques implemented purposes context 
user learner model usually reflects context techniques 
resources accessed consumed people differ wide range characteristics 
user learner features maintained integrated systems 
human resource management systems modules enterprise resource planning systems incorporate module related maintaining information employees 
module usually maintains information employee identification skills previous jobs previous training current role position transcripts 
task management systems project management systems sales force automation simply outlook calendar contain usually information tasks daily performed 
user modelling servers maintain characteristics likes dislikes interests bought products 
electronic course providers model learner performance 
basically refers learner attended courses ratings performance 
performance record refers formal certificates earned course providers results additional material course 
providers maintain user interests preferences goals 
obvious environments agreement common structures scope information user specific communities specific personalization techniques

semantic web technologies semantic web technologies resource description format rdf rdf schema rdfs provide interesting possibilities 
rdf models describe learning resources 
rdf bindings learning object metadata lom purposes 
rdf model learner description 
rdf schemas serve define vocabularies records rdf file 
restriction different schemas rdf file rdf model 
schema identification comes attributes schema backward dereferencing easily possible 
example rdf model learner attribute performance coding papi standard 
field papi standard prescribed papi schema 
instance record look follows rdf description rdf id record

edutella infrastructure allow connect peers provides metadata resources described rdf :10.1.1.11.5917
edutella provides powerful datalog query language rdf qel 
query formulated rdf format schemas 
furthermore edutella able process insert update requests 
example simple query datalog syntax learner model follows query student performance student performance value 
query student query tries find performance values student 
variable bound performance record identifiers variable performance values

mentioned personalization techniques depend information user 
question development personal profile open heterogeneous environment specific standard combine existing standards needs develop profile schema intermediate solution 
methodology employed answer questions employed scenario methodology analyzing requirements personal profiles 
methodology consists steps collecting scenarios analyzing scenarios creating exemplar conceptual views scenarios abstracting generalizing exemplar views creating classes user features analyzing available standards mapping classes class conceptual model categories supporting standards refining scenarios driven development user profile specific subset personalization techniques decided broader scope taken scenarios collected 
enabled analyze standards learner profiles different perspectives described scenarios 
personalization techniques suggested derived requirements scenarios 
scenarios analysis collected scenarios partners elena project consortium 
scenario driven approaches quite powerful techniques expressing high level requirements queries user formulate looking educational material information 
scenarios helped better shape diversity personalization techniques learner features needed techniques 
scenarios analyzed simple stories describe usually different aspects personalization different levels detail abstraction 
group scenarios oriented personalization previous experiences performance domain finishing certification program enhancing level knowledge learner domain 
second group scenarios activities user involved job sale assistant learn features new version product sell

group scenarios reflected interest learn domain related ambitions learn history country learner lives 
interesting scenarios explicitly considered distributed nature elena network availability reusable resources lecturer looking resource enhance course resources help additional resources newly created course
