tight coupling principle tight coupling interface components began emerge direct manipulation graphic user interfaces 
example user saves document save menu item grayed change 
tight coupling helps reveal software state constrains user making erroneous useless actions 
complex example tight coupling interrelationship text word processor position thumb scroll bar page number displayed window border 
moving thumb causes text scroll page number updated 
write logical proposition describing relationship display components 
statement indicating top document displayed thumb top scroll bar page indicator set 
program design ensure preservation display invariants 
word processors may fail preserve invariant sections document deleted document reformatted larger font 
compensate word processors may include command update thumb position moved 
errors violate principle tight coupling 
tight coupling applies components query facility 
designed facility users able see impact selection forming query 
example user specifies want films certain actors directors selectable 
prevent users specifying null sets films directed francis ford coppola 
aspect tight coupling linkage output support efficient screen space eliminating distinction commands queries input results tables output 
short output candidate input 
principle emerged hypertext notion embedded menus replaced earlier designs paragraph output followed menu select information 
logical highlighted words text simply allow users select words arrow keys mouse touchscreen 
outputs inputs principle reduced screen clutter eliminating redundancy focused users attention single location gathering information applying action get information 
principle applied chemical table elements element selected causing sliders set element values health statistic map state selected retrieve detailed data point light selected retrieve detailed information photo available
