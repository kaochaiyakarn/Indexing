knowledge attempt evaluate parsers genres grade levels implementation learning technology 
task syntactic parsing valuable natural language understanding applications anaphora resolution machine translation question answering 
syntactic parsing general definition may viewed discovering underlying syntactic structure sentence 
specificities include types elements relations retrieved parsing process way represented

presents evaluation parsers coh metrix project graesser institute intelligent systems university memphis 
coh metrix tool provides new methods automatically assessing text cohesion readability difficulty 
form cohesion measures syntactic information incarnation depend heavily hierarchical syntactic information 
developing measures 
current goal provide reliable parser output available able process larger texts real time 
usual trade accuracy speed taken account 
part evaluation adopt constituent approach evaluation output parses derived way data generate similar bracketed output 
major goal consistently evaluate freely available stateof art parsers standard data set genre data sets corpora typical learning technology environments 
report parsers competitiveness array dimensions including performance robustness tagging facility stability length input handle 
briefly address particular types relation measures planned coh metrix assumed typical learning technology applications 
coh metrix measures centrally rely parses include causal intentional cohesion main verb subject identified anaphora resolution syntactic re lations pronoun referent identified temporal cohesion main verb tense aspect identified measures require complex algorithms operating cleanest possible sentence parse faulty parse lead cascading error effect
