tools enable ease annotation 
annotation cumbersome time consuming consumers professionals alike 
second methods developed fast visual scanning images zoom pan operations 
tools may scale manage tens thousands images 
tools near practical meaningful organization photo collections 
low level features extracted semantic gap recognizing objects furthermore topics photographs wide 
news automatically collected metadata shown helpful organization photo collections 
demonstrate timestamp digital cameras embed photo effective construction browsers photo collections annotated manually 
time automatic organization technology advances feasible add location information digital photographs exact coordinates photo taken 
location stronger memory cues people recall past events location information extremely helpful organizing presenting personal photo collections 
implemented photo browser exploits geo referenced photographs 
uses time location information automatically group photos hierarchies location time events 
system proven effective users browsing personal collections

location location recorded photo refers location camera moment capture 
interesting location location subject photo assume approximately similar camera location 
location represented latitude longitude translated useful location representation 
map option shown browsing textual location hierarchy augment map location browsing replace map example screen real estate limited 
text location shelf geographical dataset enables querying latitude longitude pair get containing country province state county city park

implementation group photos geographic clusters expected sense user necessarily correspond administrative division provinces counties cities parks example user lives san francisco may clusters san francisco area yosemite area east coast details generate clusters assign meaningful geographic names geographical dataset appear 
time day knowledge time day photo shot searching image collection remembers certain photo taken late night 
cases users set camera clock usually operate camera time 
clock timestamp photos taken camera 
time setting sufficient sort pictures time associate pictures approximate month date taken 
pitfall appears user travels different time zone 
users bother re setting camera clock resulting timestamps inaccurately portray time picture taken 
example photo taken israel morning camera set pacific standard time appear taken night hour difference 
problem solved location information photo taken original time zone camera clock set 
information sufficient compute local time photo 
location aware cameras automatically detect local time cellular phones today 
compute local time geographical dataset containing world time zones 
dataset queried photo coordinates returning correct time zone photo 
step simply calculating offset original actual time zones applying photo time get local time 
light status people perception time derived clock time daylight status 
example people may recall certain picture taken dark outside sunset sunrise local time location photo find minutes away sunset sunrise picture taken 
way implement algorithm compute sunset sunrise time photo location time 
naval observatory web service service returns complete set daily sunset sunrise times year latitude longitude query 
give idea number necessary queries network requests required accurate integer lat long values personal collection photos spanning months countries results cached reused year latitude longitude value collection 
people expected remember exactly time sunset sunrise pictures taken group photos day night dawn 
current implementation grouping includes photos taken hour sunset night photos include photos taken hour sunset hour sunrise 
arbitrary grouping may somewhat limiting 
example northern locations longer sunsets 
considering ways overcome problem 
weather status temperature people filter photos weather information recall certain event occurred night event took place indoors event clear day addition people may remember outside temperature time picture taken freezing 
aa navy mil weather underground web service get weather information 
historic data queried zipcode date pair weather station date pair weather outside united states geographic datasets allow translate latitude longitude pair zip code weather station commonly available 
results query server cached photos taken day area reducing required number queries 
number required queries small comparison number photos 
photos example spanning months different zip codes queries web service required caching results 
weather data get day hourly approximately report weather conditions rainy clear temperature 
annotate photo weather conditions appear hours photo single photo associated rainy cloudy example temperature computed average temperatures measured hours photo time 
actual measured temperatures option perceived temperatures factoring 
events personal photo collections strong notion events 
people think photos terms events usually associate photo certain event wedding vacation birthday party event considered useful context 
computer systems today detect essence event birthday 
technology mature able automatically group photos taken event especially location data available show 
get essence event consider correlating events algorithms identify photographer calendar 
event public wedding baseball game music concert sharing data users may help automatically semi automatically assigning meaningful name event systems 
describe automatically detects events time location information photo 
events annotated place name location photos event time supply full automatically derived context san francisco th july

example look camera category 
camera remembered solid line perceived useful dotted line mentioned rarely textual descriptions dashed line 
shows outdoor indoor location identity number subjects photo clearly top choices usefulness searching remembering accordingly top categories mentioned descriptions 
day night status photo taken close 
noteworthy differences subjects evaluation cue importance searching vs remembering stored camera colors 
cues better remembered useful search mentioned times open photo descriptions 
simple explanation difference cues filter 
example photos taken camera remembered useful 
hand colors may perceived un useful search users imagine right user interface language 
conversely category participants study significantly rated higher useful search survey participants remembered 
category date 
discussed people remember dates exact time periods 
remember date useful easy find photo photos timestamped 

user study survey conducted suggest contextual cues useful browsing managing personal collections photos 
particular location cues prove important cues involving people images 
context involving location people rated high usefulness retrieval remembered 
addition categories listed independently participants describing photographs 
location time derived context weather local time daylight status season proved useful 
participants interacted categories comfortably user interface photo descriptions useful retrieval remembered 
particular local time daylight status stronger cues date time photo collections span years may important retrieval actual year photo taken 
outdoor indoor classification remembered useful people minds participants mentioned photo descriptions 
addition people remember photo colors clear useful 
possibly simple interface querying colors beneficial 
study serve guide hopefully effort automatically integrating contextual metadata photo browsers 
ranking memory recall values cues help decide research efforts profitably invested need move graph order photo collections increasingly accessible
