semantic similarity measure proposed alternative pattern matching comparison process 
describes proposal wordnet attempt introduce semantic knowledge information retrieval task 
initial information retrieval task focused research locating relating information large scale federated database systems application call rich system currently evaluated document retrieval application 
difficult see applicability aspects information retrieval filtering 
traditional information retrieval systems particularly susceptible problems posed richness natural language particular polysemous nature natural language words multitude ways concepts described 
widely information retrieval systems little clever pattern matching systems 
attempt place index query terms context simply viewed patterns matched 
bates points probability persons term describing thing 
attempting directly match user query terms data set terms give bad results 
brings need knowledge base distinguish different senses words relate concepts semantically similar 
similarity function derived give degrees relatedness index query terms opposed simple direct match 
remainder organised follows

system power line thesaurus line dictionary refer 
information wordnet organised logical groupings called synsets 
synset consists list synonymous word forms semantic pointers describe relationships current synset synsets 
word form single word words connected underscores referred collocations 
semantic pointers number different types including hyponym hypernym meronym holonym part part meronym holonym member member meronym holonym substance substance nouns wordnet knowledge base ignoring verbs adjectives adverbs 
initial knowledge base consisted number hierarchical concept graphs constructed wordnet data files 
root concepts chosen result set experiments determine root concepts group provide maximum coverage nouns wordnet whilst minimising degree overlap 
set hcg roots achieves follows entity psychological feature location shape abstraction state event act group possession phenomenon 
resulting ranged size unique concepts entity concepts shape 
organised manner wordnet data files accessible index files index concepts byte offsets hcg file 
shortcoming simple efficient organisation extending files impossible beck 
constructing kb manner advantages disadvantages 
significant advantage fact resulting serve comprehensive starting points obtaining contain relevant concepts information domain 
wordnet contain comparatively rich set semantic link types 
foremost disadvantages fact links resulting weighted 
section addresses problem fully 
concept graphs reported rada kim lee contain links whilst concepts ginsberg system related broader term narrower term links

tversky feature similarity model arguably powerful similarity model date 
applicability situation require richer knowledge base case 
wordnet derived knowledge base quite thorough coverage concepts number semantic relation types connecting concepts considerably required feature similarity model 
employ combination conceptual distance information approach estimating semantic similarity 
conceptual distance approach rada kim lee uses edge weights refer section discussion edges weighted adjacent nodes estimator semantic similarity 
information approach measure semantic similarity carried philip resnick 
resnick views noun synsets class words class words synset words directly indirectly subordinate synsets 
conceptual similarity considered terms class similarity 
similarity classes approximated information content class noun hierarchy subsumes classes 
information content class approximated estimating probability occurrence class large text corpus see appendix discussion class probabilities 
similarity classes expressed sim max log ci ci ci set classes dominating ci class probability class ci log ci information content class ci 
intended extend wordnet include relation types form attribute function connect wordnet adjective verb collections noun collection 
developments considerably enhance applicability feature similarity models 
implemented noun occurrences wall street journal special handling collocations methodology probably best illustrated example assume wish discover similarities classes car bicycle banana fork 
sim car bicycle see wordnet classes car bicycle subordinate synset info content vehicle instrumentality artifact object entity takes similarity measure maximum information content value set classes subsume synsets sim car bicycle 
notice expected classes grow frequent informative moves higher hierarchy 
car bicycle specific informative classes common conclude similar 
contrast examples yield sim car fork sim car banana instrumentality object artifact entity object entity cars forks considerably similar cars bicycles similar cars bananas 
explained forks cars objects people artifacts said terms similarity cars bananas things object 
informal experimentation conceptual distance measure general concerns regard sole measure estimator conceptual similarity 
due comparatively broad replicates examples version wordnet wordnet derived compared rada worked solely medical domain conceptual distance measures accurate expected 
situation improved large degree decided include non hierarchical link types distance calculation 
conceptual distance measure particularly susceptible vagaries builders wordnet 
particular organisation concepts wordnet puzzling 
irregular densities links concepts results unexpected conceptual distance measures 
typically result expected links concepts 
due general operation conceptual distance similarity estimator concepts middle high sections hcg geographically close deemed conceptually similar 
depth scaling factor link weighting mechanism effect cases general structure wordnet derived overcome link weighting causing serious side effects kb 
believe weaknesses conceptual distance estimator conceptual similarity addressed certain degree inclusion conceptual similarity measure 
expected combined conceptual similarity measure suffer severely absence expected links 
course question arises combine just measure answer fact resnik proposed measure weaknesses 
foremost fact technique ignores information wordnet may useful 
synonym relations relation types effectively adapted rada conceptual distance approach overlooked 
second weakness apparent method calculating information content classes 
polysemous words multi synsets exaggerated information content value 
takes instance word bank information content word include occurrences bank corpus regardless meaning 
gives part member substance links described non hierarchical links 
exaggerated information content value commercial bank river bank 
due fact information content values calculated synsets opposed individual words possible information content value exaggerated situations synsets number commonly occurring ambiguous words 
takes example synset yield fruit information content value synset calculated frequencies word fruit word yield 
fact information content class defined terms information contents subordinate classes super classes classes containing polysemous words similarly valued 
disregard ambiguous words particular problem fact classes wordnet refer particular senses 
final caveat apparent information theoretic approach semantic similarity fact different concepts similar concept 
effect clearly seen example motor vehicle car automobile 
ambulance convertible extract kb numbers brackets synsets information content values 
see information estimate similarity ambulance convertible car closer estimated similarity motor vehicle 
proposed research fully evaluate measures investigate possibility combining measures take advantage stronger aspects approach compensate individual weaknesses 
weighting hcg conceptual distance estimator semantic similarity requires edges concepts kb weighted 
concept graphs researchers rada kim lee created research large containing order tens thousands nodes 
reason usual process hand weighting link viable method automatically weighting link developed 
initial research area node metrics hierarchical hypertexts 
research subsequently considerably influenced sussna 
certain observations regard conceptual distance aid process automatically determining weight edges 
instance value weight link affected density hcg point depth hcg strength connotation parent child nodes 
regard width easily seen different parts hcg denser 
commonly held link dense part hierarchy represents smaller conceptual distance link dense region 
terms depth said distance shrinks descends hcg 
explain suppose sibling relations near top hierarchy deep detailed portion hcg 
example suppose node living thing high hierarchy children nodes plant animal 
siblings far apart conceptually compared siblings parent deep hcg 
illustrates point regarding local strength connotation 
life form animal person plant kb extract argued parent node life form strongly child nodes animal plant person nodes 
density hcg specific link type estimated counting number links type 
strength connotation link weighted estimated function information content value sibling parent node numbers nodes information content values 
result operations scaled dividing depth link hcg research described ongoing 
facilities exists constructing weighting number different strategies computing semantic similarity conceptual similarity measures process investigation currently underway improving scaling factor information content values hcg synsets 
inconsistencies left builders wordnet fact concepts thought level abstraction different levels root order hierarchy wordnet 
take example horse cow regarded level abstraction node horse levels root entity root concept cow levels deep 
large body information wordnet concept relative weightings link concept unfairly penalized 
performs word sense disambiguation text 
evaluation various configurations system currently underway 
application chosen evaluation document retrieval wall street journal text corpus trec harm queries evaluation procedures 
basically system natural language query expected rank top documents set wsj articles respect similarity query 
querying strategy compare query term index terms article aggregate comparisons give score relevance article query 
comparison mechanisms information conceptual distance semantic similarity estimators 
traditional pattern matching ir system tf idf term weightings baseline compare results 
unfortunate prerequisite application assumed existence sense disambiguator automatically tag words wsj articles appropriate kb meanings 
fine sense distinctions wordnet semantic tagger particularly perceptive accurate 
informal analysis semantic tagger shown promising results 
sample runs query matcher likewise promising 
includes complete analysis results large scale evaluation investigation appropriate method combining semantic similarity estimators rigorous evaluation semantic tagger development automatic hcg weighting strategy
