various reasons measures guarantee uniformly strong passwords practice researchers developers sought ways prevent dictionary attacks successfully executed 
online dictionary attacks may thwarted introducing small delay failed login attempt restricting number failed login attempts human loop verification methods see 
schemes encrypted key exchange eke strong password exponentiated key exchange help prevent line analysis captured network traffic
