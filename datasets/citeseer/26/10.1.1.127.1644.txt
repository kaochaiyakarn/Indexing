describes web syndrome align mediate mismatching third party web services closely related incompatible inputs outputs 
syndrome illustrated services grid bioinformatics analyses 
ontology driven treatment managing syndrome semiautomated service discovery invocation outlined 
treatment applicable domains 
vision semantic web services machine understandable descriptions data web services facilitate automated 
devil detail 
observe need align web services useful 
align mediate data syntactically semantically closely related directly compatible 
example services grid workflows perform bioinformatics analyses 
significant proportion web services workflows directly relevant biological purpose workflow required mediate outputs inputs consecutive services 
important part workflow bioinformatics data services autonomously created different groups world 
consequently universally accepted data model describing data inputs outputs services operate 
standards xml schema rarely describe primitive types xsd string 
limited mediating services operate complex structured types genbank records blast reports superficially services produce consume xsd string match compatible 
xsd string hides different complex data types degree matching falls categories 
exact match output input equivalent compatible 
close match kind shim required align services bridge gap 
match syntactic semantic services incompatible see www ncbi nlm nih gov html universal protein resource www org see www ncbi nlm nih gov education information html second scenario close matching common bioinformatics exemplifies web syndrome services nearly compatible 
example service producing record contains protein sequence blast service consuming protein sequences nearly compatible require 
accessor shim see table required access protein sequence record passed blast analysis 
open nature web autonomy data service providers syndrome cured foreseeable 
distinguishes related projects integrating biological data semantic web firstly aim accommodate autonomous web services open world 
secondly services may xml data pass strings encapsulating legacy proprietary file formats 
motivating examples taken real live scenarios complex data automation dangerous impossible 
characterise problem introduce potential role semantic description services aim plug gap left absence effective domain specific type systems aligning third party services 
problem symptomatic integrating implicitly typed bioinformatics data 
analogous physical world thin strips metal align pipes 
bioinformatics align data performing operations normally facilitated type system 
example shown table 
subclasses wsmo mediators probably 
important difference deployment invocation bioinformatics may difficult fully automate safe context dependent 
semantic translator example 
feel shim metaphor useful describing understanding software components currently required integrate understand bioinformatics data 
definition shim software transforms closely related data syntactically semantically order join outputs inputs components case web services 
hard precisely define think set symptoms integrating weakly implicitly typed semantically syntactically data 
characterising step working novel treatments web syndrome peculiar bioinformatics 
open world web majority services need kind shim order align user needs 
www wsmo org shim type input operation output description identifier dereference dereferenced re genbank id replaced pointer source genbank record syntax data represented translate data represented translates translator concrete repre alternate concrete tween representations sentation representation sequence data 
semantic dna sequence translate protein sequence translate dna translator protein mapper unique identifier map unique identifier maps ids 
embl genbank parser record parse syntax tree parse blast report 
iterator set iterate member set iterate members set sets diff set differences comparing blast reports notifies accessor record access subset record new sequences access subset table 
examples taken grid project 
partial classification inputs outputs task operation performed 
semantic approaches type systems capabilities type system alleviate problems currently address 
able coerce access infer reflect cast data easier bioinformatics data explicitly typed 
creating type system distributed dynamic complex domain bioinformatics non trivial task fraught technical social pitfalls 
registries web services succeeded allowed data providers register services quickly minimal typing 
expect bioinformatics data typed semantically syntactically order allow smoother mediation 
systems impose internal type system top third party services xml 
providing working solution feel approach scalable restricts number services available 
grid project adopted approach third party services native form 
grid project created ontology describe bioinformatics data services currently extending model specifically tackle syndrome describing shim services data process main bioinformatics services shim services mediate 
ontology describes existence data types detailed description structure map xml schemas exist 
describes services semantically know output record input protein sequence closely related mapped accessor shim see table access protein sequence contained record 
process currently requires human intervention help ontology sorts transformations supported user guided biologically sensible workflows 
intend ontology constructing workflows recognise service mismatches identify kind shim required 
information suitable shim automatically retrieved library 
goal shim management transparent user 
describing transformations perform user composing workflow abstracted away details mediating underlying services 
bioinformatics example web syndrome suggest problem development applications autonomous web services 
high probability third party services exactly match user needs closely related shim needed 
propose treat syndrome follows 
describe classify ontological model 
create library factory shim services 
model identify closely related mismatching services 
semi automate discovery invocation 
whichever semantic web architecture successful adoption bioinformatics community require mechanisms describing discovering composing shim services currently mediation possible
