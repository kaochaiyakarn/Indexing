sense division bank model 
availability researchers wsd currently relying sense distinctions provided established lexical resources machine readable dictionaries wordnet uses senses 
dominant model studies bank model attempts extend clear delineation bank money bank riverside sense distinctions 
clear convenient delineation means applicable words 
psychological validity notion senses simpson burgess jorgensen lexicographers aware lack agreement senses sense divisions see example robins stock 
problem sense division object discussion aristotle devoted section topics subject philosophers linguists continued discuss topic length quine lyons cruse lack resolution years striking 
granularity 
foremost problems wsd determine appropriate degree sense granularity 
authors slator wilks remarked sense divisions finds dictionaries fine purposes nlp 
overly fine sense distinctions create practical difficulties automated wsd introduce significant combinatorial effects example slator wilks note sentence phrase huge envelope air surface earth different potential combined sense assignments moderately sized ldoce require making sense choices extremely difficult expert lexicographers increase amount data required supervised methods unrealistic proportions 
addition sense distinctions dictionaries human readers capable making 
wellknown study kilgarriff shows impossible human readers assign words unique sense ldoce see discussion wilks forthcoming 
recognizing dolan proposes method dictionary senses combining create sense distinctions 
sense divisions thesauri roget difficult assign unknown words encountered text 
approach examines domain contextual evidence determine meaning similar employed ai disambiguation 
reviewers special issue remarked aristotle pc probably worked word sense disambiguation 
nancy ide jean ronis computational linguistics unique sense find appropriate options see example yarowsky :10.1.1.11.9982:10.1.1.11.9982
chen chang issue propose algorithm combines senses dictionary ldoce link categories thesaurus 
combining dictionary senses solve problem 
degree granularity required task dependent 
homograph distinction necessary tasks speech synthesis restoration accents text tasks machine translation require fine sense distinctions cases finer monolingual dictionaries provide see 
example english word river translated french river flows ocean rivi re 
strict correspondence task degree granularity required 
example noted earlier word mouse distinct senses animal device translates french cases 
hand information retrieval distinction senses mouse important difficult imagine reason distinguish river sense river sense rivi re

cases meaning best considered continuum shades meaning fall see cruse points senses combined split vary dramatically 
senses usages 
aristotelian idea words correspond specific objects concepts displaced th century ideas saussure 
antoine sense word defined average linguistic uses 
wittgenstein takes similar position asserting senses usages don look meaning 
similar views apparent theories meaning bloomfield harris meaning function distribution barwise perry situation semantics sense senses word seen abstraction role plays systematically discourse 
cobuild project sinclair adopts view meaning attempting anchor dictionary senses current usage creating sense divisions basis clusters citations corpus 
atkins kilgarriff forthcoming implicitly adopts view harris sense distinction reflected distinct context 
similar view underlies class methods cited section brown pereira tishby pereira :10.1.1.13.9919
issue sch tze continues vein proposes technique avoids problem sense distinction altogether creates sense clusters corpus rely pre established sense list 
enumeration generation

test words differ study study including words assignment clearly distinguishable senses varies considerably exhibit different degrees ambiguity bank vs line words different parts speech words tend appear frequently metaphoric metonymic usages bank vs head 
seriously criteria evaluating correctness sense assignment vary
