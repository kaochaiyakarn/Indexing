challenge scarcity training data major challenge query concept learning task faces scarcity training data 
users generally impatient label large number training instances concept learning task 
typical learning task infer target concept fewer training instances number low space level features dimension input usually higher 
semantic annotation suffers training data scarcity problem slightly different way 
technically feasible label large number training images doing economically practical

consider approaches address training data scarcity challenge 
training instances select choose informative useful instances learning target concept 
second selected instances infer additional training instances increasing third dimensionality reduction methods employed reducing approach 
making instances useful challenge query concept learning find relevant objects concept boundary identified 
finding relevant object difficult small fraction dataset satisfies target concept 
instance suppose number desired objects image dataset 
randomly select objects round users identify relevant objects probability finding positive sample rounds random sampling just clearly acceptable 
improve odds intelligent sampling method maximizing expected generalization algorithm finds relevant instances quickly initialize query concept learning 
models query concepts cnf formulate virtually practical query concepts 
uses dnf bound sampling space select informative samples soliciting user feedback 
samples labeled negative user mega uses negative labeled instances irrelevant instances shrink sampling space making dnf specific 
increase probability finding relevant instances feedback iteration 
relevant irrelevant instances identified employ active refine class boundary 
intuitively active works combining ideas 
active regards task learning target concept learning svm binary classifier

approach 
increasing counter intuitive may sound scarcity negative training instances problematic scarcity positive training instances learning algorithms 
describing concept tigers may challenging describing negated concept case non tiger concept require potentially infinite information 
number images needed adequately portray tiger concept finite number non tiger images infinite 
negative training instances significantly easier come time number negative samples needed depict negated concept large 
need substantial number negative training instances accurately characterize class boundary 
revisit active algorithm 
round sampling selects objects margin close dividing hyperplane 
margin wide lack support negative side probability low positive training instance wide margin 
goal find positive training instances depict target concept 
difficulty gathering sufficient negative training instances slows progress finding positive training instances 
learning process analogous mining gold stream 
productive way harvest gold relevant instances quickly filter water mud sand negative labeled instances 
solving problem insufficient training data transductive learning proposed different learning algorithms various applications 
basic idea transduction leverage unlabeled data near labeled data 
suppose nearest neighbors negative training instances negative 
neighboring instances substantially increase negative labeled pool 
transduction performed care mis labeling data caused wrong guesses degrade learning result 
performance transduction unfortunately consistently inconsistent 
performance application dependent dataset dependent 
image retrieval transduction may suitable reasons nearest neighbor sampling 
image query concepts convex reside continuously input space 
instance flowers different colors tend spread color feature dimension 
describe flower non flower concept need explore input space aggressively 
transductive learning exploits nearest neighborhood existing labeled instances 
suppose picture lake non flower instances labeled negative 
pictures neighboring lake picture contain lakes visually similar may productive refining description negated concept non flower 
noise factor 
mislabeled data due noise reduce prediction accuracy classifier 
norm case relevant images rare performing transduction runs high risk introducing false relevant instances reduces class prediction accuracy 
propose employing training increase meaningful accurate way 
problem large unlabeled sample pool boost performance learning algorithm considered framework cotraining 
broad definition training provide instance multiple distinct views 
distinct views provided different learning algorithms active time 
information sharing distinct views increase especially pool 
propose training method provides training instance distinct views subspace learning boost pool negative labeled instances 
query concept learning scenario percentage positive labeled instances rare boosting positive pool directly may productive 
attempt boost negative pool probability finding positive instances increased
