sensor platform current sensor platform called multi modal sensor board shown 
sensor board equipped sensors allowing measure audio axis acceleration barometric pressure temperature humidity compass heading light level 
transmit data wired link ipaq laptop send data wirelessly bluetooth connection cell phone laptop intel mote communication 
current platform sample transmit data wirelessly nokia cell phone approximately hours batteries shown mahr li ion cells 
connected ipaq continuously sample store data hours 

initial experiments initial large data collection experiment conducted undergraduate students university washington collected hours data course weeks 
undergraduate wore sensor board shoulder performed various indoor outdoor activities 
wore small web camera assist currently unable send raw audio signals wirelessly bluetooth annotating data ground truth 
undergraduates collected data fairly unstructured manner simply instructed go collect data various activities 
completing data collection runs data downloaded desktop reviewed video sensor data added appropriate ground truth annotations 
set sensor data various activities ground truth annotations developed machine learning approach extract useful information sensors learn characteristic patterns recognize various activities details algorithm detailed results available 
sensor data able infer basic physical activities including activities sitting standing walking jogging walking stairs walking stairs riding bicycle driving riding car riding elevator riding elevator currently able recognize activities better accuracy 
example trace sensor data shown 
looking labeled sensor segments see patterns sensor data correspond labels 
example areas periodic acceleration activity generally walking activities involve walking stairs riding elevators generally show changes barometric pressure 
distinguish elevator rides stair climbing events looking accelerometer readings air pressure see areas accelerometer activity fig 
multi modal sensor board bluetooth enclosed waist worn box wireless monitoring slow pressure changes tend correspond walking stairs areas little acceleration rapid pressure changes tend correspond elevator rides

red lines represent ground truth video assisted annotations blue line represents final classification 
ground truth classification results tend line fairly addition final classification provides smooth transition activities 

steps investigating potential usage scenarios sensor platform activity inference techniques study obesity inducing factors including amount exercise people typically engage study detection events chronic pulmonary disease project aimed motivating physical activity people everyday lives called ubiquitous fitness influencing technology 
projects platform algorithms assist everyday fitness medical health monitoring unobtrusive wearable form factor shown 
allow test usability devices normal everyday targeted patient populations 
obesity inducing factors currently researchers study obesity rely coarse measurements activity physical fitness 
typically involve census interview data self reporting surveys collected study participants 
methods provide useful data coarse manner prone errors 
researchers working intend sensor platform volunteers study fine grain level amount exercise get everyday lives 
combining activity logs census data allow researchers better understand obesity studying different environments affect physical activity 
chronic pulmonary disease second project involves study early detection chronic pulmonary disease 
centers disease control prevention cdc affects approximately adults united states year responsible deaths hospital visits fig 
ground truth indicated thick red line final classification result indicated thin connected blue line shown sample segment data 
see blue laps red time emergency room visits 
goal study determine possible detect onset pulmonary event patients looking reductions amount activity person performs 
believed episodes preceded reduced physical activity 
typically result emergency room visit damage patients lungs 
patients typically aware impending early detection possible provide treatment patients avoid emergency room visits extend patients lives reducing number 
part previous pilot study colleague uw medical school conducted month experiment tracked physical activity individuals commercial accelerometer 
unfortunately data provided finegrain provide conclusive evidence allow development early warning techniques 
currently collaborating sensor platform series experiments see platform provide useful information study 
hope platform able detect changes behavior allow develop algorithms early detection 
third project called ubiquitous fitness influencing technology researchers intel research seattle uw exploring technology motivate people increase level physical activity 
example studies shown health benefits cutting risk cancer diabetes heart disease result merely increasing number steps person takes day 
additionally agencies recommended social support help increase level physical activity 
user study researchers drawing observations develop cell phone application help people share daily step count fitness buddies friends social network 
researchers investigate sharing step count progress goals affects participants daily step counts 
investigate motivations increasing physical activity competition personal awareness rewards 

working building new sensor system data collection local processing storage communication capabilities 
platform sensor board similar shown connected newly developed platform called 
intel xscale system board radio 
additional bluetooth sd card storage board new platform allow develop self contained data collection system provide power analyze data real time 
ability store data real time allow develop interesting set applications motivating physical activity day providing feedback amount exercise accomplished day platform easier deploy devices individuals brings closer idea having cell phone platform inference algorithms run 
addition new platform seeking validate methods comparing gold standard medical community measuring volume oxygen moving lungs 
measurements obtained having individuals wear breathing apparatus measures flow air person performs number different activities
