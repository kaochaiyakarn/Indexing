scaling estimate index pages yields deep web sources 
simple scaling numbers statistically accurate true unique aggregator numbers show serve illustrate scale data 
aware previous study number web forms estimated forms consider filters led final estimate 
put estimate perspective consider deep web source may lead large amount content single form car site leads hundreds thousands pages 
amount content deep web potentially huge 
addition large number observed semantic content deep web sites varies widely 
sources information geographically specific locators chain stores businesses local services doctors lawyers architects schools tax offices 
sources provide access reports statistics analysis generated governmental non governmental organizations 
course sources offer product search 
long tail sources offer access variety data art collections public records photo galleries bus schedules fact deep web sites categories odp directory 
indexing deep web estimated number forms web clearly lies potential structured data techniques 
consider direct question go making content deep web searchable general purpose search engines 
typical solution promoted web data integration creating virtual schema particular domain mappings fields forms attributes virtual schema 
query time user fills form domain interest query reformulated relevant forms 
fact specific domains travel jobs approach create vertical search engines 
example predecessor current efforts created web site www com offering integration newspaper online classified sites domains 
site constructed creating mappings sites carefully designed mediated schemata 
semiautomated schema mapping techniques described able quickly incorporate different form sites matter man months 
general web search approach limitations 
limitation number domains web large precisely defining boundaries domain tricky 
infeasible design virtual schemata provide broad web search content 
schemata exist definitely leverage 
second limitation amount information carried source descriptions 
creating mappings fields mediated schema attributes done scale source descriptions need detailed number sites relevant query typically large 
numbers queries major search engine absolutely critical send relevant queries deep web sites crash 
example car site important know geographical locations cars advertising distribution car database 
additional knowledge engine may impose excessive loads certain web sites 
virtual approach search engine reliant performance deep web sources typically satisfy latency requirements web search engine 
third limitation reliance structured queries 
queries web typically sets keywords need conduct reformulation identifying relevant domain query mapping keywords query fields mediated schema 
hard problem general typically requires knowledge contents data source values acceptable particular input field 
disadvantages led consider surfacing approach deep web content 
approach deep web content surfaced simulating form submissions retrieving answer pages putting web index 
main advantage surfacing approach ability re existing indexing technology additional indexing structures necessary 
search dependent run time characteristics underlying sources form submissions simulated line fetched crawler time 
deep web source accessed user selects web page crawled source user gets date content 
similarly problem identifying relevant deep web sites avoided web search performed html pages 
terms schemata source descriptions needs surfacing approach lighter 
creating schemata individual domains providing detailed source descriptions identify way crawling data filling values subset form fields sense finding access path data 
approach easily applied broader collection domains 
surfacing deep web content searchable important disadvantages 
significant lose semantics associated pages surfacing ultimately putting html pages web index 
doing overlook possibility exploiting structure query time 
possible enumerate data values sense particular form easy create form submissions relevant particular source 
example trying possible car models zip codes site create form submissions number larger number cars sale united states 
deep web sources surfaced sites robots txt forms post method surfaced 
ideally solution arbitrary user keyword query identify just right sources relevant results reformulate query structured query relevant sources retrieve results user 
problem identifying relevant sources user keyword queries call query routing key web scale data integration solution discuss 
currently pursuing surfacing approach step exploring solution space context deep web 
google base second source structured data web profile google base displays high degree heterogeneity 
detail degree heterogeneity describe challenges poses web scale data integration 
google base offering google lets users upload structured data google 
intention google base data 
addition mundane popular product data contains data concerning matters clinical trials event announcements exotic car parts people profiles 
google indexes data supports simple structured queries 
users describe data upload google base item type attribute value pairs 
example classified advertisement honda civic item type vehicle attributes honda model civic 
google base recommends popular item types attribute names users free invent 
users fact invent item types labels leading heterogeneous collection data 
result google base large self describing semi structured heterogeneous database 
item corresponding schema item type attribute names 
semi structured heterogeneous lack restrictions names values 
content heterogeneity heterogeneity google base occurs level item types attributes attribute values 
year launch google base contains item types contribute unique schemata unique set attribute names associated item 
item types items 
popular item types products reviews vehicles housing large number esoteric item types high performance car parts marine engine parts 
addition sheer complexity handling number item types see new challenges schema management relating google base 
large number item types form specialization hierarchy 
example item alternately described product car part high performance car part 
users choose different item types naturally leads proliferation item types 
second addition naturally occurring heterogeneity find heterogeneity occurs different malicious way 
users provide different item type names attribute names attempt improve ranking 
witnessing kind database design masses 
returning main themes result challenges need different approach schema management context web understand high degree heterogeneity 
get feel attribute level heterogeneity looked items type vehicle distinct attribute names occur items 
large number core set attributes appear large number items 
includes common attributes model location color price 
commonly occurring type attribute level heterogeneity complex attributes 
example color items includes internal color external color vehicle separate attributes 
heterogeneity level attribute values considered different values attribute color vehicles different colors items 
addition frequent colors silver white black cars colors polished light pearl metallic 
interesting heterogeneity challenge arises extrapolation domain specific similarities attribute values polished similar metallic silver incorporating similarities query processing 
note presence structure values mentioned case colors cars possible consider performing reconciliation domain specific similarity measures 
reconciliation possible purely unstructured data 
querying google base contents structured principle expected google base support querying 
web search users typically prefer keyword queries cases possess expertise pose defined structured queries 
result google base faces main challenges query routing determine relevant item types query refinement interactively construct specified structured queries 
illustrate challenges describing modes querying google base supports increasing levels difficulty 
mode querying user specifies particular item type provides values attributes 
essentially structured query google base tries help user refine proposing set attributes drop lists candidate values 
example choosing vehicle item type leads possible refinements attributes model color location 
user continue restrict search results choosing specific values drop downs attributes 
successive user refinement google base recomputes set candidate refinements 
google base proposes query refinements computing histograms attributes values query time 
chooses attributes best help user refine current query 
example user interested honda civic location restricted mountain view ca drop values color change reflect colors honda available mountain view area 
second mode querying user poses keyword query google base 
method main mode querying base google com 
google base suggest set item types show user example answers 
google base faces problem query routing different item types 
example query honda civic google base proposes item types vehicle review 
choosing suggested item types user restricts search results items chosen type 
third mode querying far common keyword query main search engine google com 
user may aware existence google base looking answer may relevant 
addition challenging query routing problem determining engine send query google base problem ranking answers properties 
instance query honda civic mountain view ca may return answers multiple item types google base listings honda dealers bay area stored google local database web documents may highly ranked query 
iteratively proposing chosen query refinements google base enables users construct structured queries 
better defined queries ability domain specific similarity measures ranking criteria lead enhancement search experience 
discussion demonstrates ability exploit structure observe google base queries structured data complete knowledge 
case general web data integration solution knowledge exist 
solution incorporate sources source descriptions summarized data contents 
setting heterogeneity challenges evidence google base 
annotation schemes growing fraction structured data web content created variety annotation schemes 
annotation schemes enable users add tags describing underlying content photos products reviews urls enable better search content 
flickr service yahoo 
prime example annotation service photo collections 
von ahn took idea level showing mass collaboration create high quality annotations photos 
google created google op service enables users create customized search engines see data cs washington edu coop index html search engine developed database research community

example case database research facets include professor project publication jobs 
web pages fit various categories manually annotated annotate homepage database faculty facet professor pages appear dblp facet tion 
annotations uploaded xml format google op 
annotations query web pages specify particular facet refine results returned earlier query 
facets automatically triggered search data integration publications tion facet triggered answers include pages annotated publications 
important point note annotations lightweight annotate facet page belongs 
integration problems faced context annotation schemes somewhat simpler 
typically annotations improve recall ranking resources little meta data associated photos videos 
case google op customized search engines specify query patterns trigger specific facets provide hints re ranking search results 
annotations customized search engine specifies visible context search engine 
start seeing custom search engines desirable point users different engines relevant

repository tracks lineage mappings system mapping changed mappings depend reconsidered 
schema clustering mapping relationships schemata specified terms semantic mappings clustering 
schema clustering represent schema set feature vectors structure data information data sources determining clusters 
vector extracts features schema data represented schema 
design customized scoring mechanisms compare feature vectors determine distance schemata 
set major features consider comparison mechanisms adopt include schema attribute names vector compared linguistic similarities data values vector compared linguistics similarities data type matching sets commonly occurring keyword groups 
features establish large graph schemata edge weights denoting distance schemata 
create clusters detecting groups schemata closely connected graph 
schema mapping employ corpus schema matching technique leverage large number schemata produce mappings

query reformulation answering queries paygo system posed keywords 
query answering component begins generating structured query query routing relevant sources ranking answers coming multiple sources 
describe preliminary algorithm answering queries paygo system 
particular algorithm illustrates novel components architecture interact 
example query honda civic review description 
step 
classify keywords divide keywords query corresponding data values corresponding attribute names schema elements 
example honda civic values model respectively review attribute name 
course keywords play multiple roles 
values multiple domains classic jaguar example serve data values attribute names 
classification look keywords indexes provided repository structure index indexes schema elements data sources value index indexes data values 
step 
choose domain schema clusters determine domains user query corresponds 
step proceeds lookup domain index indexes structure terms associated cluster domain 
note structure term belong different domains 
example find review model belong vehicle domain 
keep domains deemed relevant query 
step 
generate structured queries generate candidate structured queries relevant domain trying match keywords query common attribute names domain 
step utilizes algorithms answering queries approximate schema mapping 
example honda civic review transformed model review vehicle domain 
possibly structured queries record degree certainty mapping

user selects refinement query obtain feedback query structuring mechanisms 
cases may able solicit explicit help user asking questions regarding system understanding underlying data mapping correct 
web scale far possible questions ask user challenge determine questions ask 
challenge compounded fact multiple different types questions generated different mechanisms compared schema mapping questions versus entity resolution questions 
approach solving problem employ decision theory determine questions ask user principled manner 
step translating problem decision theoretic terms quantify benefit utility question terms apply multiple types questions produced different mechanisms 
goal system provide better ideally perfect answers user queries define utility function captures user satisfaction queries 
function numerical value quantifies answer quality precision recall measure average precision 
outcome question known advance system take account uncertainty associated question 
instance uncertain mapping expected gain utility small asking question gain little information 
decision theory formalizes process calculation value perfect information vpi 
basically vpi score question states expected benefit knowing correct answer question uncertainty outcome question potential benefit possible outcomes 
currently developing decision framework utilizes formalisms provide system ranked set questions ask user
