increasing interest configuration similarity currently developing context digital libraries spatial databases geographical information systems 
corresponding queries retrieve database configurations match input description find configurations object km turn inside object 
introduces framework configuration similarity takes account major types spatial constraints topological direction distance 
define appropriate fuzzy similarity measures type constraint provide flexibility allow system capture real life needs 
apply pre processing techniques explicate constraints query algorithms effectively solve problem
