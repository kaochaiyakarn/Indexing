exploring agent conversation context fine grained agent coordination research raised intellectual questions 
major issues pertain interactions different agent conversations representations chosen different classes conversations explicit modeling interactions conversations address interactions 
ambitious attempt address questions frame context quantified scheduling centric multi agent coordination research 
long history agents agent control components building distributed ai multi agent systems attempting frame address set intellectual questions pertaining agent conversation 
interaction lies heart matter issue interaction different agent conversations possibly occur different levels abstraction interaction machinery holding conversation agents underlying machinery controlling individual agent 
question appropriate interface conversation machinery lower level control components 
consider situation approaches issue different perspective 
agent hard deadline looming lacks sufficient time coordinate soft task interactions optional coordination points modulate conversation machinery reflect upcoming deadline 
options include conversational activities existing dialogues starting new dialogues modifying conversations reflect need 
case involves simply terminating standard dialogues second case requires dialogues parameterized include branches different temporal requirements possibly anytime nature :10.1.1.47.4260
problem neat cyclical 
non local information obtained communication influences agent beliefs impacts intentions planned actions 
continuing dialogue gaining information change choices agent result agent having time conversations 
conversely time spent conversing may simply domain problem solving 
example cur issue clear resources simple objects require exclusive access sharable network bandwidth performance action resource may degrade state resource degrees degradation vary

alternative provide lower level feasibility implementation tools larger view space candidate tasks 
model lower level tools provide guidance tasks pursued higher levels analysis 
note case upper lower levels essentially information just different levels abstraction 
conversation machinery 
require negotiation style interface different conversational levels :10.1.1.121.1570
different conversational machinery different levels conversation 
begins regarding agent conversation stratified levels obvious 
organizing computation organizing multi agent systems obviously entails conversations take place higher level abstraction 
conversations agents determine structure problem solving take place
