expressive wrapper classes kushmerick initial investigation lr family wrappers substantial research effort elaborating various alternative wrapper classes deriving efficient learning algorithms 
kushmerick various extended wrapper classes taken consideration numerous limitations 
muslea hsu dung developed various wrapper learning algorithms address shortcomings missing attributes :10.1.1.56.7152:10.1.1.56.7152:10.1.1.51.8159
complicated pages may involve missing null attribute values 
corresponding delimiters missing simple wrapper process remainder page correctly 
example french commerce site specify country addresses outside france 
multi valued attributes 
example extract name restaurant review simpler scan scan big position scan font force wrapper scan document single delimiter reliably indicates extracted content 
hierarchically organized data 
kushmerick nested classes step handling non tabular data results largely negative 
complicated scenarios need extraction nested embedded structure 
hsu dung addresses problem learning wrappers correspond expressive class deterministic finite state transducers :10.1.1.51.8159
