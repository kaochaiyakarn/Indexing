composable ad hoc mobile services universal interaction todd hodes randy katz schreiber lawrence rowe computer science division university california berkeley hodes randy larry cs berkeley edu august introduces notion universal interaction allowing device adapt functionality exploit services discovers moves new environment 
users wish invoke services controlling lights printing locally reconfiguring location dns servers mobile devices 
priori standardization interfaces methods service invocation infeasible 
challenge develop new service architecture supports heterogeneity client devices controlled objects minimal assumptions standard interfaces control protocols 
components comprehensive solution problem allowing device mobility augmenting controllable objects network accessible building underlying discovery architecture mapping exported object interfaces client device controls building complex behaviors underlying composable objects
