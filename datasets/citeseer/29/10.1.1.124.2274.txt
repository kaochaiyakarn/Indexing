improving min max aggregation spatial objects zhang computer science department university california riverside ca cs ucr edu examine problem computing min max aggregates collection spatial objects 
spatial object associated weight value example average temperature rainfall area covered object 
query rectangle min max problem computes minimum maximum weight objects intersecting query rectangle 
traditionally queries performed range search queries 
assuming objects indexed spatial access method min max computed objects retrieved 
requires effort proportional number objects intersecting query interval may large 
aggregation point objects special case orthogonal range searching received vast attention past years field computational geometry

solutions utilize variation range tree ben multi dimensional divide conquer technique 
database field jl proposed tree stores aggregated results index 
proposed selectively traverse multi dimensional index problem selectivity estimation corresponding count aggregate :10.1.1.21.848
lm proposed multi resolution aggregate tree mra tree augments index records tree aggregate information points record sub tree 
mra tree uses selective traversal provide estimate aggregation result 
result progressively refined 
jl proposes performance model estimate performance index structures aggregated data 
experimental comparison showed approach provides drastic improvement especially query sizes increase 
product showed optimizations applied improve existing aggregation index tree
