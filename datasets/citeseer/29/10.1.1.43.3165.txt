recognizing user transactions performance management jl hellerstein ts ibm thomas watson research center new york ibm com providing quality service low response times distributed computer systems requires measuring user perceptions performance 
unfortunately practice measures expensive impossible obtain 
propose machine learning approach recognizing user transactions consisting sequences remote procedure calls rpcs received server 
problems addressed 
labeling previously segmented transaction instances correct transaction type 
akin done document classification 
applying naive bayes feature vectors requires having way estimate conditional probability rpc type occurring instance transaction type 
occurrences bernoulli distribution 
combination rpc type transaction type estimate ij jt ij rpc type occurred transaction instance type 
counts need estimate ij jt value ij ij number rpcs type transaction instance type approach estimation problems consider parametric distributions
