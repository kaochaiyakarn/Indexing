accordingly approaches help users coping high volume conversational data information overload situations try partly automate information seeking process matching models user interests potentially interesting documents :10.1.1.30.8904
considering frame problem inherent dynamic interests suggests assumptions possible user motivation actual interests 
consequently main difference situated information filtering approach traditional information filtering approaches data user behavior interpreted data exploited filtering 
situated information filtering approach consider assumed interests users content selected documents 
situated information filtering helps user focus potentially interesting articles reducing filtering amount uninteresting data 
extended user experiments preparation find extent situated filtering perspective reasonably exploited 
currently focus usenet believe situated perspective valuable domains information overload situations email www 
notion situatedness introduces important perspective technology driven largely internet culture 
related different perspective strongly influenced results research situated cognition situated filtering approach shares similarities traditional recommender information filtering approaches 
similar advanced filtering recommending approaches usenet domain www domain situated information filtering system exploits data gained free monitoring user behavior :10.1.1.30.8904
user actions approaches try infer user interested 
different avoids infer user interests 
contrary supports user focusing potentially interesting discussions filtering discussions shown uninteresting 
recommender systems directly deal objects consideration 
recommender systems ratings profiles avoids abstraction step 
interestingness discussions solely interaction user available discussions 
course user actions interpreted meaning projected actions interpretations infer user interested 
consequences interpretations weak interactivity ensures allows user accept reject indicated consequences 
particular shares basic assumptions mentioned systems letizia :10.1.1.30.8904
systems aim supporting user completely automating task hand 
systems try best limited resource user user attention 
systems try keep context recommendations letizia provides line support user browsing www usenet articles artificial special interest newsgroups
