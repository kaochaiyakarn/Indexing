automatic annotation environmental metadata using topic similarity c users szt downloads onemercuryfrontpage jpg rapid growth diverse data types greater volumes available environmental sciences prompts scientists seek knowledge data multiple places times scales facilitate need onemercury recently implemented part dataone project serve portal accessing environmental observational data across globe onemercury harvests metadata data hosted multiple repositories makes searchable however harvested metadata records sometimes poorly annotated lacking meaningful keywords hence unlikely retrieved search process paper develop algorithm automatic metadata annotation transform problem tag recommendation problem propose score propagation style algorithm tag recommendation experiments four data sets environmental science metadata records show great promises performance method also shed light different natures data sets problem linking data heterogenous sources always cost one biggest problems onemercury facing different levels annotation harvested metadata records poorly annotated metadata records tend missed search process lack meaningful keywords furthermore records compatible advance mode offered onemercury requires metadata records semantically annotated keywords keyword library explosion amount metadata records harvested increasingly number data repositories makes even impossible annotate harvested records manually hand urging need tool capable automatically annotating poorly curated metadata records proposed solution transform problem tag recommendation problem

document query documents source tfidf based first measure relies term frequency inverse document frequency order compute inverse document frequency documents source need first indexed use lingpipe
