emsl currentlyfacing following problems resource usage emsl hosts cutting edge bi ology chemistry experimental resources tract enormous amount scientists needing access resources oftentimes resources limited allocated whose proposals approved remote data access sharing scientists physical access facility may inquirethattheexperimentsbedone remotelyontheir behalf however sending experimental data back requesting scientists can problematic since one conventional method delivering digitalized data moreover data packages bigger allowed email attachment sizes making transporting data packages via emails feasible massive data experiment emsl stores digitalized data backups knowledge mining applications cowley reported tb digi talized data produced daily also projected data produced daily emsl will become large tb calls system ef ciently manages ever increasing amount data also makes readily accessible redundant data oftentimes scientists perform sets experiments done resulting inef cient use resources also redundant data storage mitigate problems emsl recently initiated myemsl data management system serves portal accessing experimental data produced emsl myemsl collects experimental
