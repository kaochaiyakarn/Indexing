data model data structures moving objects databases luca ralf hartmut guting enrico markus schneider consider spatio temporal databases supporting spatial objects continuously changing position extent termed moving objects databases 
formally define data model databases includes complex evolving spatial structures line networks multi component regions holes 
data model collection data types operations plugged attribute types dbms data model relational object oriented obtain complete model query language 
particular novel concept sliced representation represents temporal development set units unit types spatial data types represent certain simple functions time 
show model mapped concrete physical data structures dbms environment 
wide increasing range database applications deal spatial objects position extent changes time
