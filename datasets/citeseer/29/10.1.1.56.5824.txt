web database querying differs significantly querying conventional database 
essential aspects query web different query standard database lack concurrency control limited data access capabilities 
consider impact lack concurrency control queries effectively evaluated 
give characterizations web queries terms sub web depend terms reflective relational machines 
node link relations finite model access restrictions imply certain queries evaluated non terminating computation 
example query list nodes computed enumerating possible url testing corresponds node way 
abiteboul vianu call queries eventually computable section characterize monotonicity property new kind reflective relational machine

calculus essentially order logic plus regular expressions specify paths nodes 
show properly restricted full calculus express queries web queries find nodes incoming links 
syntactic restrictions needed express web queries various classes eventually computable queries 
particular define safe calculus formulas show express exactly computable web queries expressible calculus 
corollary generic boolean query schema db empty

web calculus section study particular query language light various classes queries described previous sections

websql integrates content retrieval provided index servers web structure retrieval 
example suppose want find documents title containing string formal models web queries database reached computer science department home page paths length leaving local server

essentially order logic enriched path expressions 
vocabulary includes predicates base relation fr rn node link predicates web relations path predicate asserts existence path links web nodes gives full language higher expressive power order

ensure argument path atom bound known set nodes similar called source safety :10.1.1.11.3892
second usual relational calculus ensure arguments negated atom instantiated terms disjunction set variables 
restrictions specified follows 
definition formula safe web calculus formula web calculus forms

dynamic vs static queries query engines web websql ql provide query languages specify user requests :10.1.1.11.3892
