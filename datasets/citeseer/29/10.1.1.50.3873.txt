developing theory generic representation shape structural descriptions derived shocks singularities curve evolution process acting bounding contours 
apply theory problem shape matching 
shocks organized directed acyclic shock graph complexity managed attending significant central shape components 
space graphs highly structured characterized rules shock graph grammar 
grammar permits reduction shock graph unique rooted shock tree 
techniques typically difficult extend natural objects 
computer vision approaches view modeling fall broadly classes 
feature methods represent view collection line segments curves corners regions 
success methods depends largely extent features reliably extracted easily applied natural objects 
second number appearance methods emerged essentially treat raw image single feature high dimensional space :10.1.1.12.7580
techniques succeed recognizing particulars specific class faces predict entry level categories abstraction image data model 
returning problem database organization techniques succeed finding specific instances loki body database photographs animals fail separating example photographs horses photographs hands 
important contrast boundary techniques discussed earlier blum medial axis transform skeleton preceded rosch decade 
blum skeleton area provides description shapes loci centers covering balls
