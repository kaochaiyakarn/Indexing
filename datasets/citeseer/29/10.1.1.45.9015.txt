uniformity independence analysis trees concept fractal dimension christos faloutsos kamel department computer science institute systems research isr univ maryland college park february propose concept fractal dimension set points order quantify deviation uniformity distribution 
measurements real data sets road intersections star coordinates nasa infrared explorer provide evidence real data skewed show behave mathematical fractals measurable non integer fractal dimension 
armed tool show practical predicting performance spatial access methods specifically trees 
provide analysis trees skewed distributions points develop formula estimates number disk accesses range queries fractal dimension point set count 
experiments real data sets show formula accurate relative error usually rarely exceeds 
believe fractal dimension help replace uniformity independence assumptions allowing accurate analysis spatial access method better estimates query optimization multi attribute queries
