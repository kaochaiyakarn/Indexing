smartpush architecture part smartpush project implement working prototype information targeting environment 
underlying goal develop framework content producer provide multitude different customized information feeds user filter different incoming feeds get personalized information service 

main agent types 
architecture rests assumptions semantic metadata 
firstly assume possible create domain specific ontology capable expressing different facets user decides interest information item 
secondly assume possible commercially viable enhance content metadata descriptions created 
smartpush relies high quality metadata representation content 
think content producers sources metadata flows describe new content producers multimedia databases 
flow distributed interested parties acts advertisement actual content 
metadata flow tell content delivered user 
type system implemented monolithic information system central database system relatively independent software entities 
believe today networked information marketplace rigid centralized system keep changes environment 
content providers longer control distribution chain 
internet service providers portal managers interfacing user need professional high quality content 
growing need distributed system channels high quality content right users 
smartpush system exist different major agent types 
tasks involved managing user profiles matching incoming metadata records delivering information user divided different processes 
facilitating dynamic collaboration agents need coordination agent ontology agents 
division tasks different agents allows flexibility distributing processing load changing flow information fly distributing tasks organizational boundaries 
profile agent profile agent tasks involve managing profile user information 
new user enters system needs fresh profile created ways 
example user rank sample documents system derives profile information 
user give explicit keywords describing profile pick prototype profiles baseline profile start adapt 
interest profile created needs stored permanently 
user needs specify options delivering results information filtering process 
profile contains information system act sufficiently interesting material appears 
system judges user interest incoming document exceeds certain threshold take direct action sending email message deliver suggestion 
example passive delivery option keeping list interesting suggestions user retrieve discretion 

profile agent administration view 
adaptation important part system requires implicit explicit feedback user 
user gives feedback system document suggestions profile agent job modify contents interest profile better line feedback received time 
means profile agent may need maintain explicit feedback history history documents suggested user user reactions 
depending implementation adaptation algorithm history information may stored summary form complete log 
location profile agent content provider mediator consumer chain bearing functions possible 
profile stored managed user machine 
discloses little information possible user aspects inter agent communication social filtering harder implement 
furthermore user carry device containing profile system mobile platform different locations 
distributed profile management software upgrades troublesome 
decision profile agent network hosted information broker 
profile agents provide services users manage profiles modify profiles users interact system 
user contact agent wants changes independent location available bandwidth device 
separating different functions delivery chain necessitates trusting party profile agent user interest information 
user identity hidden matching agent content provider needed 
database covering users profiles provides foundation exploring social information filtering shardanand maes 
similarities profiles detect common areas interest uncovered individual profiles 
users benefit analysis profile database getting suggestions missed 
matching agent actual matching process carried matching agent 
interaction profile agent matching agent functions subscribe unsubscribe basis profile agent expresses user interest areas sending compact interest representation 
matching agent sees user identification code interest profile possible delivery options minimum interest value defined incoming suggestions 

matching agent status view 
task matching agent compare incoming metadata records base registered profiles 
agent listens incoming metadata decodes parses arrives compares profile 
comparisons distance measure measures far document profile 
developed asymmetric distance measure considers document fits part profile kurki 
best matching document cover areas user interest 
systems symmetric distance measure cosine measure term vector model 

example suggestions distance measures 
optimized computations required scalable matching process 
model content description hierarchic summarizes user interest top level categories 
offers natural way limit number profiles considered possible matches 
agent take account profiles common document top level hierarchy 
delivery agent matching agent decided suggest certain user hands delivery agent 
delivery agent role deliver suggestion user user delivery options 
delivery agent different modules actors communicating suggestions user 
delivery process involve way communication relatively restricted channel 
example user ask current suggestions sending short message mobile phone delivery agent return suggestion list 
basic idea separate delivery agent separate user communication details relatively high level interagent communications 
way new communication interaction mechanisms added changes basic setup 
ontology agent incoming metadata flow profiles managed profile agent common representations matching agent able comparisons meaningful way 
matching agent understands digital representations compatible conceptual level 
doubt creating universal conceptual model wide scale adoption single model impossible real world 
need take account need ontology agents able translate different representations available different content producers 
ontology agent able offer partial bridge semantic islands system remains specific single source information 
coordination agent individual agents need discover need coordination agent 
case example dynamic new ontologies delivery services necessitates system new services announce availability contact information central coordination agent acts clearinghouse current capabilities system 
linear distribution chain consisting single triple matching agent profile agent delivery agent really need automatic coordination techniques 
agents interconnections hard coded set dynamic reconfiguration
