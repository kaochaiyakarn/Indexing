qos management web real time data services son don kang department computer science university virginia kk vg cs virginia edu demand real time data services increasing 
commerce applications webbased information services sophisticated data needs 
span spectrum low level status data stock prices high level aggregated data recommended selling buying point 
applications desired process user requests deadlines fresh data reflect current market status 
current web data services poor processing user requests timely manner fresh data 
address problem framework guaranteed real time data services unpredictable environments 
contrast temporal data object may change continuously reflect real world state current temperature stock prices 
temporal data object timestamp indicating latest observation real world state 
temporal consistency defined validity intervals real time database address consistency issue real world state reflected value database 
temporal data considered fresh temporally consistent absolute timestamp avi validity interval 
absolute validity interval length time temporal data object remains fresh :10.1.1.111.6193
temporal data classified base data derived data 
base data objects import view outside environment 
derived data object derived possibly multiple base derived data 
example composite index derived various stock prices

base data item directly associated absolute validity interval 
derived data object associated absolute relative validity intervals :10.1.1.111.6193
transaction types currently real time database model includes types transactions update transactions real time database base data objects updated periodically reflect current status real world environment current stock price 
update transactions write transactions specially designed purpose 
user transactions user transactions arrive 
user transactions write temporal data object read write non temporal data 
execution times data access patterns user transactions timevarying discussed
