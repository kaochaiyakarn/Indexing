comparison optimized backpropagation algorithms werner university koblenz institute physics rheinau koblenz mail uni koblenz de backpropagation famous training algorithms multilayer perceptrons 
unfortunately slow practical applications 
years improvement strategies developed speed backpropagation 
difficult compare different techniques tested various specific data sets 
reported results kind tiny artificial training sets xor encoder decoder 
doubtful results hold complicate practical application
