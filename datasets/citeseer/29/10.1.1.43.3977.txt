temporal databases propose formal notion temporal database captures representation independent meaning temporal database 
temporal database may viewed different equivalent ways 
model theoretic view basic treats temporal database order structure 
snapshot view treats function maps instant set tuples 
timestamp relation non nf relation values timestamp attribute sets instants 
clear views expressive power 
show table european history database viewed timestamp relation 
table fragment corresponding snapshot relation table relation part corresponding temporal structure 
multiple temporal dimensions multiple temporal dimensions necessary model intervals pairs points multiple kinds time valid time time fact holds real world transaction time time fact recorded database :10.1.1.136.4755
simplicity assume single temporal domain 
handle multiple temporal dimensions notion temporal database needs appropriately generalized obvious way
