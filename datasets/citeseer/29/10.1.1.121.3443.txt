school computer science carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa model decentralized problem solving called distributed constrained heuristic search provides structure focus individual agent search spaces optimize decisions global space 
model achieves integrating decentralized constraint satisfaction heuristic search 
formalism suitable describing large set dai problems 
introduce notion textures allow agents operate asynchronous concurrent manner 
employment textures coupled distributed asynchronous backjumping dab type distributed dependency directed backtracking developed enables agents instantiate variables way substantially reduce backtracking
