learning state estimation partially observable markovian decision processes singh singh mit edu jaakkola mit edu department brain cognitive sciences massachusetts institute technology cambridge ma michael jordan jordan mit edu reinforcement learning rl algorithms provide sound theoretical basis building learning control architectures embedded agents 
unfortunately theory practice see barto exception rl limited markovian decision processes mdps 
realworld decision tasks inherently non markovian state environment incompletely known learning agent 
consider partially observable mdps pomdps useful class non markovian decision processes 
previous approaches problems combined computationally expensive state estimation techniques learning control 
investigates learning pomdps resorting form state estimation
