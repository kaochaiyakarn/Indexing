attempt address complexity issues current software information processing software agents steadily finding way various applications 
research software agents termed interface user agents complex systems carry actions user behalf infancy 
previous systems agents fallen short providing adaptive collaborative robust autonomous agents :10.1.1.15.9305
agents pedagogical modeling small fraction possible actions narrowly focused results useful small number architectures

symbiotic information reasoning decision support driving goal research develop comprehensive software engineering knowledge engineering knowledge acquisition methodology symbiotic information reasoning decision support 
underlying idea allow human perform tasks agent perform tasks 
agents strength lies ability perform data acquisition management include display information heterogeneous sources low level quantitative qualitative data analysis routine inference enable decision support :10.1.1.56.2237
human strength lies ability provide guidance insight information necessary draw complex higher level inferences data 
symbiotic approach necessary objective user computer share task load human centered approach task partitioning 
requires development adaptive intelligent learning human computer interface 
intelligent agents key aspect perform information fusion analysis abstraction deriving information requirements controlling information display 
agent distinguish relevant features environment relationship method necessary act react environment 
concerning agent ability act react adaptivity requirement assumes agent capable effect environment acting reacting 
reactive behavior implies timely response stimulus response sensed events act deliberative reasoned response events 
relationship agent sensing acting reacting regards internal representation environment define properties agent 
goodwin defines deliberative agent properties include predictive ability model environment predict actions affect environment interpretive ability correctly assess sensors rational ability perform actions obtain goals :10.1.1.16.7163
predictive metric measures interface agent ability model environment predict actions affect environment 
define metric predictive number correct suggestions number suggestions metric account agent inability suggest assistance 
agent unable suggest assistance due slow reaction time metric measure

notes autonomy defined community 
franklin graesser argue autonomy implies reactive sensing acting time constraint temporally continuous goal oriented pro active agent :10.1.1.52.1255

desire agent able act behalf user told 
external measurement measure number suggestions agent offers user user request 
define metric follows external autonomy number autonomous suggestions number suggestions collaboration require interface agents collaborate user 
collaboration user best differentiates interface agents types agents 
collaboration may simple making suggestion user asking suggestion correct complicated observing user actions environment attempting determine needs intent user providing assistance appropriate times 
collaboration allows agents increase internal representation accuracy resolve conflicts inconsistencies representation improve decision support capabilities :10.1.1.36.7025
collaboration may non human agents 
heterogenous agents collaboration implies agreed agent communication language commitment language 
central collaboration behaviors agent perform protocol communicate behaviors :10.1.1.109.7954

attempt close ends looking agent utility meeting requirements 
utility function requirements defined requirement metrics agent weighted respect importance previous history 
requirements theta theta 
history previous actions events weighting factor requirement metrics utility function maps real number :10.1.1.50.1212
function time allow weights change depending current situation 
example interface agent making poor suggestions increase weight associated adaptivity requirement metrics denoting increased importance 
higher value utility interface agent successful meeting requirements
