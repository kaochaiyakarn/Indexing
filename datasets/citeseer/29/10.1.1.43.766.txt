issue discussed section 
note users typically request higher level changes lorel update language basic change operations defined reflect actual changes database level :10.1.1.45.8397
example 
consider modifications oem database example 
modifications running example rest 
january st price rating cuisine changed 

querying changes section seen history oem database represented corresponding doem database 
section describe doem databases queried 
introduce query language called chorel purpose 
chorel similar lorel language query oem databases :10.1.1.45.8397
brief overview lorel followed description syntax semantics chorel 

lorel overview lorel uses familiar select syntax thought extension oql major ways 
lorel encourages path expressions 
faced task comparing different types lorel tries coerce common type 
fail comparison simply returns false raising error 
behavior may unsuitable traditional databases exactly user expects querying semistructured data 
lorel provides number syntactic possibility omitting clause 
describe lorel detail see simple example features needed understand chorel :10.1.1.45.8397
example 
consider oem database depicted 
find restaurants price rating lorel query select guide restaurant guide restaurant price note query expresses price rating real number restaurant entries cuisine oem database shown integer string respectively 
furthermore third restaurant entry price subobject 
feature illustrated query uses time data variables select clause 
example 
referring doem database suppose want find names restaurants price ratings updated january st value greater time update new price 
query left select nv guide restaurant price upd nv guide restaurant name jan nv answer name cuisine update time jan new value result query single complex object components shown right 
label name chosen chorel method described :10.1.1.45.8397
time data variables labels specified query chorel chooses default labels create time add time remove time new value old value 

chorel semantics semantics chorel queries precise 
done lorel semantics described specifying rewriting chorel queries queries 
annotation expressions chorel query transformed canonical form includes variables 
example add rewritten add upd rewritten upd nv nv fresh variables 
lorel eliminate path expressions introducing variables objects inside path expressions 
example path expression clause converted new range variables 
details rewriting described :10.1.1.45.8397
stage give semantics range variable definitions may include annotation expressions label add label context doem database 
absence annotation expression semantics expression label binding bound objects oy arc labeled label ox oy current snapshot 
note theory practice object systems semantics standard lorel query annotations doem database exactly semantics query asked current snapshot doem database 
presence annotation expressions semantics requires existence specified annotation provides bindings variables annotation expression 
function analogous 
rewriting performed select clauses resulting query processed standard manner 
illustrated variables introduced clause interpreted 
variables may introduced clause 
treated introducing existential quantification clause extending treatment variables lorel :10.1.1.45.8397
consider example example 
consider doem database 
suppose want names restaurants moderate price subobject added january st 
write chorel query select guide restaurant name add price moderate jan variable introduced clause 
query language chorel enables querying data changes

demonstrated virtual annotations facilitate snapshot access historical database 
described design implementation query subscription service doem chorel 
plan investigate topics near extending chorel allow annotation expressions attached lorel wildcards regular expressions path expressions :10.1.1.45.8397
designing indexes annotations types timestamps studying indexes achieve efficient translation chorel queries lorel queries
