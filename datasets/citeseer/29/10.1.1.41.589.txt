easy get impression research reports statistical reasons believing overfitting avoidance strategies increase accuracy research community making progress developing powerful general methods overfitting inducing decision trees 
fact overfitting avoidance strategy amounts form bias may degrade performance improving 
pruning methods proven successful empirical tests due methods choice test problems

making progress methods powerful general 
widely noted researchers studying decision tree induction performance training data may misleading indication true predictive accuracy 
complex tree achieves high accuracy training set fare worse fresh data simple tree performed 
case researchers say complex tree overfit training data reflecting true underlying relationships patterns arising purely chance 
overfitting sense decreases predictive accuracy great deal effort expended developing overfitting avoidance methods tree induction generally form pruning strategies 
methods reported widely compared empirically researchers undertake decision tree induction relying form overfitting avoidance :10.1.1.167.3624
fact overfitting avoidance methods improved predictive accuracy induced decision trees methods inherently beneficial 
overfitting avoidance strategy amounts kind bias biases helpful appropriate domain application 
particular article meant show success decision tree pruning strategies published studies due entirely problems researchers chosen test 
alternative choices support best ignore overfitting presence noisy data simply choose tree considered best fits training set
