predicting performance linearly combined ir systems christopher vogt computer science engineering university california san diego www cs ucsd edu vogt cottrell computer science engineering university california san diego www cs ucsd edu gary introduce new technique analyzing combination models 
technique allows qualitative ir systems combined 
achieve linear regression accurately predict performance combined system quantitative measurements individual component systems taken trec 
applied linear model weighted sum relevance scores technique supports previously suggested hypotheses maximize individual systems performances overlap relevant documents systems minimizing overlap nonrelevant documents 
suggests new systems distribute scores similarly rank relevant documents similarly 
furthermore suggests linear model able exploit fraction benefit possible combination 
study lee attempted answer question 
lee different combination functions entries queries trec adhoc task 
combination techniques examined subset linear combination model min max simulated simple linear combination 
linear methods generally superior 
lee hypothesis suggested part combination warranted systems return similar sets relevant documents different sets nonrelevant documents :10.1.1.178.2444
basically asserts chorus effect primary source potential improvement 
lee defines measures amount overlap relevant nonrelevant documents rel defined 
formally analyze hypothesis correct able verify data performance best mixture fact negatively correlated correlation supports second half hypothesis 
unfortunately correlation rel performance mixture data support half hypothesis study show reason believe true 
analysis indicates linear model primarily takes advantage chorus effect 
involve sophisticated neural network models exploit skimming dark horse effects representations documents queries inputs combination model 
hope training techniques develop linear model generalize complicated models 
current focuses combining systems 
previous studies better comes number systems :10.1.1.178.2444
intend verify methodology similar 
ultimately hope shed light combination works works best
