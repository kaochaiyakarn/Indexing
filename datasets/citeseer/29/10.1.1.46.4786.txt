shared storage arrays enable thousands storage devices shared directly accessed hosts switched system area networks promising databases highly scalable reliable storage 
systems hosts perform access tasks read write management tasks migration reconstruction data failed devices 
task translates multiple phases low level device os concurrent host tasks span multiple shared devices access overlapping ranges potentially leading inconsistencies redundancy codes data read hosts 
highly scalable concurrency control recovery protocols required coordinate line storage management access tasks 
expressing storage level tasks acid transactions ensures proper concurrency control recovery approach imposes high performance overhead results replication exploit available knowledge storage level tasks
