individual image pixel classified belonging obstacle ground color appearance 
method uses single passive color camera performs real time provides binary obstacle image high resolution 
system easily trained simply driving robot environment 
adaptive mode system keeps learning appearance ground operation 
system tested successfully variety environments indoors outdoors 
shakey operated floor tiles obstacles easily detected applying edge detector monochrome input image 
shakey environment artificial 
obstacles non specular surfaces uniformly carefully selected colors 
addition lighting walls floor carefully set eliminate shadows
