address open challenge combination classifiers different performance characteristics effectively reduce performance variance average system classes including seen 
approach allows tune combination system available representative validation data obtain smaller performance degradation system evaluation data single method classifier 
tested approach applying nearest neighbor rocchio language modeling classifiers combination event tracking problem topic detection tracking tdt domain new classes events created constantly time representative validation sets new classes difficult obtain time 
parameters tuned early benchmark tdt corpus evaluated tdt benchmark corpus overlapping events observed reduction tracking cost weighted combination errors combined system individual methods evaluated conditions strongly suggesting robustness approach solution improving cross class performance consistency statistical classifiers standard cross validation fails due lack representative validation sets
