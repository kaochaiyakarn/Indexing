error correcting output coding corrects bias variance bae kong department computer engineering national university south korea ac kr thomas dietterich department computer science oregon state university corvallis cs orst edu previous research shown technique called error correcting output coding ecoc dramatically improve classification accuracy supervised learning algorithms learn classify data points ae classes 
presents investigation ecoc technique works particularly employed decision tree learning algorithms 
shows ecoc method form voting committee reduce variance learning algorithm 
furthermore methods simply combine multiple runs learning algorithm ecoc correct errors caused bias learning algorithm 
experiments show bias correction ability relies non local behavior 
error correcting output coding ecoc method applying binary class learning algorithms solve class supervised learning problems 
works converting class supervised learning problem large number class supervised learning problems 
learning algorithm handle class problems decision tree algorithm quinlan applied learn problems 
classify new test example learned decision trees evaluated 
ecoc method tells combine results evaluations predict class test example 
previous experimental research bakiri dietterich bakiri wettschereck dietterich dietterich bakiri shown error correcting output coding uniformly improves classification accuracy decision tree neural network classifiers compared standard approaches class learning problems :10.1.1.72.7289
goal explain ecoc method works 
shows ecoc strategy viewed compact form voting multiple hypotheses 
key success voting errors committed learned binary functions substantially uncorrelated 
explain ecoc strategy works explain learned binary functions uncorrelated errors 
bootstrap aggregation reduce bias reduce variance 
true homogeneous voting scheme algorithm applied multiple times data set 
multiple votes produce better approximations ideal probabilities change true values 
homogeneous voting reduce variance bias 
ecoc voting apply error correcting output coding method problem constructed bit error correcting code exhaustive method described dietterich bakiri :10.1.1.72.7289
understand error correcting code graphically considering shows decision boundaries 
decision boundary segment unique label boundaries separating class class 
apply multiclass problem forced learn decision boundaries simultaneously 
contrast ecoc method important properties
