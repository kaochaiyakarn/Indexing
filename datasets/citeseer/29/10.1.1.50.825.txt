overcome drawbacks lack schema information proposals second approach extended exible schema mechanism able represent information data leaving high degree freedom respect data entered database 
important issue quite independent modeling approach adopted capture existence regularity data typing data approach classifying 
knowledge assume approach occurs practice instance integrating semi structured data discovered web data having known structure semi structured data associated kind structural information example document type de nition associated xml page 
speci ed insertion new objects schema set result schema modi cations attribute domains kept account 
classi cation approach proposed context data model 
data model includes new types ensuring highly exible type system 
particular modeling power comparable best known data models semi structured data captures kinds data heterogeneity represented models :10.1.1.48.8190
tailored data model approach automatic classi cation highly independent particular type system easily adapted object oriented data models type systems supporting union types
