world gets networked increasing amounts information stored ldap directories 
ldap directories considerable flexibility modeling retrieval information network applications notion schema provide enabling consistent coherent representation directory information weak 
propose expressive notion bounding schemas ldap directories illustrate practical utility 
bounding schemas lower bound upper bound specifications content structure ldap directory 
bounding schema specification algorithms efficiently determine ldap directory legal bounding schema ii directory insertions deletions preserve legality 
contributions propose rich useful notion schema called bounding schemas restricts legal directory instances sacrificing flexibility offered ldap model section 
key idea specify lower bounds upper bounds content schema attributes object classes expect entity type ii structure schema hierarchical relationships expect entity types represented directory 
algorithms efficiently determine ldap directory legal satisfies bounding schema section ii directory updates preserve legality section

testing legality directory instances principal reason specifying directory schema ensure consistent coherent representation information directory 
guaranteed testing legality instances 
content schema testing directory instance legal respect content schema attribute class schemas performed directory entry independently 
essentially test involves verifying directory entry contains required object class occurrences attributes contains allowed object class occurrences attributes 
approach drawbacks takes time je je jdj set required structural relationships set forbidden structural relationships
