modeling multidimensional databases rakesh agrawal ashish gupta sunita sarawagi ibm almaden research center harry road san jose ca propose data model algebraic operations provide semantic foundation multidimensional databases 
distinguishing feature proposed model symmetric treatment dimensions measures 
model provides support multiple hierarchies dimension support adhoc aggregates 
proposed operators composable closed application 
operators minimal sense expressed terms dropped sacrificing functionality 
possible declarative specification optimization multidimensional database queries currently specified operationally 
response multidimensional database products appeared market see rad survey 
database research community far played major role market phenomenon
