exist end product chains merely tobuy consume producers create companies sole entities involving product development however multiple research studies suchas haveshown innovation paradigm longer true consumers actually source innovation re ected todays products market space recently increasing numberof compa nies altered product innovation paradigms making consumers center product development rather seeing consumers market innovative users shown able identify needs beyond products market space can satisfy needs often converted potential product development ideas incorporated future products example m assembled team lead users included veterinarian surgeon makeup artist doctors developing countries military medics recruited lead users brain stormed ideas two halfdayworkshop asa successful result m initiated product lines e economy skin doctor armor lines shown yield eight time pro table using tradi tional product development method however drawback consumer innovator
