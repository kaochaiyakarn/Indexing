extensible scalable content adaptation pipeline architecture support heterogeneous clients importance middleware content adaptation previously demonstrated pervasive web applications 
propose modular extensible scalable middleware component called content adaptation pipeline performs content adaptation arbitrarily complex data types limited text graphic images 
furthermore architecture part client server applications just web browsers 
leverage xml language uniform means describe elements architecture including client device user profiles data characteristics transcoding operations performed data resultant adapted data 
illustrate flexibility architecture support new data types adaptation operations showing data real world medical application extending capabilities handle animated graphics real time streaming rtp data 
demonstrate scalability architecture executing content adaptation pipeline distributed set servers running efficient protocol
