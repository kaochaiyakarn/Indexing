department computer science university illinois urbana champaign urbana il usa presents general learning approach identifying syntactic patterns snow learning architecture roth roth 
snow learning architecture sparse network linear functions predefined incrementally learned feature space 
computational paradigm suggests snow predictor building block learns perform required predictions writing simple program activates predictors appropriate input aggregates output controls interaction predictors 
instantiations paradigm studied evaluated different shallow parsing tasks identifying base nps sv phrases 
instantiation paradigm uses predictors decide word belongs phrase groups words phrases 
second instantiation finds borders phrases pairs optimal way different phrases 
problems formulations similar studied ramshaw marcus church respectively :10.1.1.79.5346
experimental results snow approach compare favorably previously published results nps sv phrases 
important experiments shed light issues involved learned predictors interact produce desired inference 
particular exhibit contribution chaining features generated output predictors contribute performance predictor uses input 
comparison instantiations learning paradigm inside outside open close shows advantages open close model inside outside especially task identifying long sequences 
evaluation time sentence represented sequence pos tags need evaluate predictor generate inside outside representation sentence generate new features feed second predictor 
open close predictors predictors case decide word phrase phrase 
way phrase boundaries determined annotated placing open bracket word close bracket word phrase
