fast subsequence matching time series databases efficient indexing method locate subsequences collection sequences subsequences match query pattern specified tolerance 
idea map data sequence small set multidimensional rectangles feature space 
rectangles readily indexed traditional spatial access methods tree 
sliding window data sequence extract features result trail feature space 
propose efficient effective algorithm divide trails sub trails subsequently represented minimum bounding rectangles mbrs 
examine queries varying lengths show handle case efficiently
