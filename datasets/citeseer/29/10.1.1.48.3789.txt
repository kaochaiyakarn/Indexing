behaviour agent consists essentially executing different operations depending messages receives internal state receiving message leads agent change state dispatch messages agents 
communication 
model agent may communication channel agent chosen topology communication assume message reach receiver maximum fixed time 
channel isn order messages message sent may received 
messages written language subset kqml language widely agents community allows content message independent message ll see useful feature develop applications involving integration multi language environments :10.1.1.125.3310
communication primitives agent send receive exchanging messages asynchronous send primitive blocking receive blocks execution agent message input channel 
system handles send receive way ensures atomicity managing message sends spread definition agent behaviour related receiving particular message system records performs action avoiding interruptions agent running 
updating 
receiving message usually updates agent knowledge base adding removing information leading agent new state primitive update list updates argument provided language
