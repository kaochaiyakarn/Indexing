repo general purpose object oriented library developing distributed interactive graphics applications range heterogeneous workstations 
repo designed easy programmers rapidly build prototypes familiar multi threaded object oriented programming paradigm 
data sharing graphical non graphical data done general purpose remote replicated objects presenting illusion single distributed shared memory 
graphical objects directly distributed duplicate database problem allowing programmers focus application details 
repo embedded repo interpreted lexically scoped distributed programming language allowing entire applications rapidly prototyped 
discuss repo design introduce notion local variations graphical objects allow local changes applied shared graphical structures

definition 
excellent high level programming libraries available building stand applications inventor performer java similarly powerful general libraries building distributed graphics applications 
cscw systems familiar approach mechanism provided distributing application state custom solution general purpose distributed programming environment isis obliq state graphical display maintained separately local graphics library :10.1.1.17.6050
keeping dual databases synchronized complex tedious error prone endeavor 
contrast non distributed libraries inventor allow programmers avoid problem graphical scene description encode application state 
extending single database model distributed graphics library goal repo 
repo object oriented high level graphics package derived obliq 
particular modula retains strong type safety adding facilities exception handling concurrency object oriented programming automatic garbage collection important features gives uniform access facilities architectures 
repo relies number modula libraries illustrated 
distributed data sharing provided packages network object client server object package replicated object shared object package see section 
derived anim powerful general purpose library originally designed algorithm animation see section 
repo direct descendant obliq uses replicated object package add replicated data obliq see section :10.1.1.17.6050
distributed shared memory native graphics repo data sharing mechanism shared data object model distributed shared memory dsm 
dsm allows network computers programmed multiprocessor programmer familiar paradigm common shared memory 
shared data object model dsm particularly suited needs high level approach implemented efficiently application level 
model shared data encapsulated user defined objects accessed objects method calls 
handler delegate event children may handle changing graphical scene way 
direct descendant anim 
addition objects distributed additional facilities needed general purpose graphical applications texture mapping indexed line polygon sets choice groups projection transformation callbacks picking 
embedded repo obliq see section resulting library called repo 
obliq repo obliq lexically scoped untyped interpreted language distributed object oriented computation :10.1.1.17.6050
implemented tightly integrated modula 
obliq computation may involve multiple threads control address space multiple address spaces machine heterogeneous machines local network multiple networks internet 
obliq uses supports modula thread exception garbage collection facilities
