bayesian representations learning mechanisms content image retrieval andrew lippman mit media laboratory ames st cambridge ma previously introduced bayesian framework content image retrieval cbir relies generative model feature representation embedded mixtures 
truly generic image representation jointly model color texture shown perform broad spectrum image databases 
expand bayesian framework directions 
show formulation cbir problem bayesian inference leads natural criteria evaluating local image similarity requiring image segmentation 
allows practical implementation retrieval systems users provide image regions objects queries 
region queries significantly ambiguous queries entire images leading significant improvements retrieval precision
