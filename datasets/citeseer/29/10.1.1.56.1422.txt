novel server selection technique improving response time replicated service ellen networking telecommunications group college computing georgia institute technology atlanta ga cc gatech edu server replication approach improve ability service handle large number clients 
important factors efficient utilization replicated servers ability direct client requests best server optimality criteria 
target environment servers distributed internet clients identify servers application layer anycasting service 
goal allocate servers clients way minimizes client response time 
develop approach estimating performance client experience accessing particular servers 
information maintained resolver clients query obtain identity server best response time
