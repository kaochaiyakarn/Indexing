blobworld system region image indexing retrieval carson thomas serge belongie joseph hellerstein malik eecs department university california berkeley ca usa eecs berkeley edu 
blobworld system image retrieval finding coherent image regions roughly correspond objects 
image automatically segmented regions blobs associated color texture descriptors 
querying attributes regions interest description entire image 
order large scale retrieval feasible index blob descriptions tree 
indexing high dimensional feature space computationally prohibitive lower rank approximation high dimensional distance 
key reason poor quality query results systems look meaningful image regions corresponding objects 
additionally results difficult understand system acts black box 
consequently process refining query may frustrating 
individual query results unpredictable difficult produce stream queries satisfies user need 
earlier described blobworld new framework image retrieval segmenting image regions blobs generally correspond objects parts objects :10.1.1.118.4395
segmentation algorithm fully automatic parameter tuning hand pruning regions 
complete online system retrieval collection corel images approach 
query system available cs berkeley edu photos blobworld 
results indicating querying distinctive objects blobworld produces higher precision querying color texture histograms entire image
