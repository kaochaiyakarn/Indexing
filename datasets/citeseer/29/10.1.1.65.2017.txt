hypursuit hierarchical network search engine exploits content link hypertext clustering ron weiss velez mark sheldon peter duda david gi ord programming systems research group mit laboratory computer science technology square cambridge ma usa tel mail lcs mit edu hypursuit new hierarchical network search engine clusters hypertext documents structure information space browsing search activities 
content link clustering algorithm semantic information embedded hyperlink structures document contents 
hypursuit admits multiple coexisting cluster hierarchies di erent principles grouping documents library congress catalog scheme automatically created hypertext clusters 
hypursuit abstraction functions summarize cluster contents support scalable query processing 
abstraction functions satisfy system resource limitations controlled information loss 
result query processing operations cluster summary approximates result performing operations entire information space 
systems ad hoc static requiring manual update maintenance 
yahoo classi es documents manually supports content access collection documents gathered users submissions web robots 
document clustering previously studied mechanism improve searching browsing 
salton presents summary document clustering techniques improve collection searching 
scatter gather dynamically clusters collections documents browsing large information spaces :10.1.1.34.6746
presents summaries clusters user select subset clusters reclustering 
selected clusters scattered original documents re clustered 
new clusters reveal contents detail total number re clustered documents reduced 
scatter gather hypursuit de nes framework information retrieval services query routing re nement hierarchy servers 
cluster summary includes parts heavily weighted terms cluster summary sub clusters computed abstraction function query re nement 
summary sub cluster includes selection heavily weighted terms list documents sub cluster 
current implementation hypursuit arbitrarily selects sample list documents 
implementation select documents representative sub cluster 
example system suggest precomputed centroid documents sub cluster terms sub cluster link structures :10.1.1.34.6746
result set expansion improve recall hypursuit suggests additional related documents selected query collocated query selected documents
