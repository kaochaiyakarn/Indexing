compression inverted indexes fast query evaluation williams john justin zobel school computer science information technology rmit university box melbourne australia 
compression reduces size indexes time needed evaluate queries 
revisit compression inverted lists document postings store position frequency indexed terms considering approaches improving retrieval efficiency better implementation better choice integer compression schemes 
propose simple optimisations known integer compression schemes show experimentally lead significant reductions time 
second explore impact choice compression scheme retrieval efficiency 
experiments large collections data show surprising results simple byte aligned codes halves query evaluation time compared compact golomb rice bitwise compression schemes index fits entirely memory byte aligned codes result faster query evaluation uncompressed index cost transferring data memory cpu cache appropriately compressed index uncompressed index
