web caches employed store web view provide immediate response recurring queries 
accuracy replicates web caches encounters challenges due dynamicity web data 
developing evaluating web caching system equipped efficient refresh strategy 
assistance novel index structure aggregation path index apix built argos web cache system gmd xql query engine 
argos achieves high degree self maintenance diagnosing irrelevant data update cases greatly improves refresh performance materialized web view 
example bid site allows users post queries watch list goods interest 
certain period users expect notified changes view results watch list 
efficiency notification effect customers business decisions critical 
observed updates affect cached view results 
research efforts study utilizing auxiliary information initial view computation phase :10.1.1.32.7045
direction developed materialized web view cache system efficient refresh capability employing novel index structure 
utilized discover self maintenance cases eliminate unnecessary accesses base web sources 
describe web cache system called argos adopts novel refresh technique 
argos query capability xql query language full implementation 
describe apix structure maintenance algorithms detail 

argos maintenance strategy data update naive algorithm simply refreshes web view re computing scratch 
costly initial web view computation xml sources may involve processing queries 
materialized web view view site research striving provide efficient maintenance strategy minimize refresh delay web view :10.1.1.32.7045
incremental view maintenance approach proposed abiteboul utilizes auxiliary index structure called view site stores objects relevant query 
example xql query publisher book author publisher book author elements xml sources kept index 
update happens author element au maintenance approach needs query process publisher book elements proceeds author element type binds au 
approach object kept index long bound query variable
