roles social relationships provide abstraction develop notion social mental shaping 
allows extend standard belief desire intention model account common social phenomena cooperation collaborative problem solving negotiation integrated unified theoretical perspective reflects fully model autonomous agent mental state 
example trying new beliefs goals perform new individual inter agent activity abandon modify existing activity 
short existence influence process lies heart sociality agent systems 
behaviour agent entirely determined internal drivers interplay physical environment seen percepts behaviour social agent additionally influenced social interactions engaged 
process influencing represents essence social interaction received surprisingly little attention date

providing clear conceptual model social nature agents impacts individual decision making behaviour extends state art important ways 
firstly identifies fundamental structures mechanisms underpin wide variety social interactions multi agent systems 
shown notion social mental shaping characterise common forms inter agent interaction cooperation collaborative problem solving negotiation 
identifying common ground provides unifying framework expressing analysing disparate formal models social agency taken place date

social attitudes capture interactions agents reflect agent mental attitude commitment agent performing action type 
social commitments social attitudes capture aspects relationships agents teams suffer number shortcomings 
firstly social nature agents impact individual mental states form commitment agents performing actions 
example agent may adopt mental attitude kraus parsons :10.1.1.36.2807:10.1.1.36.2807:10.1.1.36.3441:10.1.1.36.3441
persuasion clearly grounded form social interaction necessitate commitment agents involved 
agent may change mental state merely basis confidence agent 
secondly concept says agent mental state may influenced takes role multi agent system outside particular social relationship agent 
sociality basic forms reflected actual interactions agents potential ones 
example assumption benevolence early distributed problem solving systems erman lesser

furthermore agent may adopt agent mental attitude process bargaining negotiation handy buchanan

mental attitudes return desired behaviour 
threat 
agent may threatened adopt mental attitude basis negative interference denied help kraus sierra :10.1.1.36.3441:10.1.1.36.3441
case agent may influenced adopt mental attitude threatens execute action conflict desires goals intentions 
second case agent influenced threat act help fulfil desires goals intentions
