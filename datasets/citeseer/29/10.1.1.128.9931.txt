broadcast primitives replicated databases stanoi agrawal el abbadi dept computer science university california santa barbara ca mail agrawal cs ucsb edu explore di erent variants broadcast protocols managing replicated databases 
starting simplest broadcast primitive reliable broadcast protocol show ensure correct transaction execution 
protocol simple advantages including prevention deadlocks 
requires commitment protocol ensuring correctness 
develop second protocol uses causal broadcast avoids overhead phase commit exploiting causal delivery properties broadcast primitives implicitly collect relevant information phase commit 
protocol employs atomic broadcast completely eliminates need transaction commitment 
causally related messages delivered order sites atomic broadcast protocol ensures messages delivered order sites 
various implementations protocols proposed di erent underlying hardware including amoeba isis total totem 
general weaker ordering requirements cient protocol 
important cited application broadcast protocols management replicated data 
increasing interest management replicated databases unit activity transaction consisting multiple operations need executed atomically unit :10.1.1.164.3636
proposals explore transaction semantics cases replication management protocols require addition broadcast primitives additional techniques ensure correct transaction execution 
furthermore atomic broadcast primitives expensive complex implement asynchronous systems subject failures 
raynal proposed protocols broadcast primitives relax serializability correctness criterion 
explore variants broadcast protocols managing replicated databases serializability 
commit rule 
site decides commit transaction broadcasts commit request releases read locks held includes read set delivery site checks marked abortion pending write operations read set non empty intersection write sets local transactions 
case aborted locally toc broadcasted 
receiving sites messages causally dependent receiving negative acknowledgment read transactions broadcast commit decisions aborted protocol 
detailed proof correctness requires case analysis di erent con ict cases pair transactions :10.1.1.128.9931
causal broadcast protocol implicit positive acknowledgment appropriate situations sites broadcast messages fairly frequently wait implicit acknowledgments drawback resulting substantial delays transaction commitment 
protocol explicit acknowledgment circumvent problem number messages involved commit phase transaction proportional square number sites 
protocol commit decisions eliminates need acknowledgments 
preceding protocols read operations executed locally order maintain low number messages broadcasted sites 
receipt sites notice obsolete imply transaction order con icts consistently decide abort 
case sites may re ect di erent con icts delivery concurrent writes 
previous protocol case easily detected vector clocks inconsistencies avoided 
transaction involved con ict commit request delivered rst executed con icting transactions aborted 
details algorithm provided :10.1.1.128.9931
atomic broadcast commit operations eliminates need negative acknowledgments necessary inform transactions involved con icting concurrent write operations read write con icts 
operations resolved relying total order enforced atomic broadcast
