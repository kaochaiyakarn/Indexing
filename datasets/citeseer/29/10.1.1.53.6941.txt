information systems deriving incremental production rules deductive data stefano ceri jennifer widom dipartimento di informazione department computer science politecnico di milano stanford university leonardo da vinci stanford ca milano italy usa ceri widom cs stanford edu show production rule mechanism provided active database systems quickly easily implement logic rule interface deductive database systems 
deductive rules specify derived relations datalog built predicates stratified negation deductive rules compiled automatically production rules 
materialized approach derived relations stored database production rules automatically incrementally propagate base relation changes derived relations 
non materialized approach production rules compute derived relations demand 
considerable amount research focused adding rules database systems 
divisible areas deductive database systems active database systems
