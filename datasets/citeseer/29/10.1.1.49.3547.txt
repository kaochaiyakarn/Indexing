architecture wide area distributed system philip van steen andrew tanenbaum steen cs vu nl distributed systems provide sharing resources information computer network 
key design issue systems attractive aspects related distribution transparent users 
unfortunately general purpose wide area distributed systems allow users share manage arbitrary resources transparent way hardly exist 
particular generally take account important properties characterize wide area systems large number users resources inherent latency problem caused distance nodes heterogeneity due variety underlying operating systems networks involvement multiple administrative organizations 
research described part globe project globe stands global object environment goal project design implementation wide area distributed system provides convenient programming abstraction full transparency 
main contribution description new system distributed shared objects
