care elderly ill people major challenges currently faced society 
needs range increasing articulation assisting dementia cognitive impairment 
respond challenge developed prototype robot 
natural language robot provide information related activities daily living obtained web 
enables remote care establish tele presence people home relaying back video audio stream generation internet 
describes early prototype lays research agenda building service robots elderly 
problem turn millennium number elderly need care increasing dramatically 
today population years age 
generation approaches retirement age number increase significantly 
population 
information summarized bureau census population people older expected increase percent year percent years 
current living conditions majority elderly people unsatisfactory situation worsen 
department health human services nearly percent non institutionalized persons years age unable perform activities daily living dressing toilet getting bed chairs 
time nation facing explosion costs health care sector 
current nursing home costs range annually 
decade costs doubled adjusted dollars 
dramatic increase elderly population explosion costs pose extreme challenges society 
current practices providing care elderly population insufficient 
undoubtedly problem multiply decade 
society need find alternative ways providing care elderly ill population 
ways lower costs 
increase comfort living approach people level elderly deserve 
robotic technology time going major revolutions 
sparked dramatic increase computation dollar substantial decreases costs major sensor technologies cameras closer goal intelligent service robots assist people daily living activities 
years service robots successfully fielded hospitals king museums burgard office buildings department stores endres perform services deliver educate entertain 
robots bee developed guiding blind people dawson howe 
time ripe leverage technology lives elderly people need personal assistance larger age group 
described initial results obtained cmu project goal project development personal robotic aids serves primary functions cognitive prosthesis 
large fraction elderly population suffers varying degrees dementia 
inability remember severe consequences 
example subjects may forget take medicine forget see bathroom conditions severe patients need regular supervision carrying daily activities means moving nursing home 
people robot lesser purposes finding tv 
reminding important time consuming activity healthcare professional life 
safeguarding 
elderly people physically cognitively impaired private home pose substantial risks 
example accidents relating falling undetected severe consequences patient death 
loss stability leading problem independently living elderly people 
reducing risks systematic monitoring safeguarding move dependent living nursing home delayed 
systematic data collection 
key problem currently faced health care sector inability collect data people living private homes 
data include statistics medication person take daily living activities factors related prediction specific medical risks blood sugar leg diameter 
assuming necessary mechanisms place guarantee privacy information data tremendous value professional care diagnosis selection fo treatment 
remote tele medicine 
home visits healthcare professionals doctors extremely rare due high costs involved 
idea robotic telepresence internet technology relay live video audio stream doctor office patient living room enabling doctor establish tele presence patient home 
ability move manipulate provides enhanced degree flexibility currently lacking video conferencing competing alternatives 
social interaction 
vast majority independently living elderly people forced live deprived social interaction 
social engagement significantly delay deterioration health related problems 
robots replace humans seek understand degree robots augment humans directly interacting person providing communication interface different people usable current alternatives 
accommodate needs currently developing generation personal service robot specifically targeted people mild forms dementia physical low blood pressure
