generic approach bulk loading multidimensional index structures jochen van den increasing interest supporting bulk operations multidimensional index structures 
bulk loading refers process creating initial index structure presumably large data set 
generic algorithm bulk loading applicable broad class index structures 
approach differs completely previous ones reasons 
sorting multidimensional data predefined global ordering completely avoided 
approach standard routines splitting merging pages fully implemented corresponding index structure
