grams gram character slice longer string 
literature term include notion occurring set characters string gram third character word term contiguous slices 
typically slices string set overlapping grams 
system grams different lengths simultaneously 
append blanks string order help matching word word situations

text categorization gram frequency statistics human languages invariably words occur frequently 
common ways expressing idea known zipf law re state follows nth common word human language text occurs frequency inversely proportional implication law set words dominates words language terms frequency 
true words general words specific particular subject 
furthermore smooth continuum dominance frequent 
smooth nature frequency curves helps ways implies worry specific frequency thresholds 
law holds 
gram frequencies rank technical document approximately aspects human languages 
particular true frequency occurrence grams inflection forms morpheme word components carry meaning 
see example zipfian distribution gram frequencies technical document 
zipf law implies classifying documents gram frequency statistics sensitive cutting distributions particular rank 
implies comparing documents category similar gram frequency distributions 
built experimental text categorization system uses idea 
illustrates data flow system 
scheme start set pre existing text categories subject domains reasonably sized samples say bytes 
generate set gram frequency profiles represent categories 
new document arrives classification system computes gram frequency profile 
compares profile profiles categories easily calculated distance measure 
system classifies document belonging category having smallest distance 
generating gram frequency profiles bubble labelled generate profile simple 
merely reads incoming text counts occurrences grams 
system performs steps split text separate tokens consisting letters 
digits punctuation discarded 
pad token sufficient blanks 
scan token generating possible grams 
positions span padding blanks 
hash table find counter gram increment 
hash table uses conventional collision handling mechanism ensure gram gets counter 
done output grams counts 
sort counts reverse order number occurrences 
keep just grams reverse order frequency 

dataflow gram text categorization category samples new document generate profile generate profile category profiles document profile measure profile distance profile distances find minimum distance selected category resulting file gram frequency profile document 
plot frequencies profile rank get zipfian distribution graph similar 
informal observations inspection number different gram frequency profiles variety different category samples top grams highly correlated language 
long english passage compilers long english passage poetry tend great grams common top entries respective profiles 
hand long passage french topic different distribution grams 
highest ranking grams uni grams simply reflect distribution letters alphabet document language 
come grams comprise function words determiners frequent prefixes suffixes 
course long tail distribution language specific grams goes past 
starting rank gram frequency profile begins show grams specific subject document 
represent terms stems occur frequently documents subject 
special rank zipf law gives fact smooth distribution curve 
arrived number inspection 
doubtless elaborate statistics choose optimal cutoff rank particular application 
note observations apply shorter documents newsgroups 
documents longer shift language specific grams subject specific grams occur rank 
comparing ranking gram frequency profiles bubble labelled measure profile distance simple 
merely takes gram profiles calculates simple rank order statistic call place measure 
measure determines far place gram profile place profile 
gives simple example calculation grams 
gram document profile find counterpart category profile calculate far place example gram ing rank document rank category 
ranks place 
gram ed category profile takes maximum place value 
sum place values grams distance measure document category 
kinds statistical measures ranked lists rank sum test 
place score provides simple intuitive distance measure proof concept tests 
bubble labelled find minimum distance simply takes distance measures category profiles document profile picks smallest 
testing gram text categorization language classification writing systems support language 
example nearly languages soviet union script 
text uses particular writing system necessary determine language written processing possible 
broad approaches language classification problem 
obvious technique keep lexicon possible language look word sample text see lexicon falls 
lexicon contains words sample indicates language 
building obtaining representative lexicons necessarily easy especially lesser languages 
furthermore language highly inflected different forms word indicate case tense attributes lexicons times larger get necessary word inclusion develop language specific morphological processing reduce different forms stems 
text result ocr process may recognition errors due poor image quality disrupt lexicon lookup process 
approach language classification involves gram analysis 
basic idea identify grams occurrence document gives strong evidence identification text belonging particular language 
done test case text categorization method 
gram frequency profile technique classify documents language building lexicon set morphological processing rules 
need merely obtain modestly sized sample texts bytes calculate gram frequency profiles classify documents
