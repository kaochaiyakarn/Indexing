generating production rules decision trees inductive knowledge acquisition algorithms generate classifiers form decision trees 
describes technique transforming trees small sets production rules common formalism expressing knowledge expert systems 
method training set cases decision tree generated generalize assess reliability individual rules extracted tree subsequently refine collection rules 
final set production rules usually simpler decision tree obtained accurate classifying unseen cases 
transformation production rules provides way combining different decision trees classification domain 
decision tree simple recursive structure expressing sequential classification process case described set attributes assigned disjoint set classes
