search operations databases require special support physical level 
true conventional databases spatial databases typical search operations include point query find objects contain search point region query find objects overlap search region 
years spatial database research resulted great variety multidimensional access methods support operations 
give overview 
brief survey spatial data management general class point access methods search sets points dimensions 
insertions deletions interleaved updates data structures context support dynamic behavior time 
third spatial databases tend large 
geographic maps example typically occupy gigabytes storage 
integration secondary tertiary memory essential efficient processing chen 
fourth standard algebra defined spatial data proposals past egenhofer ting scholl ting schneider :10.1.1.52.4815
means particular standardized set base operators 
set operators depends heavily application domain operators intersection common 
fifth spatial operators closed 
intersection polygons example may return number single points dangling edges disjoint polygons 
contribute substantially minimizing number disk accesses range query
