computers seeing action aaron bobick mit media laboratory ames street cambridge ma usa bobick media mit edu www media mit edu bobick research computer vision shifted processing single static images manipulation video sequences concept action recognition important 
fundamental understanding action reasoning time implicit explicit framework 
describe specific examples incorporating time representations action representations recognize actions 
approaches differ variation time considered continuous mapping state trajectory qualitative semantically labeled sequence 
domains body actions hand gestures described approaches detail constrained semantic domains watching cooking labeling dynamic events american football briefly mentioned 
seeing action understanding video sequences different conventional image understanding interested happening scene opposed scene 
number approaches appeared attempting full dimensional reconstruction human form image sequences presumption information useful necessary understand action place 
consider extremely blurred sequence action frames example shown 
structure frame people trivially recognize action sitting 
capabilities argue recognizing action motion opposed reconstructing dimensional model person recognizing action model 
prior area addressed periodic gross motion detection recognition understanding facial expressions :10.1.1.27.7641
propose representation recognition theory decomposes motion recognition describing motion spatial pattern describing motion moving :10.1.1.44.8622
basic idea project temporal pattern motion single image representation temporal template 
approach natural extension black yacoob facial expression recognition
