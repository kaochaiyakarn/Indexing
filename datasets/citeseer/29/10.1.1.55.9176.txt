html formatting aid natural language processing world wide web dan dipasquo senior honors thesis june school computer science carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa magnitude fact computer understandable world wide web prime candidate automatic natural language tasks 
thesis argues information layout web page looking html formatting addition text page improve performance tasks learning classify segments documents 
rich representation web pages html struct tree described 
parsing algorithm creating struct trees set experiments struct trees feature set learning extract name location web pages 
experiments useful consider layout page tasks

web may currently live definition true pages incredible rate growth quickly moving direction 
unfortunately nature web embodiment human knowledge accessing information difficult task ordering index web pages 
currently find interesting information web rely keyword search lycos altavista small percentage web indexed hand yahoo 
options ineffective means accessing information available web continues grow problem 
reasons web prime candidate systems attempt automatically catalog information ontology automatically extract knowledge highly regular semi regular sources agents actively search web :10.1.1.35.6633
traditional natural language processing techniques immediately applicable web problems arise applying algorithm designed flat text processing web pages 
techniques expect complete formed sentences web norm short informative sentence fragments 
information conveyed visual cues lists tables hyperlinks 
example people members group expressed heading members followed list members names 
traditional information extraction task defined message understanding community muc document automatically find essential details text newswire article terrorist attack find names attacking group victims attack 
shown applicable web extracting specific information web page name personal home page 
differs traditional done flat text 
early techniques relied hand crafted algorithms extracting information 
research focussed machine learning information extraction tasks shown promise information extraction web :10.1.1.32.8501
attempts extract information web primarily flavors extraction highly regular sources readable text automatically produced database generalization machine learning techniques handle unstructured text 
reduced general problem wrapper induction developed 
webfoot attempt general information extraction web 
uses crystal information extraction system takes parsed annotated sentences finds patterns extraction novel sentences 
srv learning architecture information extraction 
takes user defined feature set hand tagged training documents attempts learn rules extraction 
srv web pages feature sets included html information able learn rules extracting web 
text retrieval conferences trec reported document classification 
craven shows document classification useful finding interesting ontology entries web :10.1.1.35.6633
traditional document classification techniques view document bag words order matter 
simple techniques generalize web affected lack traditional syntactic structure 
web techniques improved advantage sources information
