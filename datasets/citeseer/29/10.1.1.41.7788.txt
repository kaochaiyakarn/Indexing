maintenance data cubes summary tables warehouse inderpal singh mumick laboratories mumick research att com dallan quass stanford university quass cs stanford edu singh mumick lucent technologies lucent com data warehouses contain large amounts information collected variety independent sources 
functions warehouse line analytical processing olap involve hundreds complex aggregate queries large volumes data 
feasible compute queries scanning data sets time 
warehouse applications build large number summary tables materialized aggregate views help increase system performance 
changes notably new transactional data collected data sources summary tables warehouse depend data need updated 
usually source changes loaded warehouse regular intervals usually day batch window warehouse unavailable querying updated 
data warehouses designed line analytical processing olap queries aggregate large volumes data performed new jersey institute technology 
order detect trends anomalies 
order speed query processing environments warehouses usually contain large number summary tables represent materialized aggregate views base data collected sources 
summary tables group base data various dimensions corresponding different sets group attributes compute various aggregate functions called measures 
example cube operator gblp define summary tables statement :10.1.1.120.4505
changes data sources warehouse views updated reflect changed state data sources 
views recomputed scratch incremental maintenance techniques bc si rk blt han sp qw qua cw gms gl lmss calculate changes views due source changes 
common data warehousing environment source changes deferred applied warehouse views large batches efficiency 
source changes received day applied views batch window time warehouse unavailable readers 
note names views chosen reflect group attributes 
character represents storeid represents itemid represents date 
create view sid sales storeid itemid date select storeid itemid date count sum qty pos group storeid itemid date create view scd sales city date select city date count sum qty pos stores pos storeid stores storeid group city date create view sic sales storeid category select storeid category count min date sum qty pos items pos itemid items itemid group storeid category create view sr sales region select region count sum qty pos stores pos storeid stores storeid group region example summary tables notation sc represents city store sr represents region store ic represents category item 
example name sic sales implies storeid category group attributes view definition 
views represent possible points data cube described gblp date dimension measure :10.1.1.120.4505
difference previous data cubes previous data aggregated comes solely fact table dimension hierarchy information obtained implicitly 
mentioned earlier data warehouses typically store dimension hierarchy information explicitly dimension tables extend data cube concept include explicit joins dimension tables see section 
sales changes representing new sale data come warehouse 
mentioned section warehouses apply changes immediately 
refresh functions corresponding tables section 
general follow straightforward fashion example refresh function sid sales section exception min aggregate function sic sales 
section show refresh function handles min max aggregate functions 
background notation section review concepts self maintainable aggregate functions section data cube section computation lattice corresponding data cube section 
self maintainable aggregate functions gblp aggregate functions divided classes distributive algebraic holistic :10.1.1.120.4505
distributive aggregate functions computed partitioning input disjoint sets aggregating set individually aggregating partial results set final result 
aggregate functions standard sql count sum min max distributive 
example count computed summing partial counts 
note distinct keyword count distinct count distinct values functions longer distributive 
instance tuple having minimum maximum value deleted new minimum maximum value group recomputed changes base data 
including count help little count reaches tuple group group deleted count min max self maintainable 
count tuple having minimum maximum value deleted need look base table 
count help maintaining min max count count min null count min max self maintainable count count tuple having minimum maximum value deleted need look base table 
data cube date cube gblp convenient way thinking multiple aggregate views derived fact table different sets group attributes :10.1.1.120.4505
data cubes popular olap provide intuitive way data analysts navigate various levels summary information database 
data cube attributes categorized dimension attributes grouping may performed measures results aggregate functions 
cube views data cube dimension attributes shorthand cube views defined single select groupby block having identical aggregation functions identical clauses having clause subsets dimension attributes groupby columns 
example example data cube pos table section shown lattice structure 
worth noting previous papers consider problem maintaining multiple aggregate views efficient summary delta table method 
formal split maintenance process propagate refresh functions proposed cgl 
build propagate refresh idea extending aggregate views complex refresh functions 
notion self maintainable aggregation functions extension self maintainability select project join views defined gjm 
gblp proposed cube operator linking related aggregate tables sql query started mini industry warehousing research :10.1.1.120.4505
notion cube lattices dimension lattices proposed hru algorithm determine subset cube views materialized maximize querying benefit space constraint 
algorithms efficiently materialize subset cube lattice proposed sag 
need technique maintain cube views efficiently provides summary delta table method
