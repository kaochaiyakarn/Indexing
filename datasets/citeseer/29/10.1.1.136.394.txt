information technology arti cial intelligence particular play central role endeavor explorers form computational intelligence call remote agents 
describe remote agent speci autonomous agent architecture principles model programming board deduction search goal directed closed loop commanding takes signi enabling 
architecture addresses unique characteristics spacecraft domain require highly reliable autonomous operations long periods time tight deadlines resource constraints concurrent activity tightly coupled subsystems 
technical features livingstone particularly worth highlighting 
long held vision model reasoning single central model support diversity engineering tasks 
noted livingstone automates variety tasks single model single core algorithm making signi cant progress achieving model vision 
second livingstone representation formalism achieves broad coverage hybrid discrete continuous software hardware systems coupling concurrent transition system models underlying concurrent reactive languages qualitative representations developed model reasoning 
third approach uni es dichotomy ai deduction reactivity con search algorithm coupled fast propositional reasoning :10.1.1.12.1680
discuss points detail 
representation formalism implemented model diagnosis systems traditionally specify behavior modeling example see 
formalism system models built individual component models speci cation connections components 
component model consists set modes corresponding di erent nominal failure modes component 
essential providing rapid timely response 
discuss point detail shortly 
essential lesson draw experience extremely simple qualitative models appropriate practical signi cant tasks 
reactivity deduction akey contribution livingstone fact uni es dichotomy ai deduction reactivity 
authors principally argued symbolic reasoning methods planning deduction search unable bridge gap perception action timely fashion :10.1.1.12.1680
example discussing construction reactive systems rapidly handle complexity uncertainty real situations agre chapman claim proving theorems question 

argument goes right way construct reactive systems compile inference network combinational circuits possibly augmented timers state elements leading example subsumption architecture 
solution adequate types reactive systems particularly remote agents
