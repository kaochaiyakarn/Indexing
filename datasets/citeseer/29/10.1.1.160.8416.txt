working hypotheses inspired earlier research propose fundamental working hypotheses function starting points postulates try build general model distributed cognition 

groups agents self organize consider group initially autonomous actors agents agent human animal social artificial 
agents definition perform actions 
shared environment action general affect 
agents proximity interact meaning changes state causally affect changes state 
causal dependencies imply agents collectively form dynamical system evolving impulse individual actions indirect effects propagated agents changes environment 
system typically non linear causal influences normally propagate cycles forming complex feedback loops 
dynamical system computational structure principle able process information generate patterns crutchfield 
complex system inherently difficult model control predict dynamical systems tend self organize ashby heylighen heylighen heylighen gershenson evolve relatively stable configuration states attractor dynamics 
say agents configuration mutually adapted ashby limiting interactions allow collective configuration endure 
going selective pressure interactions synergetic wright heylighen mutually beneficial interaction preferable 
view self organization evolution collective configuration effectively creates form social organization agents support activities maximize collective benefit 
configuration viewed mediator coordinating agents actions heylighen 
illustrated simulations evolution cooperation axelrod riolo cohen axelrod edmonds allows overcome obstacles individual selfishness free riding exemplified prisoners dilemma axelrod heylighen heylighen campbell coordination theory crowston distinguish fundamental dependencies activities processes organization processes resource input contribute task goal output process prerequisite process output input second 
case calls tasks performed parallel second case sequence 
efficient organization means right activities delegated right agents right time 
parallel distribution tasks determines division labor agents 
sequential distribution determines workflow 
division labor reinforces specialization agents allowing develop expertise gaines martens 
enables collective overcome individual cognitive limitations accumulating larger amount knowledge single agent 
workflow allows information propagated processed sequentially refined stage process 
self organization potentially produces emergent cognitive capabilities exist individual level 

organization opts external media information sharing self organization sense seen efficient synergetic interactions 
interactions agents necessarily pass shared physical environment 
call external phenomena support interactions media 
certain parts aspects environment lend better synergetic interaction 
example low bandwidth communication channel difficult control smoke signals support synergetic interactions reliable highbandwidth optical cable 
selective pressure agents preferentially efficient media ones causal influences information transmitted accurately reliably 
simply agents change media generally adapting better suit purposes 
example animals people regularly travel irregular terrain different target locations food reserves water holes dwellings activity paths trails terrain facilitate movement 
paths created certain agents attract guide movements agents providing shared coordination mechanism lets agents communicate indirectly 
actions trajectories movement media tracks eroded terrain evolve adapting better fit 
slightly advanced version mechanism trails pheromones laid ants steer members colony available food sources providing colony collective mental map surroundings heylighen 
humans specialized tool builders excel adaptation environment needs especially physical signs symbols electromagnetic waves hardware store transmit process information 
way external media increasingly assimilated opted social organization shaping shaped making organization functioning dependent 
result collective cognitive system extended physical environment longer separated 

distributed cognitive systems function connectionist networks considering extended social organization distributed cognitive system level distinguish nodes agents objects store contain information links media channels information transmitted nodes 
links variable strength strength represents ease frequency intensity information transmitted 
represent stabilized causal influences agents objects possibly supported opted media 
node characterized space possible states 
actual state process propagated parallel different links recombined receiving nodes 
state spaces general factorized independent variables degrees freedom take continuum values heylighen 
complex node functionally decomposed array simple onedimensional nodes take single intensity activation value

systems wholly decentralized self organizing eliminating need central executive processes information 
activation spreads automatically nodes received initial stimuli associated nodes connectionist networks exhibit emergent phenomena pattern completion generalization 
allows fill lacking data infer plausible basis limited information 
importantly connectionist networks inherently support learning means continuous adaptation link strengths ways 
successfully links stronger making easier information propagated links rarely led erroneous results weaken 
extended cognitive system conceive mechanisms selective reinforcement 
physical level commonly media effective proposed previous hypothesis 
flexible mechanism social adaptation agent learns experience communicating agent 
agent reacts appropriately agent increase trust competence communicate similar information agent 
network experience stored long term weight changes connections 
network acquires new knowledge distributed manner storing pattern links states memories individual nodes 
example distributed learning system invisible hand market knows supply match demand allocating resources agents appear competent satisfy demand heylighen

example reinforcement links increase trust builds authority sending agents telling information receiving agents know agree making important transmit detailed explicit reports 
spread activation existing connections automatically attenuate inconsistent van overwalle complex signals amplifying signals confirmed different sources conformity activate built rewards punishments utility 
selective propagation filtering relevant reliable data constitutes information processing compresses data potentially underlying pattern essence 
selectivity inadequate lead loss important ideas propagation incorrect information exemplified flurry social cognitive biases characterizes van van overwalle

noted earlier main ways information spread people parallel serial 
communication strategies adopted experiments 
parallel communication design information propagated communicators directly participant 
experiment easily controlled artificial communicators 
example typical experiment artificial communicators participants read pc screen number behaviors exhibited members target groups different communicators annie saw member group helped old lady street

alternatively information exchange real participants group groups total participants studied control content communication achieved providing relevant background information exchange starts 
exchange new information group needs discussed order achieve consensus reach task goal 
measure extent information shared members open discussion afterward measure influenced members opinions recall 
crucial issue distribution information 
instance information blocked unshared information pertaining group dimension features communicated single communicator dispersed shared information spread equally randomly communicators 
earlier simulation van van overwalle expect different distributions blocked vs dispersed produce substantial differences group perceptions 
types distribution considered presentation information communication see simulation van overwalle

previous simulations van overwalle heylighen heath van van overwalle prior experiments lyons expect general group impressions increasingly stereotypical communicated communicators parallel communication chain 
circumstances may expect opposite occur
