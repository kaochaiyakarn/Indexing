journal artificial intelligence research submitted published flexibly instructable agents scott huffman huffman tc pw com price technology centre road menlo park ca usa john laird laird eecs umich edu artificial intelligence laboratory university michigan ave ann arbor mi usa presents approach learning situated interactive tutorial instruction ongoing agent 
tutorial instruction flexible powerful paradigm teaching tasks allows instructor communicate types knowledge agent need situations arise 
support flexibility agent able learn multiple kinds knowledge broad range instructional interactions 
approach called situated explanation achieves learning combination analytic inductive techniques 
combines form explanation learning situated instruction full suite contextually guided responses incomplete explanations 
approach implemented agent called instructo soar learns hierarchies new tasks domain knowledge interactive natural language instructions 
instructo soar demonstrated instructional learning learning knowledge sources 
instructo soar theory precludes 
learning knowledge sources invoked possibly enhanced instruction 
instance instructor invoke learning observation pointing set objects saying tower similarly instruction containing metaphor invoke analogical learning 
application instruction potentially enhance learning mechanisms personal assistant software agents learn observing users maes mitchell :10.1.1.153.2100
adding ability learn verbal instructions addition observations allow users explicitly train agents situations learning observation may difficult slow 
second instructo soar recover incorrect knowledge leads invalid explanations incorrect external performance 
incorrect knowledge may part agent initial domain theory may learned faulty instruction 
inability recover incorrect knowledge precludes instruction general case exceptions instance grasp red blocks ok grasp ones safety signs
