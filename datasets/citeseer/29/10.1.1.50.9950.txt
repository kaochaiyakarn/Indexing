pivoted document length normalization amit singhal chris buckley mitra department computer science cornell university ithaca ny cs cornell edu automatic information retrieval systems deal documents varying lengths text collection 
document length normalization fairly retrieve documents lengths 
study observe normalization scheme retrieves documents lengths similar chances likelihood relevance outperform scheme retrieves documents chances different likelihood relevance 
show retrieval probabilities particular normalization method deviate systematically relevance probabilities different collections 
pivoted normalization technique modify normalization function reducing gap relevance retrieval probabilities 
training pivoted normalization collection successfully new text collections yielding robust collection independent normalization technique 
point shortcomings cosine function new normalization functions pivoted unique normalization pivoted byte size normalization 
background term weighting important aspect modern text retrieval systems 
terms words phrases indexing units identify contents text 
different terms different importance text importance indicator term weight associated term 
main components affect importance term text term frequency factor tf inverse document frequency factor idf document length normalization :10.1.1.101.9086

document length normalization term weights remove advantage long documents retrieval short documents 
main reasons necessitate normalization term weights 
higher term frequencies long documents usually terms repeatedly 
document length normalization way penalizing term weights document accordance length 
various normalization techniques information retrieval systems 
review commonly normalization techniques ffl cosine normalization cosine normalization commonly normalization technique vector space model 
cosine normalization factor computed raw tf weight term 
cosine normalization attacks reasons normalization higher terms step :10.1.1.101.9086
higher individual term frequencies increase individual values increasing penalty term weights 
document terms number individual weights cosine factor formula increases yielding higher normalization factor 
ffl maximum tf normalization popular normalization technique normalization individual tf weights document maximum tf document
