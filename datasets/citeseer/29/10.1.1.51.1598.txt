semistructured data absolute schema fixed advance structure may irregular incomplete 
data commonly arises sources impose rigid structure world wide web data combined heterogeneous sources 
data models query languages designed structured data inappropriate environments 
starting lightweight object model adopted tsimmis project stanford describe query language object repository designed specifically semistructured data 
language provides meaningful query results cases conventional models languages data absent data regular structure similar concepts represented different types heterogeneous sets object structure fully known 
example treatment range variables generalizes sql approach section 
language developed unifying query language tsimmis project stanford pgmw 
goal tsimmis project provide framework tools integrating accessing data multiple heterogeneous data sources 
describe tsimmis data model briefly extent necessary understand query language

suppose add books associate set names author author pen names real name 
accommodating new books oql environment require changing schema query longer correctly 
conventional query languages treat single set valued attributes differently 
sql attributes single valued 
xsql path expressions resulting set values require explicit quantifiers predicates appear select clauses kks :10.1.1.50.9598
lorel treats single set valued attributes uniformly 
attributes path expressions set valued implicit existential quantifier assumed 
example lorel path expression predicate book author name samuel matches path book object author object name object value samuel see section details 
wants treat path expressions resulting set values sets aggregation universal quantification lorel provides additional constructs purpose section 
research heterogeneous database integration focused integrating data structured databases 
particular systems pegasus unisql kim designed integrate data objectoriented relational databases 
spectrum systems gaia fre acl kif gf provide uniform access data minimal structure 
handle cyclic data length object sequences matching practice limited constant 
goal tsimmis project uniformly handle unstructured semistructured structured data pgmw :10.1.1.47.5182:10.1.1.47.5182

approaches tend extend existing data models languages bcd 
ideas lorel extend existing language 
choice design new language advantages disadvantages course 
approach easily built top take advantage environments corba ole 
shown lorel compares oql xsql sql 
lorel relates similar ways number query languages objectoriented bcd har nested relational systems 
final important difference lorel query languages simplicity object model yields fewer concepts query language resulting language believe appropriate casual user 
data model tsimmis project developed simple data model called oem object exchange model pgmw essentially tagged values :10.1.1.47.5182
object model identifier label value 
identifier uniquely identifies object objects domain interest 
label string tag presumably denoting meaning object 
labels may group objects assigning label related objects 
generally omitted clause absence wildcards deduced rest query include example clarity 
select foreach frodos restaurant frodos restaurant name frodos restaurant category type bbb restaurant rating bbb rating frodos bbb bbb restaurant name frodos restaurant name result query answer name blues bay type bbb rating subqueries correlation appear select clause powerful tool materializing complex result structures database 
illustrated full power 
example possible foreach clause contain path expression foreach clauses may nested depth 
subqueries correlation extension generalization oid functions available xsql kks powerful construction expressions provided oql cat apply sets structures :10.1.1.50.9598

convinced importance formally specifying language semantics 
defining denotational semantics lorel helped discover resolve number discrepancies omissions informal understanding 
areas language improved

working completion repository version plan places tsimmis framework shown 
intend add data modification statements language develop set equivalent query plan transformations query optimization 
intend explore specification exploitation integrity constraints language system add monitoring active database capabilities
