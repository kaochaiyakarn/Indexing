proceedings eighteenth international conference distributed computing systems icdcs amsterdam netherlands may economics market distributed scheduling william walsh michael wellman peter wurman jeffrey mackie mason university michigan ann arbor mi usa wellman umich edu market mechanisms solve distributed scheduling problems allocating scheduled resources market prices 
model distributed scheduling discrete resource allocation problem demonstrate applicability economic analysis framework 
drawing results literature discuss existence equilibrium prices general classes scheduling problems quality equilibrium solutions 
auction protocols implementing solutions analyze computational economic properties 
solving scheduling problems distributed computing systems presents particular challenges attributable distributed nature computation 
consider instance problem scheduling network access programs representing various users internet 
straightforward distributed scheduling policies come served shortest job priority combinations thereof generally possess properties 
example schemes insensitive relative value substance task performed 
hand priority schemes question set priorities desirable results follow 
self interested agents free set priorities incentive contrary specify maximum priority interested 
citing limitations proposed distributed resource allocation problems solved market mechanisms approach called market oriented programming :10.1.1.31.779
define agent activities terms resources required produced reducing agent decision problem evaluating tradeoffs acquiring different resources 
tradeoffs represented terms market prices define common scale value various resources 
problem designers computational markets specify configuration resources traded formally designated goods market mechanism agent interactions determine prices 
assuming scheduling problem decentralized markets provide advantages ffl markets naturally distributed 
proof 
provide proof exchange economy reserve prices 
extension account reserve values straightforward 
result confirms usual consequence competitive equilibrium gains trade name job length deadline value agent agent table problem equilibrium 
adapted demonstration price equilibria may exist fcc market radio spectrum :10.1.1.2.7819
possible result pareto optimal 
assume agent values expressible price units pareto optimality corresponds global optimality 
example agents described table reserve price zero
