proof denote positive disjunctive program obtained replacing undefined premises true premises similarly denote positive disjunctive program obtained replacing undefined premises false premises minimal model program program viewed subprogram program obtained removing clauses undefined premises model program minimal model equal show partial interpretation pos neg partial minimal model clear set consistent set literals 
show model suppose arbitrary clause suppose premises true implies premises undefined clause fact belongs premises true shows head true suppose arbitrary clause premises false implies premises false premises corresponding clause true 
shows atoms head true false proves model easy verify model equal satisfy os pos neg neg coincide proves minimal 
immediately shows model unique partial model proof shows non negative normal program equalities hold pos lpm pos lm neg lpm neg lm positive literals partial model lpm precisely positive literals model lm positive program obtained replacing undefined propositions false propositions negative atoms partial model lpm precisely negative literals model lm positive program obtained replacing undefined propositions true propositions fact compute partial models non negative normal programs
