case study case symbolic learning extended stefan wess christoph globig university kaiserslautern box kaiserslautern germany informatik uni kl de contrary symbolic learning approaches represent learned concept explicitly case approaches describe concepts implicitly pair cb sim measure similarity sim set cb cases 
poses question differences concerning learning power approaches 
article study relationship case base measure similarity target concept learning process 
transform simple symbolic learning algorithm version space algorithm equivalent case variant 
achieved results strengthen hypothesis equivalence learning power symbolic case methods show measure case algorithm target concept 
article short version wess globig want compare learning power important learning paradigms symbolic case approach aha
