presents method vision reinforcement learning robot learns shoot ball goal 
shown computer simulations assume ideal sensors actuators easily construct state action spaces consistent 
typical example asada grid environment robot take action going forward backward left right state encoded coordinate grid absolute global positioning system assumed 
uncertainties sensor actuator outputs considered stochastic transition model state space model account accumulation sensor errors estimating robot position 
viewpoint real robot applications construct state space re ect outputs physical sensors currently available mounted robot 
applications reported control robot arms mobile robots initial controller correct reward function advance :10.1.1.75.7884
robot learns control policy great deal knowledge environment
