textural features image database retrieval presents feature extraction methods decision methods retrieve images having section user input image 
features variances gray level occurrences ratio statistics constituted histogram angles intersecting lines ratio mean gray levels inside outside regions spanned angles 
decision method involves associating pair images class relevant irrelevant 
gaussian classifier nearest neighbor classifier 
protocol translates frame image automatically define pair images relevance class irrelevance class discussed 
experiments database gray scale images groundtruth image pairs showed classifier assigned image pairs sure relevant relevance class correctly
