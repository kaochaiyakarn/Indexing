nearest neighbor searching problem set data points metric space asked preprocess points query point data point nearest reported quickly 
nearest neighbor searching applications areas including knowledge discovery data mining pattern recognition classification machine learning data compression multimedia databases document retrieval statistics :10.1.1.35.8359
difficulty obtaining algorithms efficient worst case respect space query time suggests alternative problem finding approximate nearest neighbors 
consider set data points query point ffl say point ffl approximate nearest neighbor dist ffl dist support national science foundation ccr gratefully acknowledged 
true nearest neighbor words relative error ffl true nearest neighbor 
approximate nearest neighbor problem heavily studied
