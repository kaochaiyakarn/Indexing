performing careful analysis task environment designer determine broad space mechanisms perform desired activity 
aloimonos describes system performs number tasks including tracking 
researchers built vision systems designed extract useful high level information building detailed depth maps 
aloimonos describes number motion algorithms recover information useful navigation having solve general structure motion problem 
describes minimalist approach early vision particularly stereo 
swain describes system recognizing colored objects geometric information whatsoever :10.1.1.132.5942
various researchers developed systems directly detecting occluding contours measuring depth see forrest 
horswill disparity filtering implement proximity detection stereo images 
aloimonos system extracts number useful pieces high level information presence moving objects direction translation looming 
argued task recognition simpler bottom recognition formal complexity standpoint 
arbitrarily difficult consider case set 
fortunately specific cues allow objects recognized specific contexts 
call cues salience functions 
information type salience function conditionally equivalent constraint salience constraint 
simple easily computed functions find particular classes objects common ai see swain turk horswill brooks biological world see roitblat :10.1.1.132.5942
coloring algorithm uses texture detector salience function 
want determine salience constraint required texture detector 
simplicity restrict fourier measures texture 
effectively texture detector examines small patch image 
edge detector filter reduce system edges column heights derivation summarized table 
derivation shows background texture constraint simplify ground separation 
importantly shows constraint 
wish run system environment satisfy background texture constraint satisfy ground plane constraint salience constraint holds domain 
example background distinctive color set colors color system swain color histogram method find carpet color column heights wanted build system worked domains implement color system edge detector switch opportunistically provided sufficient information determine :10.1.1.132.5942
