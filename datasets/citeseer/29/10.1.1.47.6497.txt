mimic finding optima estimating probability densities jeremy de bonet charles jr paul viola artificial intelligence laboratory massachusetts institute technology cambridge ma optimization problems structure solutions reflects complex relationships different input parameters 
example experience may tell certain parameters closely related explored independently 
similarly experience may establish subset parameters take particular values 
search cost landscape take advantage relationships 
mimic framework analyze global structure optimization landscape 
novel efficient algorithm estimation structure derived
