new face recognition approaches needed progress identify face taken different viewpoints robustly identify faces different illumination conditions facial expression changes part face occluded account glasses parts clothing 
face recognition methods worked past possible image variations learned 
principal components analysis pca fisher discriminant analysis fda known cases methods 
different approach indexing face images 
approach identifying frontal faces allows reasonable variability facial expressions illumination conditions occlusions caused eye wear items clothing 
approach uses hidden markov models hmms identify index face images database static dynamic video images 
past researchers worked principal components analysis pca approaches face identification 
general face images multimedia database may taken different illumination conditions correspond different facial expressions may suffer different degrees occlusion wearing sun glasses seen occlusion problem images may taken different viewpoint 
identification procedure designed way unaffected distortions 
progress identifying face images taken different viewpoints lot done account different illumination conditions facial expressions resolving occlusion problem :10.1.1.38.5998
solution illumination problem proposed eliminate largest eigenvectors eigenspace empirically shown largest eigenvectors mainly represent changes illumination conditions 
main problems approach priori known illumination changes sample images note changes elimination largest eigenvectors system learn worse eigenspace vectors ones best describe sample faces shown possible combination illumination changes approach correct losing information information eigenvectors related illumination conditions 
took route proposing fisher discriminant analysis fda
