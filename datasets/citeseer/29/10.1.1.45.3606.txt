need indexing scheme support map authors manage large number actors spatio temporal relationships required 
current authoring tools provide facilities 
sample requirements include actors appear application specific time instance spatial layout screen layout specific time instance application temporal layout application terms temporal intervals spatio temporal relationship set actors application actor spatially overlap actor application actors temporally overlap actor propose indexing schemes large multimedia applications order assist authors manage large number actors spatial temporal layouts parts entire application answer queries regarding spatio temporal relationships actors

literature concerning area spatial databases data structures proposed manipulation spatial data 
trees variants efficient ones :10.1.1.131.7887
hand manipulation temporal information supported dimensional versions data structures designed dimensional space general specialized temporal data structures 
uniformity reasons select single multidimensional data structure tree play role spatial tree temporal tree index

retrieval objects spatio temporal relationships overlap demands access indexes second phase computation intersection set qq od time od od ri answer sets 
access indexes usually costly cases elements answer sets intersection set 
words disk accesses index separately useless 
reduce problem techniques spatial join trees example proposed applied indexing scheme :10.1.1.72.4514
