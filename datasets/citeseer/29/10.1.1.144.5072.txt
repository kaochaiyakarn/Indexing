evaluating functional joins nested sets object relational object oriented databases jens kemper informatik passau passau germany lastname db fm uni passau de www db uni passau de previous functional joins constrained ways approaches know assume implemented physical object identifiers oids approaches addition limited single valued attributes 
severe limitations object relational object oriented database systems support nested sets object systems implement location independent logical oids 
develop new functional join algorithm realization form oids physical logical particularly geared supporting functional joins nested sets 
algorithm applied evaluate joins arbitrarily long path expressions may include sets 
new algorithm generalizes previously proposed partition pointer joins repeatedly applying partitioning interleaved re merging evaluating functional join 
consequently algorithm termed pm stands partitioning denotes merging
