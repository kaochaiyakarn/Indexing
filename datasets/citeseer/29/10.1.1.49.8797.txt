approach frustrating users abandoned areas computing 
propose new online aggregation interface permits users observe progress aggregation queries control execution fly 
outlining usability performance requirements system supporting online aggregation suite techniques extend database system meet requirements 
include methods returning output random order providing control relative rate different aggregates computed computing running confidence intervals 
report initial implementation online aggregation postgres 
increase power online aggregation interface traditional interfaces calls powerful statistical estimation techniques 
previous methods double sampling computing confidence intervals assume records sampled techniques appropriate setting online aggregation 
previous focused primarily count queries number formulas proposed inequality 
provide confidence interval formulas see section appendix applicable wider variety aggregation queries

discussion focused issues pertinent statistical estimation important remember benefit derived online aggregation statistical nature 
ongoing feedback provided online aggregation interface allows intuitive non statistical insight progress query 
permits ongoing non textual non statistical representations query output 
common example appearance data map graph retrieved database 
techniques inappropriate online aggregation queries indexed attributes 
example column contains copies value copies value ordered grouped access tuples return wildly skewed online estimates average column 
attributes indexed aggregated query index scan produce appropriately random access values attributes aggregated assuming correlation attributes 

sampling indices olken presents techniques pseudo random sampling various index structures :10.1.1.144.4987
techniques ideal producing meaningful confidence intervals 
hand efficient heap scans standard index scans require repeated probing random index buckets defeat optimizations clustering prefetching
