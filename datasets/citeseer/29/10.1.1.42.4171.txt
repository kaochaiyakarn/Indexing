coordinate retrieval documents different search engines suppose databases ranked order briefly review algorithm determines value databases searched documents databases form list documents returned user :10.1.1.50.4709
suppose databases invoked metasearch engine 
search engines returns degree relevance relevant document metasearch engine computes minimum values 
search engines returns documents metasearch engine degrees relevance greater equal minimum 
number documents single search engine degrees relevance greater equal minimum value greater search engine returns documents largest degrees relevance 
remaining ones useful user wants documents largest degrees relevance 
total add doc add doc constant tradeoff effectiveness efficiency retrieval documents returned multiple search engines metasearch engine documents sorted descending order degree relevance documents returned user 
database order invoked process repeated add doc documents returned metasearch engine 
shown databases ranked optimally databases containing desired documents ahead databases query algorithm retrieve relevant documents respect query 
proof essentially replace similarity document degree relevance :10.1.1.50.4709
add doc documents received metasearch engine comparison case add doc
