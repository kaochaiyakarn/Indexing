sdcc framework integrating existing algorithms diverse data warehouse maintenance tasks xin zhang elke rundensteiner department computer science worcester polytechnic institute worcester ma cs wpi edu proposed view maintenance algorithms tackle problem concurrent data updates happening different autonomous iss eve system addresses maintenance data warehouse schema changes iss 
concurrency schema changes data updates remains unexplored problem 
provides solution guarantees concurrent view definition evolution view extent maintenance dw defined distributed iss 
problem introduce framework called sdcc schema change data update concurrency control system 
sdcc integrates existing algorithms designed address view maintenance subproblems view extent maintenance data updates view definition evolution schema changes view extent adaptation view definition changes system providing protocols enable correctly exist collaborate 
sdcc tracks potential faulty updates dw caused conflicting concurrent changes compensates conflicting updates local correction strategy called local compensation lc
