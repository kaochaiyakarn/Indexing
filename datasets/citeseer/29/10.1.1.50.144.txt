mdl inspired penalty applied tests eliminating consideration altering relative desirability tests 
empirical trials show modifications lead smaller decision trees higher predictive accuracies 
results confirm new version incorporating changes superior approaches global discretization construct small trees multi interval splits 

empirical learning systems set pre classified cases described vector attribute values construct mapping attribute values classes

results section show straightforward changes continuous attributes lead improvement performance learning tasks investigated 
pruned trees substantially smaller somewhat accurate especially presence irrelevant attributes
