constructing realistic head animation mesh specific person ulrich neumann li jun yong noh douglas tae yong kim integrated media systems center computer science department usc interfaces addresses problem constructing realistic complete animation mesh specific person head geometry texture 
approach prototype mesh containing vector delineated muscles fit geometric models obtained stereo image pairs specific person head 
resulting personalized mesh facilitates animation realism predictability original prototype mesh 
model construction requires manual interaction automatic refinement methods reduce need precision 
sensing process passive physical markers needed person face 
models produced method suited realistic animations specific individuals applications special effects games teleconferencing
