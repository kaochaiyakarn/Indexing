data replication distributed databases investigated extensively hope improve performance reliability availability 
growth internet shown current replica management techniques poor performance large unreliable networks dynamic topology restricted single item updates commutative updates distributed file systems name servers support multi item multi operational transactional semantics :10.1.1.12.7323
supporting true database semantics serializability presents challenges distributed systems 
periods reporting update branch database maintain temporary local copies consolidated summary data update process efficient 
reporting period temporary data longer needed branch locations deleted room reporting different class data 
goal find protocol support distributed database 
approach epidemic dissemination information network connecting copies 
epidemic approach especially suited sending information networks unreliable subject congestion unknown dynamic topology :10.1.1.12.7323

vector clocks detect possible relationships events

vector clocks ensure property iff additionally site maintains event log transaction operations

receives message applies updates received log records updates time table atomic step reflect new information received 
site receives log record knows log records causally preceding events received previous messages included message

transaction oriented epidemic update protocols epidemic protocols developed single update operations :10.1.1.12.7323
describe epidemic update protocol supporting multi operation transactional semantics 
transaction starts execution initiating site acquiring locks performing computation writing values database 
transaction pre commits follows transaction read committed time processing needed 
site local time incremented transaction gets pre commit timestamp site puts record describing transaction event log sequential log transaction pre commit records 
site local time incremented transaction gets pre commit timestamp site puts record describing transaction event log sequential log transaction pre commit records 
pre commit record contains readset writeset values written pre commit timestamp read locks held transaction released 
timestamp row time table component incremented 
timestamp assignment ensures dominates transactions pre committed regardless initiated 
point transaction record spread system epidemic messages :10.1.1.12.7323
pre committing transaction release read locks obtained write locks retained termination 
pre commit termination possibility transaction aborted due conflicts pre committed transactions 
site contacts site initiate epidemic transfer determines log records received 
transaction records condition aborting false records believes unknown site sent message time table 
transaction predicates proceedings nd international conference distributed computing systems icdcs ieee condition committing correct knows received transaction received concurrent conflicting transaction initiated 
knows sites received information needs commit abort 
record needed locally deleted 
protocol ensures serializability shown require costly global deadlock detection 
asynchronous propagation approach replicated information demonstrated useful maintaining global information distributed systems :10.1.1.12.7323
