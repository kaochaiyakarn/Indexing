distributed control team mobile robots presents number unique challenges including highly unreliable communication real world task safety constraints scalability dynamic heterogenous platforms lack standardized tools techniques 
similar problems plagued development single robots applications behavior revolution led new techniques robot control port behaviors 
implementations systems behavior control single robots potential distributing control robots multi agent control fully realized 
presents ayllu system distributed multi robot behavioral control 
ayllu allows standard interaction message passing inhibition suppression take place ip networks extends paradigm provide arbitrary scalability 
unfortunately behavior language mars limited specific target development platforms seen widespread 
systems built implement behavior control captured elegance ease inter behavior message passing inhibition suppression 
believe lack widely available implementation basic substrate behavior systems major reasons approach seen problematic scaling see 
furthermore behavior language facilities behaviors distributed robots 
alliance architecture provide style control robots communication robots generalize communication arbitration techniques behaviors different robots :10.1.1.14.755
believe extending notion connections networks distributed computers ip able open wide range new simple robust algorithms multi robot coordination 
ayllu developed purpose 
ayllu distributed control ayllu extension language intended development distributed control systems groups mobile robots 
facilitates communication distributed system components scheduling tasks
