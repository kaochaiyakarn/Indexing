exploiting planned disconnections mobile environments agrawal el abbadi department computer science university california santa barbara santa barbara ca agrawal cs ucsb edu notion distributed database entirely mobile components 
disconnections frequent environment develop disconnection reconnection procedure allow normal processing connected components 
briefly discuss protocol epidemic communication support system ensuring copy serializability 
mobile computers wireless networks integrated variety enterprises different applications 
prevailing mode operation occasional disconnection single user rapidly evolve situation users disconnecting networks created ad hoc manner wireless network meeting room 
result mobile computers integrated class entities distributed information systems 
members need gather form ad hoc network different geographical locations 
database consistency transaction serializability important 
distributed system able process database updates team members available 
desirable designate members primary site network formed members equal participants 
protocol propose support mobile system uses epidemic style communication epidemic communication require distributed system member continuously connected traditional replica management systems :10.1.1.127.832
members individually propose updates system state com updates members epidemic communication 
periodically member decides contact member exchange information 
kind pair wise communication knowledge proposed updates spreads epidemic system 
members connect short time exchange epidemic messages disconnect 
members connect short time exchange epidemic messages disconnect 
model suited supporting users mobile disconnected environments 
epidemic model propagate updates knowledge updates eventually reaches members team 
asynchronous nature epidemic communication suitable mobile environments runs risk large delays situations participation members required 
intend notion planned disconnection address problem :10.1.1.39.2488
reasonable computers distributed database go sign procedure disconnecting tell remaining members expect acknowledgments votes disposition shared data 
need pulling plug strange modern computer user 
operating systems microsoft windows linux sunos require shut process computer turned 
ignoring complicate things power restored 
ignoring complicate things power restored 
similarly define sign procedure normal connection session 
ignored reconnect procedure complicated 
propose way members mobile team disconnect long period time minimal disruption normal database processing epidemic update protocol sign disconnect reconnect procedures 
protocols allowing disconnection proposed aware provide transactional semantics guarantee full serializability write environment :10.1.1.39.2488
mobile distributed database management database exists mobile computers forming mobile distributed database data items partially completely replicated 
refer persons team team members computers system members simply members 
require members stationary connected network 
members fully capable generating transactions read update disconnected members process readonly transactions 
point commit pre commit record propagated system members epidemic communication 
members aware perform necessary synchronization communicate action epidemic messages 
transactions execute single system member independent members pre commit adapt algorithm mobile environment 
mobile distributed database member may execute operations unilaterally disconnected updates committed verified conflicting updates executed members 
member team decides disconnect say attend executive meeting team members remain connected continue process transactions allow planned disconnection :10.1.1.39.2488
planned disconnection connected team members able commit updates get acknowledgment vote disconnected member 
add procedure team members wants disconnect long duration inform distributed database system going line 
idea give member connected right acknowledge updates vote place disconnected member 
call right vote proxy
