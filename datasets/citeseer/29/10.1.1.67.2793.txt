combinatorial optimization algorithms mechanism parameter dependencies 
modeling dependencies may allow algorithm concentrate sampling effectively regions appeared promising past 
algorithm incrementally learns second order probability distributions far uses statistics generate optimal terms maximum likelihood dependency trees model distributions stochastically gen new candidate solutions trees 
test algorithm variety optimization problems 
results indicate superior performance tested algorithms explicitly dependencies dependencies generate restricted class
