correspondence description logics propositional modal logic techniques carry propositional modal logic satisfiability checking 
currently implemented representation systems employ techniques fact dlp effective satisfiable checkers various propositional modal logics

various schemes computing subsumption relationship depending expressive power description logic degree completeness system 
description logic systems perform numerous subsumption checks course operations need highly optimised subsumption checker 
shown determining subsumption expressive description logics equivalent determining satisfiability formulae propositional modal dynamic logics

description logic systems built description logics include essentially satisfiability checker including kris crack :10.1.1.10.8047
systems incorporated number optimisations achieve better performance subsumption checkers
