generate common dimensional cross tab requires aggregation functions group operators union operators standard sql 
bike total black white total bike total mountain black bike white city black bike white black white total table 
sales summary dimensional cross tab dimensional cross tab structure result table conform commonly accepted relations 
standard sql express multidimensional cross tab dw users 
user easily express roll cross tab query extension sql group proposed :10.1.1.120.4505
group column name expression correlation name clause cube rollup sql extension generate table results select product type year color sum sales sales product type bike year group product type year color cube leads questions 
transform relational results cube rollup operators multidimensional forms 
architecture proposed task performed application interface layer 
second ciently implement rollup operators 
functions allowed group clause simply say select day sum sales sales group day time day common format decision makers 
data multidimensional model 
gures kernel table facts multidimensional model upper row leftmost column dimensions product name color years 
right column rows summaries generated operators cube rollup 
details proposed extensions see :10.1.1.120.4505
useful extensions red brick intelligent sql rank integer
