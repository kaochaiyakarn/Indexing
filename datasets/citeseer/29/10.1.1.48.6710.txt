ripper classifies document applying set boolean tests check absence presence words documents 
ripper capable dealing multiple labels 
ripper learns classifier form boolean combination simple terms 
provide ranking possible labels document 
class build prototype vector average weight vector documents formally fij prototype vector class jx test documents classified calculating dot products weight vector representing document prototype vectors 
dot products induce ranking possible labels
