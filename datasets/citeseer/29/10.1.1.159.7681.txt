nfs design nfs achieves architecture operating system independence strict separation protocol implementation 
protocol interface clients access files server 
client server implements protocol mapping local file system actions file system model defined nfs 
nfs protocol dictate server implements interface client interface satyanarayanan 
example nfs version protocol define client manage cached data provide information improve cache management 
implementations illustrate aspects nfs protocol specification final description clients access servers 
semantic details fully described nfs version specification rfc proven practice problem worked interoperability testing 
problems flaws implementations protocol design 
nfs protocol stateless request contains sufficient information completely processed regard requests 
server need maintain state previous requests file data stable storage map file handles opaque tokens clients access files files derived file system data 
course servers cache file data synchronized disk improve performance 
cached data needed correct operation 
server crash recovery simple 
client need retry request server responds client know server rebooted user may notice delayed responses 
experience sun network disk nd earlier method sharing disk storage network led stateless server requirement initial design nfs joy 
nfs version protocol requires modified data server flushed stable storage replying 
asynchronous writes 
nfs clients block close data flushed stable storage server return errors application occur delayed writes example space 
nfs clients decidedly stateless 
nfs clients hold modified data flushed server cache file handles attributes 
clients typically attribute information file modification time validate cached information 
client crashes recovery necessary client server 
precise reply cache server contains volatile state needed correctness kazar 
see discussion reply cache implications server correctness 
tcp implementations nfs need reply cache prevent destructive replay connection re establishment 
nfs servers stupid nfs clients smart 
nfs version offers possibility potentially smarter clients 

multiple version support remote procedure call rpc protocol provides explicit support multiple versions service rfc 
client server implementations nfs version provide backward compatibility nfs version supporting nfs version nfs version 
default rpc client server bind highest version number support 
client server implementations support versions example due memory restrictions support nfs version 

implementation issues primary goal restricting changes nfs version nfs version minimize new implementation issues 
implementation issues exist areas bit file sizes offsets asynchronous writes readdirplus read directory attributes nfs err jukebox weak cache consistency issues bit file sizes offsets bit extensions nfs version introduce problems mismatched clients servers bit client bit server bit client bit server 
bit client encounter file handle bit server 
sends request server handle server return nfs err 
problems posed bit client bit server difficult 
server handle client generate 
client handle file size expressed bits properly decode size file local attributes structure 
solution client deny access file size expressed bits 
introduces anomalous behavior file extended client limit rendering file inaccessible 
solution client map size greater handle maximum size handle effectively lying application program 
allows application access file possible bit offset restriction 
solution eliminates anomalous behavior described solution introduces problem client able access part file 
solutions exist 
asynchronous writes nfs version asynchronous writes eliminate synchronous write bottleneck nfs version 
server receives asynchronous write request permitted reply client immediately 
client sends commit request verify data reached stable storage server reply commit safely stores data 
asynchronous writes defined nfs version effective large files 
client send write requests send single commit flush entire file disk closes file 
allows server single large write file systems handle efficiently series small writes 
large files server flush data background disk commit request arrives 
asynchronous writes optional nfs version specific client server implementations choose support feature 
server choose flush asynchronous write requests stable storage 
case server indicates write reply 
clients insufficient memory support necessary buffering required server crash recovery request synchronous writes 
crash recovery design asynchronous writes consistent stupid server smart client philosophy nfs 
client required keep copy uncommitted data support recovery server crash 
replies write commit requests include write verifier clients detect server crashes 
write verifier byte value server change crashes 
servers commonly boot time write verifier guaranteed unique crash 
client save write verifier returned asynchronous write request compare write verifier returned commit request 
write verifiers match client assumes server crashed rebooted 
client rewrite uncommitted data 
clients push data synchronous writes server failure 
client delay rewriting data detects crash avoid flooding newly rebooted server write requests 
shows synchronous write page clean application write page dirty file normal asynchronous write page written unsuccessful commit page dirty client file recovery successful commit 
client page states asynchronous writes digital osf implementation 
diagram shows state changes occur page memory containing file data modified written committed 
local application modifies page marked dirty 
client asynchronously writes data server 
client stores write verifier asynchronous write request page 
explicit fsync close application file system sync page reclamation trigger commit 
write verifier returned commit request compared stored written pages 
page write verifier matches returned verifier commit succeeds 
write verifier page match returned write verifier triggering recovery 
client synchronously writes data server 
state changes occur page memory containing file data modified written server committed 
server details nfs version server guarantees synchronous write request server commit stable storage data modified metadata 
server discard uncommitted data changing write verifier 
server commit file data modified metadata stable storage range specified commit request reporting success 
conditions arise write verifier change 
example server change write verifier failover nfs version forms basis non shared memory highly available implementation nfs 
unsynchronized data available backup processor guarantee primary processor able flush uncommitted data stable storage going 
server shut cleanly advantageous save write verifier reuse server brought back line 
avoids triggering client rewrites committed data 
data sharing asynchronous writes write sharing higher level application synchronization protocol attractive nfs version 
nfs version clients preserve close open consistency clients typically block close data flushed server stable storage revalidate cached data attribute check open 
strictly speaking close open consistency implementation practice 
data sharing semantics nfs version differ nfs version nfs version server reboots loses uncommitted data 
write sharing nfs version clients supported absence locking changes essentially undefined behavior considered major issue 
readdirplus nfs version contains new operation called readdirplus returns file handles attributes addition directory information returned readdir 
readdirplus exploits observed request sequences generated nfs version clients 
example unix user types ls dir browse directory containing entries ls command opens target directory reads calls stat times 
nfs version readdir request followed sequential lookup requests retrieve attributes file handles 
nfs version single readdirplus retrieves name list attributes entries significantly reducing command execution time 
drawbacks readdirplus 
readdirplus expensive corresponding readdir 
results implementation generates exclusively readdirplus requests show performance drop attributes entries directory fetched repeatedly access directory 
readdirplus operation viewed way get contents directory populate name attribute caches entries directory time 
readdirplus operation reading directory time directory cache entry invalidated directory modified 
readdirplus issued valid cache entry directory exists readdirplus operation issued populate various caches directory entry attributes file handles 
nfs err jukebox nfs err jukebox lets servers inform clients file temporarily inaccessible archived offline locked modification backup retry request 
intended improve behavior nfs hierarchical storage management applications 
nfs version server performs actions file temporarily inaccessible 
action drop request forces client normal back retransmission 
request satisfied time retry 
second action server block service thread file accessible 
second action implemented inadvertently clients employ mechanisms gain parallelism emit related requests file blocking server threads hang server 
third action return error client rejecting request 
nfs version server returns nfs err jukebox file temporarily inaccessible 
client operating system return error application handles internally aggressively delaying reissue request reducing server load due request retransmission 
tunable delay request reissued 
client term jukebox long standing joke nfs community 
kept historical error name incorrectly implies binding particular hsm mechanism 
generic intent error nfs err tmp inaccessible appropriate 
reissue request transmission id weak cache consistency nfs version clients cache file directory data improve performance 
determine cached data valid client sends getattr request 
new modification time server matches modification time client cached attributes client assumes cache date 
modification times don match file changed client invalidates cache 
method fails client modifies file cached 
example client writes part file cached data parts probably valid 
impossible client sure client write request updated file modification time 
client keep cache data dangerous cautious client invalidate cache slow 
weak cache consistency offers alternative helping clients determine accurately invalidate cache 
reply nfs version request modify data includes versions file attributes pre operation attributes just server performed operation post operation attributes just operation 
modification time pre operation attributes server matches cached attributes client client cache valid 
client update attribute cache new post operation attributes 
weak cache consistency provide true consistency sprite nelson 
weak cache consistency clients see inconsistent view server data 
example client modified file locally flushed new data server 
second client verify modification times file opened cached attributes time 
result second client cache may date 
servers may unable generate pre operation attributes clients prepared fall back nfs version behavior 
weak cache consistency just hint client implementations free ignore 
issues changes nfs version impose extra client 
nfs version requests optional return file handle attribute information mandatory nfs version 
example nfs version create request return file handle attributes newly created file nfs version return optional 
result nfs version client prepared issue lookup create case server return file handle new file 
furthermore nfs version optional lookup return attributes client prepared issue getattr 
nfs version servers required accept data write request 
nfs version server accept data write client expected send rest second time 
example client send byte request server choose accept byte 
client prepared send remaining bytes second time server choose accept entire request 
practice features problem server implementations return optional information accept entire contents write requests 

changes related protocols nfs version continues philosophy building network file service collection cooperating protocols 
mount protocol mount allows nfs client gain access exported directory server network lock manager protocol nlm supports remote file locking nfs 
changes file handle file size fields nfs version required corresponding changes mount nlm new versions protocols released 
new mount specification allows successful mount return list acceptable rpc authentication flavors des kerberos client 
automounter facilities information correctly access servers require certain flavors authentication 
new mount protocol slightly cleaner previous 
example legal error values enumerated allowing unix error number
