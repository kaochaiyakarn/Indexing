evolving video skims useful multimedia abstractions michael christel michael smith roy taylor david winkler reports studies measured effects different video skim techniques comprehension navigation user satisfaction 
video skims compact content rich abstractions longer videos preserve frame rate greatly reducing viewing time 
characteristics depend image audio processing techniques create 
results initial study helped refine video skims second experiment 
significant benefits skims built audio sequences meeting certain criteria
