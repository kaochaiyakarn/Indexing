amulet environment new models effective user interface software development brad myers rich rob miller alan patrick andrew ellen andy alex november cmu cs cmu human computer interaction institute school computer science carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa cs cmu edu www cs cmu edu amulet amulet user interface development environment easier programmers create highly interactive graphical user interface software unix windows macintosh 
amulet uses new models objects constraints animation input output commands undo 
object system prototype instance model distinction classes instances methods data 
constraint system allows value object computed arbitrary code supports multiple constraint solvers 
animations attached existing objects single line code 
input user handled interactor objects support reuse behavior objects

creating user interface software proven difficult expensive 
user interface software large complex challenging implement debug modify 
study average applications code devoted user interface implementation time devoted user interface portion :10.1.1.18.7394
today toolkits interactive tools quite hard lack flexibility 
example create new kinds widgets scroll bar handles add support gesture recognition quite difficult today tools 
amulet new user interface development environment runs windows windows nt macintosh facilitates user interface research development 
amulet aims design prototyping implementation evaluation user interfaces significantly easier supporting flexible experimentation new styles 
examples applications show interactors moving selecting objects 
note simplest cases object interactive single line code allow object moved left mouse button held object add part am move grow interactor create allow part added group grown right button group add part am move grow interactor create set am growing true set am start event right allow parts group selected left button group add part am choice interactor create set am set am choice list toggle discussion interactor model successful implementation model view controller idea smalltalk 
model contains data view presents data controller manipulates view 
previous systems including original smalltalk implementation view controller tightly linked controller reimplemented view changed vice versa 
systems andrew interviews combined view controller amulet environment called view :10.1.1.17.6306
contrast amulet interactors independent graphics reused different contexts 
common design systems just graphical object standard set methods events handles example selected moving 
visual basic example design programmer code methods activated user clicks drags object 
number advantages amulet design having explicit objects interactors representing behaviors graphics
