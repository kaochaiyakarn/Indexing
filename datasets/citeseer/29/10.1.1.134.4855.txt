data mining approaches intrusion detection discuss research developing general systematic methods intrusion detection 
key ideas data mining techniques discover consistent useful patterns system features describe program user behavior set relevant system features compute inductively learned classifiers recognize anomalies known intrusions 
experiments sendmail system call data network tcpdump data demonstrate construct concise accurate classifiers detect anomalies 
provide overview general data mining algorithms implemented association rules algorithm frequent episodes algorithm 
algorithms compute intra inter audit record patterns essential describing program user behavior 
discovered patterns guide audit data gathering process facilitate feature selection 
intrusion detection needed wall protect computer systems 
elements central intrusion detection resources protected target system user accounts file systems system kernels models characterize normal legitimate behavior resources techniques compare actual system activities established models identify abnormal intrusive 
researchers proposed implemented different models define different measures system behavior ad hoc presumption anomaly accurately manifested chosen set system features modeled measured 
intrusion detection techniques categorized misuse detection uses patterns wellknown attacks weak spots system identify intrusions anomaly detection tries determine deviation established normal age patterns flagged intrusions 
misuse detection systems example ks stat encode match sequence signature actions change ownership file known intrusion scenarios :10.1.1.17.9158:10.1.1.17.9158
main shortcomings systems known intrusion patterns hand coded system unable detect unknown intrusions matched patterns stored system 
anomaly detection sub systems ides establish normal usage patterns profiles statistical measures system features example cpu activities particular user program 
main difficulties systems intuition experience relied selecting system features vary greatly different computing environments intrusions detected studying sequential events event may fit profiles 
research aims eliminate possible manual ad hoc elements process building intrusion detection system
