characterization parallelization decision tree induction jeffrey bradford jos school electrical computer engineering purdue university west lafayette jeffrey bradford computer org purdue edu contact author jeffrey bradford box electrical engineering building west lafayette voice fax jeffrey bradford computer org examines performance memory access behavior decision tree induction program representative example data mining applications uniprocessor parallel implementations 
goals characterize particular memory hierarchy usage decrease runtime algorithmic improvement parallelization 
performance studied execution driven simulator uniprocessor models exploit instruction level parallelism varying degrees 
contributions 
presents complete characterization decision tree induction program 
exception input dataset working set fits kb data cache instruction working set fits kb instruction cache 
purposes assumed entire dataset fits main memory 
reasonable assumption current computer systems contain gb main memory processor inducing decision tree gb dataset currently requires cpu days 
possible modify algorithm allow dataset core aware study investing performance impact core decision tree algorithms 
core version requires seconds processors subtree increasing memory allow dataset core decreases runtime seconds showing run time dominated 
sprint claim handle core datasets performance numbers provided core datasets :10.1.1.104.152
dataset typically partitioned disjoint sets training set testing set 
training set induce decision tree provide unbiased accuracy estimate 
separate set instances testing set accuracy estimation 
unbiased accuracy estimation useful developing algorithms wants know algorithm performs accuracy estimation useful applying data mining programs practice wants know confidence place patterns

parallelization system previous parallel implementations decision tree induction program exist 
include sliq sprint message passing systems subtree mlc induction algorithm sgi mineset package smps :10.1.1.42.5335:10.1.1.104.152
systems increasingly popular platform parallel computing aware studies decision tree induction system investigates parallelize decision tree induction system characteristics performance resultant program 
results section show uniprocessor relatively fast memory hierarchy cycle hit time cycles hit time cycles main memory aggressive memory latency tolerance mechanisms non blocking cache order issue shows significant performance degradation due memory stall time 
due version optimized uniform memory access time smp perform poorly system 
parallelize system significant effort required ensure memory possible local memory
