analysis order logics probability joseph halpern ibm almaden research center san jose ca halpern almaden ibm com consider approaches giving semantics order logics probability 
approach puts probability domain appropriate giving semantics formulas involving statistical information probability randomly chosen bird flies greater second approach puts probability possible worlds appropriate giving semantics formulas describing degrees belief probability tweety particular bird flies greater show approaches easily combined allowing reason straightforward way statistical information degrees belief 
consider axiomatizing logics 
general shown complete axiomatization possible 
provide axiom systems sound complete cases complete axiomatization possible showing allow capture great deal interesting reasoning probability
