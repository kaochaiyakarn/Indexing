mining quantitative association rules large relational tables ramakrishnan srikant ibm almaden research center san jose ca rakesh agrawal ibm almaden research center san jose ca introduce problem mining association rules large relational tables containing quantitative categorical attributes 
example association married people age cars 
deal quantitative attributes values attribute combining adjacent partitions necessary 
introduce measures partial completeness quantify information lost due partitioning 
direct application technique generate similar rules 
tackle problem greater expected value interest measure identify interesting rules output 
attributes categorical quantitative attributes values mapping straightforward 
conceptually having just field table attribute fields number attribute values 
value boolean field corresponding value attribute value original record 
domain values quantitative approach large obvious approach partition values intervals map pair boolean attribute 
algorithm finding boolean association rules find people age married minimum support minimum confidence rules sample support confidence hage example quantitative association rules quantitative association rules :10.1.1.40.6757
shows mapping non key attributes people table 
age partitioned intervals 
categorical attribute married boolean attributes married married 
number values small partitioned intervals value mapped boolean field 
rules interesting see 
tradeoff faster execution time fewer intervals mitigating reducing information loss intervals mitigating minconf 
reduce information loss increasing number intervals cost increasing execution time potentially generating uninteresting rules problem 
meaningful combine categorical attribute values taxonomy hierarchy attribute 
case taxonomy implicitly combine values categorical attribute see sa hf :10.1.1.144.4956
taxonomy manner somewhat similar considering ranges quantitative attributes 
age age married married mapping boolean association rules problem approach consider ranges adjacent values intervals quantitative attributes avoid minsup problem 
mitigate problem restrict extent adjacent values intervals may combined introducing user specified maximum support parameter combining intervals combined support exceeds value 
single interval value support exceeds maximum support considered

algorithm ps fairly straightforward 
frequent itemsets generate association rules 
general idea say abcd ab frequent itemsets determine rule ab cd holds computing ratio conf support abcd support ab 
conf minconf rule holds 
rule minimum support abcd frequent 
algorithm generate rules :10.1.1.40.6757

determine interesting rules output

example consider people table shown 
pr pr denote expected value pr support pr generalization itemset hz un ig set hz ig 
define pr pr pr hz pr hz theta delta delta delta theta pr hz un pr hz theta pr similarly pr pr denote expected confidence rule rule generalizations respectively 
itemset hy un ig set hy ig 
define pr pr pr hy pr hy theta delta delta delta theta pr hy un pr hy theta pr attribute support values interesting boring example interest tentative interest measure 
introduce measure similar sa :10.1.1.144.4956
itemset interesting ancestor support greater equal times expected support rule interesting ancestor support rule times expected support confidence times expected confidence set rules call close ancestor rule ancestor ancestor similar definition holds itemsets 
set rules minimum interest rule interesting ancestors interesting respect close ancestors interesting ancestors 
looking generalizations insufficient 
definition interest problem 
semantics case interested rules interest specified interest level 
algorithm section describe algorithm finding frequent itemsets step problem decomposition section 
stage partitioned quantitative attributes created combinations intervals quantitative attributes 
combinations values categorical attributes minimum support form frequent items 
starting frequent items generate frequent itemsets algorithm apriori algorithm finding boolean association rules :10.1.1.40.6757
proposed algorithm extends candidate generation procedure add pruning interest measure uses different data structure counting candidates 
itemset denote itemset having items 
represent set frequent itemsets set candidate itemsets potentially frequent itemsets 
algorithm multiple passes database 
categorical part super candidate contains item 
quantitative part contains information 
age split problem parts 
find super candidates supported categorical attributes record 
re hash tree data structure described reduce number super candidates need checked record :10.1.1.40.6757

know categorical attributes super candidate supported record need find candidates super candidate supported 
recall candidates super candidate values categorical values different values quantitative attributes
