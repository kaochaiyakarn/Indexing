formalisms proposed reasoning intelligent agents multi agent systems formalisms theories developed attempt explain aspects multiagent behaviour 
formalisms multiagent systems research taken starting point game theory mathematical logic :10.1.1.119.2204
researchers game theory focus primarily interactions self interested agents 
typical research programme starts identifying particular type interaction scenario prisoner dilemma asks best strategy agent placed scenario 
common research programme involves asking interaction protocol engineered participating agents behave rationally certain desirable outcomes guaranteed maximisation social welfare mechanism design
