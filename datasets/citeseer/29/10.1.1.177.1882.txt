information integration goal providing integrated coherent view data stored multiple possibly inhomogeneous information sources 
core problems distributed databases cooperative information systems data warehousing key areas software development industry :10.1.1.52.9238
early integration carried context database design focused socalled schema integration problem designing global unified schema database application starting produced independently 
efforts devoted information integration generalizes schema integration account actual data integration process 
input collection source data sets constituted schema actual data goal provide integrated reconciled view data residing sources 
integration system may principle access data update stored information 
input collection source data sets constituted schema actual data goal provide integrated reconciled view data residing sources 
integration system may principle access data update stored information 
performing updates integrated data requires changing data sources 
tight coordination sources integration system different sources needed 
form integration typically interest federated databases :10.1.1.118.6768
looser approach integration emerged autonomy sources basic requirement integration system seen client sources interfere operation 
performing updates integrated data concern reconciled view answering queries 
reason form integration called read integration 
approach organization responsible integration system typically different independent organizations managing single sources :10.1.1.127.3070

materialized information integration query answering generally efficient require access ing sources maintaining materialized views costly especially views upto date respect updates sources view refreshment

comparison existing systems show architecture outlined instantiated different information integration settings 
schema integration schema integration setting integration starts providing conceptual representation sources source models proceed generating global database schema enterprise model 
schema design implemented database materialized view schema materialized view store 
database created sources discarded conceptual level anymore 
multidatabases setting multidatabases deals different sources considered internal components integration system :10.1.1.118.6768
logical representation sources mediators designed order satisfy information needs expressed logical level query schemas 
mediators materialize data system 
typically conceptual level taken account 
global information systems setting goal provide tools integrated access multiple diverse autonomous information sources repositories databases html documents unstructured files :10.1.1.127.3070
