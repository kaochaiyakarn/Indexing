statistical corpus word sense disambiguation pseudowords vs real ambiguous words alfa informatica rijksuniversiteit groningen nl groningen netherlands rug nl investigate task disambiguating pseudowords artificial ambiguous words comparable disambiguation real ambiguous words 
methods inherently different direct comparison possible 
indirect approach taken setup systems similar possible corpus settings 
results obtained clearly indicate tasks quite different 
conclude current practice pseudowords taken substitute testing real ambiguous words 
word sense disambiguation difficult task

word sense disambiguation major problem natural language processing lexical ambiguity syntactic semantic 
word syntactic ambiguity resolved applying part speech taggers predict syntactic category word texts high levels accuracy see example brill brants 
problem resolving semantic ambiguity generally known word sense disambiguation wsd proved difficult syntactic disambiguation 
way determine meaning word particular usage examine context 
instance english word bank extensively cited example lexical ambiguity refer bank river institution 
reason computer program analyzing sentence boy bank cold water need decide reading bank intended order able come correct meaning sentence 
goal word sense disambiguation systems attribute correct sense words text 
ways approach problem knowledge approach uses explicit lexicon corpus disambiguation relevant information word senses gathered training large corpus third alternative hybrid approach combining aspects aforementioned methodologies see ide ronis thorough discussion
