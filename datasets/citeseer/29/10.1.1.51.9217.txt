generalized partial global planning gpgp task environment centered approach coordination :10.1.1.32.8351:10.1.1.37.4451
basic idea agent constructs local view structure relationships intended tasks 
view may augmented information agents may change ways dynamically time 
gpgp approach uses set individual coordination mechanisms help construct partial views recognize respond particular task structure relationships making commitments agents 
commitments result coherent coordinated behavior 
day physicians request certain tests therapy performed part diagnosis treatment patient 
tests performed separate independent located ancillary departments hospital 
radiology department example provides ray services may receive requests number different units hospital 
furthermore test may interact tests relationships enables requires gamma delay slight variation enables inhibits negative variation soft facilitates relationship 
task relationships indicate execution task changes characteristics primarily duration task :10.1.1.42.8231
view task structure hospital scheduling problem peculiar features ffl tasks redundancy 
test done single ancillary department 
ffl quality accumulation functions non executable tasks min 
tests need done ms represent wide range quality accumulation functions 
current practice adapted different task environment 
section demonstrate simple algorithm different current hospital scheduling practice significantly different new algorithm ancillary interrelationships low non existent 

generalized partial global planning gpgp gpgp domain independent scheduling coordination approach gpgp approach architectural assumptions 
important agent represents current set intended tasks ms task structure representation language :10.1.1.42.8231
task structures abstraction hierarchies leaves instantiated basic actions executable methods 
ms allows specification dynamically changing uncertain task characteristics effect agent preferences state world including tasks hard soft deadlines 
ms specification indicates relationships local non local tasks resources effect agent preference characteristics 
agent gpgp approach provides planner plan retriever create task structures attempt achieve agent goals scheduler attempts maximize utility choice temporal location basic actions task structure
