university florida technical report tr gainesville fl information integration wizard project problem statement report progress joachim hammer dept computer information science engineering university florida gainesville fl cise ufl edu integration heterogeneous data sources motivation research projects years :10.1.1.19.3770
paradigm shift centralized client server distributed systems multiple autonomous sources producing managing data created great demand data systems integration 
order combine information independently managed data sources integration systems need overcome discrepancies way source data maintained modeled queried 
aspects heterogeneity data sources due different hardware software platforms manage distributed databases 
emergence standard protocols middleware components corba dcom odbc jdbc simplified remote access standard source systems possible 
research initiatives integrating heterogeneous data sources focus overcoming schematic semantic discrepancies exist cooperative data sources assuming reliably efficiently accessed called integration systems protocols 
achieve goal established objectives develop new algorithms information integration considerably automated effective existing ones 
focus simplifying tasks removing structural semantic discrepancies merging related overlapping data 
propose carry research context xml representation language current web revolution opens exciting possibilities information sharing 
xml suitable hierarchical data structure graph common data representation model 
example goldman argue xml considered true data model specification define translate xml document data structures :10.1.1.22.605
demonstrate viability algorithms working prototype system data warehousing approach interoperation 
refer system integration wizard lets users access retrieve information heterogeneous sources knowledge underlying sources providing data 
representing research right goal prototype implementation build testbed analyzing algorithms provide opportunity students get hands experience working integration system
