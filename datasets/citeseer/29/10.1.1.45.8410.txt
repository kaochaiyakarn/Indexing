body rule right hand side symbol 
consists pattern representing sgml ii simple predicate eliminates oldest cars iii external functions extract city zip code input address 
head rule consists single pattern name parameterized variable sn representing name supplier 
parameterized pattern names correspond explicit skolem functions :10.1.1.38.6325
intuitively skolem states object created supplier name encountered input sgml 
supplier name appears twice input object created 
implies name supplier represents key 
case result transformation described rule non deterministic suppliers share name sn address yatl semantics specify value chosen sn
