major approaches dealing phenomenon vagueness conceived de dicto fashion approximation cohn gotts worboys bittner stell bittner stell appear fraassen fine varzi 
approximation redefinition names predicates refer 
names seen referring equivalence classes objects objects bittner stell 
predicates seen referring equivalence classes extensions single extension busse 
concentrate redefinition notion truth accommodate multiplicity candidate associated vague names predicates 
basic idea follows determining truth assertion containing vague name predicate need take account candidate referents extensions 
evaluate assertion effectively running candidates determining particular choice assertion true false 
assertion brunner bald true choices 
assertion bill clinton bald false choices 
problems arise regard sentences indeterminate sense come true choices false 
essence problem captured called paradox sorensen 
consider bill clinton 
certainly bald losing hair bald 
hold quite generally clinton bald loses hair bald 
chain reasoning start non bald clinton clinton bald hairs left head 
intuitively losing hair cause transition non bald bald

core theory granular partitions smith bittner smith appear 
extend core order take account fact projection granular partitions marked vagueness 
shall concentrate attention case singular concrete portions reality mountains 
conceive crisp projection dealt core theory granular partitions limit case vague projection manifested terms mount everest 
examples deal exclusively spatial advantage framework applies spatial case partitions general 
theory vagueness automatically generalized spatial case 

judgments context pointed redefinition notion truth accommodate multiplicity possible referents 
draws recognition sentence assigned determinate truth value independently referents constituent singular terms predicates precisely specified means independently restrict just portions reality candidate 
sentence called true false 
hand true ways false said fall truth value gap 
technique applied names sentences treated syntactic objects 
smith point degree type vagueness singular terms affected varies significant ways contexts terms 
argue method necessary theory conceiving semantic evaluations applied sentences judgments sentences express 
judgments terms projected reality subjects 
sentence may different contexts express distinct judgments singular terms involved refer intuitively parcel reality 
judgments look different sentences question syntactic objects smith 
context dependence vagueness important consequences 
easy construct examples sentences sentences treated context philosophical literature vagueness devoted discussion examples sort easy find examples sentences confine assertions naturally arise specific types contexts inhabit 
features difficult judgments occur marked indeterminacy 
consider example sentence cavity part mount everest uttered pointing small cave near surface mountain 
certainly referents mount everest sentence come true come false 
sentence comes true example allow mount everest defined spatially example means rule say effect sufficient condition part mount everest occupies spatial location lies convex hull mountain depicted relief maps 
sentence comes false hand conform rule effect part mountain certain minimal size rock rules parts unity conditions discussed section 
different sorts rules determining allowable operation different sorts contexts 
imagine example sentence uttered planning exploration cave summit mount everest 
cave certainly part mount everest uses rule matter course 
fact cave filled air context critical filled rock cave 
uses express judgment specific context resultant judgment evaluated true possible consistent context 
consider hand analyzing probes collected drilling holes rock 
rule operation portions mount everest constituted rock case 
factor play factor syntax semantics pragmatics judgment 
negation cavity part mount everest geological context just everyday contexts 
feature special example contexts comes 
compare sentence hole part jacket 
everyday contexts 
example hole design feature jacket comes 
consider example glass empty contrast behavior sentence distinct contexts 
context express judgment bar just sip beer glass 
second context truth denied hygiene inspector inspecting glass just seconds 
distinct judgments 
glass contains left drink 
hygiene inspector sees bacteria inside glass consistent sees sentence evaluated true 
judgments repeat contexts 
evaluate judgment truth falsehood ought evaluate judgment context 
judgment true contextually appropriate ways putting members pertinent extensions corresponding terms analogously 
sentence context context reach point serve proper object semantic evaluation 
sentence context indeterminate truth value 
question shall deal follows 
term context course notoriously problematic 
primary advantage proposal lies fact theory granular partitions serve formally tractable surrogate notion context enables rephrase question way avoids notion 

granular partitions judgment brings granular partition reality 
clear discussion sentence hygiene inspector sees world finer grid happy 
distinct partitions reality effected judgments level granularity 
ontological zooming coarser finer partitions ontological regrouping move distinct partitions level granularity 
singular term effects partition reality foreground domain object located background domain entities 
note results partition understood simple mereological lines 
say connected compact hole free portion reality set relief relation surroundings surroundings identifiable mereological complement 
object included foreground domain imply parts object included 
meant say partitions granular recognize parts beneath certain size 
reason granular partition compatible range possible views ultimate constituents objects included respective cells 
granularity partitions allows ignore questions lower level constituents objects uses singular terms granularity responsible vagueness terms concepts
