efficient goal directed bottom evaluation logic programs michael department mathematics computer science ben university beer israel cs ac il introduces new strategy efficient goal directed bottomup evaluation logic programs 
combining standard bottomup evaluation strategy magic set transformation evaluation strategy specialized application magic set programs characterized clause bodies high degree overlapping 
approach similar techniques avoid re computation maintaining reusing partial solutions clause bodies 
overhead considerably reduced maintained implicitly underlying prolog implementation 
technique simple meta interpreter goal directed bottom evaluation 
magic set transformation involved dependencies calls answers expressed directly interpreter
