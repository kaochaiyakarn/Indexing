incremental relevance feedback information filtering james allan allan cs umass edu center intelligent information retrieval department computer science university massachusetts amherst ma usa data trec routing experiments explore relevance feedback applied incrementally judged documents time achieve results feedback occurred pass 
show relatively judgments needed get highquality results 
demonstrate methods reduce amount information archived past judged documents adversely affecting effectiveness 
novel simulation shows techniques useful handling long standing queries drifting notions relevance 
information filter monitors stream documents selects match query 
information filtering differs traditional information retrieval respects documents arrive continuously residing collection query long lived shot exist days weeks years matching process requires decision ranked list 
section demonstrates incremental approach successfully cope query drift section summarizes results presents open questions 
incremental feedback 
information filters documents arrive continuously number documents arriving time may vary 
retrieval system monitors stream documents finds matches user query document saved 
part retrieval problem handled various existing filtering engines research community sift cal commercial setting :10.1.1.36.4424
documents selected user reads opportunity mark relevant 
judgments combined query generate new query judgments 
new query monitor flow incoming documents 
cycle continues query longer needed 
top terms ranking re ranked rocchio formula rocchio rel gamma wx weight term query relevant documents non relevant documents 
weight term relevant set calculated follows bel bel delta delta idf tf tf len idf log log tf number times term occurs document len length document average length documents collection number documents collection number documents contain term formula belief function currently inquery abc weights non relevant documents query calculated similarly 
terms ranked rocchio weight added query original information filtering setting notion collection awkward 
experiments training database collection 
practice collection data built time cal recall pt recall precision graph feedback full subset run orig subset full base cases incremental feedback showing feedback helps substantially original queries :10.1.1.36.4424
shows subset judgments subset works quite compared full set 
query terms included new query 
user supplied query terms generally reliable automatically generated ones new terms weighted slightly multiplying 
note feedback scheme best known approach
