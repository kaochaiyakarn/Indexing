supporting containment queries relational database management systems chun zhang jeffrey naughton david dewitt luo department computer sciences university wisconsin madison naughton dewitt cs wisc edu virtually proposals querying xml include class query term containment queries 
clear foreseeable substantial amount xml data stored relational database systems 
raises question support containment queries 
inverted list technology underlies information retrieval suited queries implement technology separate loosely coupled ir engine native tables query execution machinery rdbms 
option years rdbms query optimization query execution scalability concurrency control recovery immediately extend queries structures implement new operations 
irrelevant performance option lags 
performance study shows rdbmss generally poorly suited queries certain conditions outperform inverted list engine 
analysis identifies significant causes differentiate performance ir rdbms implementations join algorithms employed hardware cache utilization 
results suggest contrary expectations modifications native implementation rdbms support class query efficiently
