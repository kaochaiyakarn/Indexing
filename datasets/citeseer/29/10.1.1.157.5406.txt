team member maintains copy team state subteam states subteams participates 
shared memory team members 
second key aspect teamwork isis novel approach coordination communication general purpose teamwork model 
particular uncertainties arise dynamic environments maintain coherence teamwork team members provided capability highly exible coordination communication 
generalpurpose explicit models teamwork proposed promising approach enhance teamwork exibility :10.1.1.102.5130:10.1.1.36.6876
essentially teamwork models provide agents capability rst principles reasoning teamwork provide teamwork exibility 
models enable code reuse

result enables team members autonomously reason coordination communication improving teamwork exibility 
furthermore due steam demonstrated reusable domains 
steam uses formal joint intentions framework basic building block uenced sharedplans theory includes key enhancements re ect constraints real world domains
