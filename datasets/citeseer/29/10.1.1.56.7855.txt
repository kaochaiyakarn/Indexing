objectoriented graph data model oql graph query language goql 
data model language illustrated application domain multimedia presentation graphs 
discuss query processing techniques goql specifically translation goql language called algebra extended operators deal paths sequences 
discuss different approaches efficient implementations algebra operators paths sequences 
database applications hypertext applications geographic information systems world wide web searching heterogeneous information integration require modeling querying graph data memm bdhs am 
oql goql uses traditional select statement querying 
goql extends oql express relationships node objects edge objects path objects graph objects construction querying manipulation objects 
feature goql capability querying sequences paths special cases sequences 
addition sequence operators oql goql uses temporal operators connected querying paths sequences queries involving relative ordering sequence elements supported 
processing goql queries translated operator language algebra extended new operators :10.1.1.51.2544
algebra object algebra designed processing object oriented database oodb queries 
algebra offers small set operators similar counterparts extended relational algebra 
operands algebra sets objects uniform structure object consists oid tuple level nesting 
processing front objects mapped internal type objects 
give brief overview algebra elaborate algebra operators extended dealing paths sequences show transformation examples 
algebra algebra object algebra simple operands designed processing objectoriented database oodb queries 
algebra operands sets objects uniform structure object consists oid tuple level nesting arbitrary complex values allowed tuple attribute 
transform oql queries algebra expressions front bulk data type objects mapped internal type objects level nesting 
algebra operators defined algebra divided groups :10.1.1.51.2544
group operators similar defined relational algebra select oe cartesian product theta project union difference gamma rename difference operators select assign new oids result tuples 
example oid get oid oid sg 
object rename creates new object property tuple property tuple different object oid resulting named algebra group ff handling complex objects similar nest unnest extended relational algebra 
third group operators map remap relate oid attribute values 
map core algebra operator remap expressed core algebra operators 
scalar type remap map oe bulk data type remap operation result map 
ra oid get oid oid ag 
due uniformity operands simplicity operators small powerful set algebraic laws obtained crucial building powerful optimizer having small algebraic rewriting search space 
general procedure convert oql queries algebra expressions :10.1.1.51.2544
