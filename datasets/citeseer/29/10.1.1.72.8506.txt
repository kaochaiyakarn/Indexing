new cost model nearest bor search high dimensional data space 
analyze different nearest neighbor algorithms tion algorithm originally proposed quadtrees show algorithm optimal develop cost model contrast previous models takes boundary effects account works high dimensions 
advantages model particular model works data sets number dimensions arbitrary number data points applicable different data distributions provides accurate estimates expected query execution time 
show practical relevance ac model perform detailed analysis synthetic real data 
results applying model tree indices show provides estimation query performance considerably bet ter estimates previous models especially highdimensional data 
key words nearest neighbor search cost model searching multidimensional index structures high dimensional data space
