agencies organizations need publish microdata medical data census data research purposes 
typically data stored table record row corresponds individual 
record number attributes divided categories 
attributes clearly identify individuals 
known explicit identifiers include social security number address name 
attributes values taken potentially identify individual 
known quasi identifiers may include zip code birthdate gender 
attributes considered sensitive disease salary 
releasing microdata necessary prevent sensitive information individuals disclosed 
types information disclosure identified literature identity disclosure attribute disclosure 
identity disclosure occurs individual linked particular record released table 
attribute disclosure occurs new information individuals revealed released data possible infer characteristics individual accurately possible data release 
identity disclosure leads attribute disclosure 
identity disclosure individual re identified corresponding sensitive values revealed 
attribute disclosure occur identity disclosure 
recognized disclosure false attribute information may cause harm 
observer released table may incorrectly perceive individual sensitive attribute takes particular value behave accordingly perception 
harm individual perception incorrect 
released table gives useful information researchers presents disclosure risk individuals data table

limitations diversity diversity principle represents important step anonymity protecting attribute disclosure shortcomings discuss 
diversity may difficult unnecessary achieve 
example suppose original data sensitive attribute test result particular virus 
takes values positive negative 
suppose records negative positive 
values different degrees sensitivity 
mind known tested negative population want known considered tested positive 
case diversity unnecessary equivalence class contains records negative 
order distinct diverse table equivalence classes information loss large 
observe entropy sensitive attribute table small uses entropy diversity set small value 
diversity insufficient prevent attribute disclosure 
attacks diversity 
skewness attack distribution skewed satisfying diversity prevent attribute disclosure 
consider example 
suppose equivalence class equal number positive records negative records 
satisfies distinct diversity entropy diversity recursive diversity requirement imposed 
presents serious privacy risk class considered possibility positive compared population 
consider equivalence class positive records negative record 
distinct diverse higher entropy table satisfies entropy diversity impose equivalence class considered positive percent 
fact equivalence class exactly diversity class positive negative records classes levels privacy risks 
similarity attack sensitive attribute values equivalence class distinct semantically similar adversary learn important information 
consider example 
example table original table table shows anonymized version satisfying distinct entropy diversity

diversity requirement motivated limiting difference indirectly requiring level diversity 
choose limit difference 
words assume distribution sensitive attribute population table public information 
limit observer information gain population limit extent observer learn additional information specific individuals 
justify assumption treated public information observe generalizations generalize quasi identifier attributes general value 
long version data released distribution released
