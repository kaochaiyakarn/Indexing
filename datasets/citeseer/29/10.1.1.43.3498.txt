algorithms organize collections kazman kleinberg build collections issuing query search engine augmenting results pages link linked page original set results :10.1.1.120.3875
kazman argue page connectivity crucial resource organizing collections judging page quality 
system sorts pages equivalence classes total degree number pages collection connected displays pages layout series concentric circles containing pages equal degree kleinberg defines algorithms identify authoritative hub pages hypertext 
authorities hubs mutually dependent authority page linked hubs hub links authorities 
equilibrium algorithm identify hubs authorities hypertext collection
