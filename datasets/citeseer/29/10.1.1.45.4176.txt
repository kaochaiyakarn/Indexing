effective control cooperative problem solving requires local control decisions influenced state problem solving agents 
influence call cooperative control 
extreme cooperative control mechanisms tightly integrated local control boundary local cooperative control difficult assess 
extreme cooperative control operates outside asynchronously local control mechanisms 
interface local control establishment high level policies local control implements :10.1.1.48.8362
case local control clearly distinguishable cooperative control certain amount latitude decisions local information may direct knowledge state agents problem solving 
cooperative control involves dynamic allocation subproblems agents ongoing requirements problem solving availability hardware resources 
discussions point assumed partition subproblems task decomposition organizational structure agents fixed depending priori distribution expertise information sensors effectors communication processing resources 
fact choices available partitioning especially choices involving subproblems solved access large amounts raw data specialized expertise resides limited number agents 
agents totally coherent behavior situation approach worthwhile 
principle important situations accurate control permits significant reductions amount communication processing required implement cooperative control algorithms 
second principle effective cooperative control follows sophisticated local control 
agents able represent reason local problem solving activities accommodate problem solving requirements agents
