evaluation measures information retrieval systems generally evaluated basis ranked recall precision numerous measures proposed information filtering systems evaluated wider range measures including set measures various utility measures particular measure settled preferred tdt setting chosen measure system effectiveness primarily false negative false alarm false positive fallout rates 
major reason choosing perception problem detection task ranking task system needs indicate story new event tracked provide ranked list stories discuss event 
unfortunately fairly straightforward systems generate ranked lists stories provide score creates ranking difficult determine score threshold 
examples indicate system unable detect certain events discussed news different levels granularity 
hypothesize problems revealed failure analysis resolved different weight assignment strategy query features 
event tracking tdt evaluation approach different established trec filtering task 
provides large amount training data queries relevance judgments requires sites generate filtering queries test set provided 
trec filtering track training data includes relevant documents mean routing track relevant documents mean :10.1.1.55.8840
settings training information possible difficult argue setting commonplace 
event tracking task hand interested substantially smaller numbers training stories fact interested stories needed successful tracking 
important problem task model real world setting tracking needs soon possible training stories 
consider case tracking bombing event interesting evaluate tracking system news reported weeks event goal system tracking immediately 
performance similar values larger queries generally effective optimal values appear features 
suspect small number features sufficient news reporting tends refer event words phrases relying audience having context recognize event capturing features sufficient track event high accuracy

idea form unsupervised learning incremental nature similar notion feedback proved highly successful trec workshops tracking query created training stories threshold :10.1.1.55.8840

adaptive approach highly successful generating superior queries particularly low false alarm rates

smaller thresholds cause performance get consistently worse adding stories relevant 
preliminary studies retrospective detection task tdt pilot study support intuition :10.1.1.1.4610
nice features adaptive tracking works allows system operate effectively fewer sample stories 
suggests sample stories sufficient achieve high quality tracking adding causes improvement effect achieved adapting
