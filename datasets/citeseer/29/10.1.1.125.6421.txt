cascade correlation learning architecture scott fahlman christian lebiere august cmu cs school computer science carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa cascade correlation new architecture supervised learning algorithm artificial neural networks 
just adjusting weights network fixed topology cascade correlation begins minimal network automatically trains adds new hidden units creating multi layer structure 
new hidden unit added network input side weights frozen 
unit permanent feature detector network available producing outputs creating complex feature detectors 
cascade correlation architecture advantages existing algorithms learns quickly network determines size topology retains structures built training set changes requires back propagation error signals connections network
