research activity intelligent agent community mid late focussed problem designing agents achieve effective balance deliberation process deciding means ends reasoning process deciding :10.1.1.55.3666
particularly successful approach emerged time belief desire intention bdi paradigm 
development bdi paradigm great extent driven bratman theory human practical reasoning intentions play central role 
put crudely agent deliberate indefinitely courses action pursue idea eventually commit achieving certain states affairs devote resources achieving 
chosen states affairs intentions adopted play central role practical reasoning

case meta level control deliberation components sub optimal agent wasted time deliberating modified intentions despite fact reason 
discussion extract simple principle task environments wasted effort meta level control function choose deliberate corresponding deliberation function change focus 
say meta level control function sound respect optimal deliberation function iff chooses deliberate chooses change focus implies 
similarly say complete respect iff change focus chooses deliberate implies 
successful strategy cost meta level control function approximately equal cost deliberation cost cost 
pointed earlier require cost meta level control significantly deliberation cost cost
