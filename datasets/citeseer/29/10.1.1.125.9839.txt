prediction system multimedia pre fetching internet zhong su department computer science university beijing china bj com rapid development interact resulted multimedia web content 
due limitation bandwidth huge size multimedia data users suffer long time waiting 
hand predict web object page user view user viewing current page pre fetch content perceived network latency significantly reduced 
gram model utilize path profiles users large web log predict users requests 
model simple extension existing point models predictions results show sacrificing applicability somewhat gain great deal prediction precision 
efficient method compress prediction model size fitted main memory 
popular way predict url url 
regarded markov model graph 
current node probability access nodes list known urls 
may require knowledge context web page 
examples webwatcher system system :10.1.1.31.3135
pre sending systems go step focus making predictions send documents ahead time 
accurate prediction potentially shorten users access times reduce network traffic pre sending handled correctly 
prediction models point path 
point draw relatively small amount information session prediction potentially inaccurate 
combined approach multiple high order gram models organized step wise manner 
experiments show performed author visiting microsoft research china beijing 
approach achieves reasonable balance precision applicability 
provide efficient method reduce model size 
assumes knowledge user profiles ones required syskill webert knowledge linkage structures web sites required webwatcher :10.1.1.40.4469
requirement user sessions web access logged successfully requirement realistic apply wide range multimedia applications
