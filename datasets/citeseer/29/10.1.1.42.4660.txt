unsupervised learning probabilistic models robot navigation koenig reid simmons school computer science carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa navigation methods office delivery robots need take various sources uncertainty account order get robust performance 
previous developed reliable navigation technique uses partially observable markov models represent metric actuator sensor uncertainties 
describes algorithm adjusts probabilities model passively observing robot interactions environment 
learned probabilities accurately reflect actual uncertainties environment ultimately leads improved navigation performance 
algorithm extension baum welch algorithm learns teacher addresses issues limited memory cost collecting training data 
empirical results show algorithm learns markov models small amount training data
