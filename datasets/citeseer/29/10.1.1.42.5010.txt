discuss tradeoffs involved control complex articulated agents implemented controllers complex task physically humanoid torso dancing 
controllers drawn animation biological models robotics illustrate issues joint space vs cartesian space task specification implementation 
mussa ivaldi related rats suggests existence force field motor primitives converge single equilibrium points produce high level behaviors reaching 
particular field activated frog leg executes behavior comes rest position corresponds equilibrium point fields activated linear superposition fields obtained fields dominates mussa ivaldi 
suggests elegant organizational principle motor control entire behaviors coded low level force fields may combined higher level complex behaviors 
idea supplying agent collection basis behaviors primitives representing force fields combining general repertoire complex motion appealing 
previous matari matari inspired biological results successfully applied idea basis behaviors control planar mobile agents robots :10.1.1.42.323:10.1.1.41.5055

inspiration comes psychophysical data describing people observing human movement 
continuing combination approach controller implementations involve unavoidable tradeoffs uses single consistent approach generating movement 
different frames appear simplest task specifications resulting unnatural challenging transformations specification implementation 
stand point user appearance final synthesized behavior preferable means flexibly combining different control alternatives utilize approach suited task sub task 
currently working developing just approach control 
approach implemented behavior framework matari brooks uses behaviors abstractions encapsulating low level control details primitive :10.1.1.41.5055
consequently implement generic primitives get posture go point parameterize specific goals sub task assigned 
benefits behavior decomposition different ways structuring system different types controllers behavior decomposition achieved specific behavior controllers vary depending available sensors effectors 
example get posture implemented different types joint space controllers analogously go point different cartesian controllers desired 
furthermore behavior types added oscillator primitives movements bouncing waving swinging williamson 
sub tasks assigned different types controllers pd servo joint space control posture related sub tasks sub tasks impedance cartesian control extrinsic body centered movements sub tasks 
implementation executed sub task sequentially eliminating interference different controllers 
sequencing behaviors primitives activated executed parallel 
example implementation included avoid collisions primitive executed concurrently get posture go point primitive order generate safe movement 
concurrent behavior combination complex sequencing requires consistent output representations controllers combined matari :10.1.1.41.5055
different types primitives assumes user intelligent automated method subdivide task sub tasks assign appropriate types behaviors primitives 
believe unreasonable assumptions 
human generated specifications typically sequential step wise fashion 
sub task breaks generated directly observing movement example zero velocity breaks point
