important problems studied ai representing reasoning action change 
earliest attempts formalize problem straightforward encoding actions effects fraught difficulty 
roughly description state world action want ability predict new state action performed 
unfortunately natural inclination specify actions terms facts change leave things unaffected logical systems tolerant implicit assumptions 
frame problem action representation actions specified compact natural way reasoning system fill blanks treat facts unchanging :10.1.1.85.5082
number solutions proposed literature including nonmonotonic formalisms embodying default assumption facts persist 
principle minimization change allows infer facts explicitly mentioned affected action unaffected 
shown hanks mcdermott anomalous behavior results principle applied straightforward way 
subsequent attempts deal problems nonmonotonic logics proven somewhat successful judicious application principle 
solutions shown suffer problems see 
isolating frame problem adopted clearer perspective problem 
frame problem representation clear precise representational methodology tightly coupled reasoning mechanism put forth 
furthermore clearly identify nature problem solved 
minimization change proposed deal theories aspects frame problem qualification problem ramification problem actions defeasible effects forth 
successful resolution problems requires isolated conceptually solutions studied independently 
single mechanism settle score problem viewed happy coincidence taken assumption investigations start 
perspective led increased emphasis representation actions solutions shown correct respect restricted classes action theories 
particular approach fits mold model reiter suggests syntactic transformation completes action theories particular syntactic form 
isolating different aspects reasoning action proven fruitful major question facing piecemeal approach scaling solutions fare additional features added theories action willing entertain 
examine complicating factor nondeterministic actions propose solution spirit reiter mechanism deterministic actions 
nondeterministic actions actions flipping coin may lead possible outcomes 
actions inherently unpredictable outcomes priori possible 
example predict flipping coin result heads tails 
reiter approach expressed framework situation calculus sc restricted dealing deterministic actions possible outcome result 
furthermore main intuitions underlying reiter approach directly applicable nondeterministic contexts 
precisely reiter method identifies atomic proposition conditions change asserts conditions change 
straightforward generalization nondeterministic setting suggests examine proposition conditions change heads change flip state conditions 
unfortunately method fails due presence correlations action effects 
example action force forcing door possible outcomes door closed happens door remains closed door opens triggering alarm door opens triggers alarm 
examine possible outcomes note open true false force similarly alarm course relative level detail willing model 
true false 
separation effects suggest possible outcomes force 
alarm open possible due correlation alarm open

note semantics observations different primarily presence nondeterministic actions

important contrast definite specification indefinite action description logical perspective requirement true performing fulfilled ways literals fixed 
possible ways achieving effect area persist anda consider nondeterministic models classes models corresponding nonempty subsets choices match specification deterministic 
distinction nondeterminism indefinite action specification important nondeterminism corresponds inherent uncertainty outcomes action level detail willing model indefinite specifications denote certain ignorance outcomes 
distinction introduce representational tools mpl capture treatment nondeterministic actions clear 
view frame problem completing specification known system dynamics 
allows adopt convention known effects action need specified aspects treated unchanging 
action descriptions definite nondeterministic possible action outcomes known indefinite descriptions fix possible outcomes weaker predictions result

resolution ignorance action outcomes problem separate frame problem 
attempts represent nondeterministic actions indefinite specifications disjunctions forced choice transitions possible
