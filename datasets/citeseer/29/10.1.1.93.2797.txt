fourier descriptors plane closed curves charles ralph method analysis synthesis closed curves plane developed fourier descriptors curve represented function arc length accumulated change direction curve starting point 
function expanded fourier series coefficients arranged amplitude phase angle form 
shown amplitudes pure form invariants certain simple functions phase angles 
rotational axial symmetry related directly simple properties fourier descriptors 
analysis shape similarity symmetry relationships closed symmetric curves synthesized arbitrary fourier descriptors 
fourier series expansion optimal unique respect obtaining insensitive starting point
