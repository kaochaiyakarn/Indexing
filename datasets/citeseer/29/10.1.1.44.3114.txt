filtering task agent involves judging article relevant irrelevant user user profile environment prior probability encountering relevant document low compared probability encountering irrelevant document 
environment frustrating time consuming user interact agent starts knowledge obtain set positive negative examples user feedback 
user browses want evaluate web pages contain potentially interesting information 
words set continue expand keywords stock share choosing 
relevance feedback important ways current information retrieval technology supports refining searches relevance feedback 
relevance feedback process users identify relevant documents initial list retrieved documents system creates new query sample relevant documents 
idea newly formed query documents similar desired relevant documents returned documents similar 
central problems relevance feedback selecting features words phrases relevant documents calculating weights features context new query :10.1.1.92.3553
