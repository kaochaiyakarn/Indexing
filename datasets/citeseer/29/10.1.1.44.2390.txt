capturing database dynamics deferred updates carl alexander burkhard freitag universitat passau fur mathematik und informatik passau germany mail uni passau de tel fax universitat passau technical report mip field logic databases static semantics evaluation queries understood 
consensus appropriate treatment dynamic behaviour evolution database time 
various methods incorporate update constructs logic databases proposed 
address explicit construction complex update programs basic update operations insert tuple delete tuple 
main contribution definition logical semantics sets deferred update requests 
propose logic language allows express concurrent sequential composition update operations set oriented updates bulk updates 
note sequential composition requires second subgoal refers hypothetical state caused consume wine number gets empty ordered 
worth mentioning running example stratified bulk quantification 
interior goal order bulk quantifier defining rule order depend recursively order 
semantics different semantics normal programs 
presently commonly accepted semantics subsumed founded model semantics vgrs :10.1.1.121.6788
rest assume semantics 
transaction logic bk bk semantics update formulae tied particular idb semantics chosen 
interpretation update formulae semantics concept deferred updates 
essentially means updates immediately executed encountered 
implications hold gammar delta db phi delta gammar delta db gammar delta delta gammar delta db gammar delta gammar delta delta gammar delta delta statement contradicts precondition saying delta consistent 
assumption false assertion follows 
assertion proved similarly proof associativity phi lemma 
example edb instance db store update request set delta store 
execution delta yields edb instance db db db phi delta store definition founded model phi db idb union edb instance db set idb rules idb wfm phi denotes founded model see vgrs phi :10.1.1.121.6788
able deal valued models assume wfm phi represented set true false ground atoms prefix referring false atom 
definition semantics db literals db physical edb instance idb idb program 
define db interpretation db assigns delta founded model db delta wfm idb db phi delta recall terms interpreted usual herbrand pre interpretation 
define interpretation update formulae 
consider recursive iterative approach low level solution possibly generated transaction scheduler 
relational assignment operator copying idb relation edb proposed 
operation atomic outside scope transaction logic 
bulk updates composed existing single updates 
concurrent transaction logic bk provides explicit concurrency construct specify subtransactions performed interleaving fashion :10.1.1.34.4057
form concurrency requires stronger form compatibility assertion implicit concurrency concept 
approach goal operate state may assumed consistent produce specific increments interleaving semantics transaction logic goals concurrently manipulate global database state 
leads non determinism verification problems concurrent programming languages 
datalog attempt perform bulk updates aggregation success paths resolution tree query 
contrast special rules explicitly describe update operations evaluation abductive flavour 
proposed mw suitable rules performing view updates generated framework 
setting possibility expressing non deterministic update operations useful 
approaches dealing updates deductive databases mentioned thom ramamohanarao show problems arise non declarative update constructs logic programming propose clean concept deferred updates
