prominent emerging approaches database programming build deductive object oriented paradigms 
objectoriented databases oodbs support rich facilities representing structural behavioural information normally associated computationally complete programming languages suitable range applications relational database systems inappropriate 
categories system weaknesses 
deductive databases lack expressive data structuring mechanisms normally support limited facilities update object oriented database systems rarely formal semantic models lack declarative query languages
