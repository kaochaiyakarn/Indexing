efficient distance computation non convex objects sean quinlan robotics laboratory computer science department stanford university describes efficient algorithm computing distance non convex objects 
objects modeled union set convex components 
model construct hierarchical bounding representation spheres 
distance objects determined computing distance pairs convex components preexisting techniques 
key efficiency simple search routine uses bounding representation ignore possible pairs components 
efficiency improved accepting relative error returned result
