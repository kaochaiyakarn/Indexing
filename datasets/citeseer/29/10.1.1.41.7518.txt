highly scalable metasearch engine weiyi meng clement yu wu department computer science state university new binghamton binghamton ny phone fax email meng cs binghamton edu department eecs university illinois chicago chicago il world wide web expanding fast rate 
coverage web major search engines steadily decreasing despite effort index web pages 
worse search engines get larger higher percentages indexed information obsolete 
people having doubt scalability centralized search engine technology 
scalable alternative search web metasearch engine approach 
metasearch engine considered interface top multiple local search engines provide uniform access local search engines 
objective performing database selection improve efficiency sending query potentially useful search engines network traffic cost searching useless databases reduced 
collection fusion problem retrieve documents selected databases merge documents objective listing useful documents ahead useless documents 
various heterogeneities multiple search engines difficult achieve fusion 
metasearch engine retrieval effectiveness close documents single database minimizing access cost 
substantial body research addressing different aspects building effective efficient metasearch engine accumulated years :10.1.1.31.1173:10.1.1.50.4709:10.1.1.56.6170:10.1.1.21.2535:10.1.1.103.1339
existing systems consider small scale metasearch engines local search engines 
approaches scale tens thousands local search engines time achieve effectiveness 
reason follows 
existing methods order perform database selection detailed representative database needs stored metasearch engine indicate contents database 
detailed representative database may roughly size database 
tens thousands local databases representatives may total size times typical database 
prepared working group resource discovery database selection asserted potentially repositories web today called development highly scalable methods resource discovery 
propose new approach perform database selection collection fusion 
method uses framework developed ranking databases optimally similarity similar document local database see section information :10.1.1.39.1707:10.1.1.50.4709
main contribution development experiment new technique rank databases 
technique novel database representative features 
highly scalable 
fact scale virtually unlimited number local databases 
similarity function normalization known cosine function 
sake concreteness shall version cosine function query uses product inverse document frequency weight term frequency weight document uses term frequency weight 
inverse document frequency weight term computed global document frequency term number documents containing term databases computed similarities global similarities 
section review framework database selection collection fusion 
framework introduced :10.1.1.39.1707:10.1.1.50.4709
suppose user interested retrieving similar documents query databases dn framework summarized definition optimal database ranking theorem necessary sufficient condition ranking databases optimally algorithm integrated database selection collection fusion ranked databases 
definition set databases said optimally ranked order dn respect query positive integer exists contain similar documents contains similar documents 
intuitively ordering optimal similar documents query desired sufficient examine databases 
note ordering databases depends query ease presentation shall assume similarities documents query distinct set similar documents query unique 
proposition databases dn optimally ranked order dn respect query msim msim msim dn msim global similarity similar document database query note proposition holds similarity function function assigns degrees relevance documents respect query 
example function assigns degree relevance document similarity query importance due link structure web environment see section optimal arrangement databases descending order relevant document database remains true 
example consider databases suppose global similarities similar documents databases query respectively 
databases ranked order query 
optimal order databases algorithm known optdocretrv developed perform database selection collection fusion :10.1.1.39.1707
algorithm sketched follows 
suppose databases selected initially 
selected search engines returns actual global similarity similar document metasearch engine computes minimum values 
search engines returns metasearch engine documents global similarities greater equal minimum value 
shown databases ranked optimally algorithm optdocretrv guarantee retrieval desired documents 
order apply framework practice problems solved 
obtain documents local database global similarities query greater equal threshold 
note local search engines retrieve documents local similarity functions term statistics may result local similarity document different global similarity document 
problem addressed discussed :10.1.1.50.4709
second problem estimate global similarity similar document respect query local database proposition applied 
estimation method problem proposed 
method needs separate database representative local database representative contains pieces statistical information term local database 
addition estimation method exponential time complexity terms number terms query 
integrated representative databases order compute ranking score database respect query adjusted maximum normalized weight term database needs stored 
follow example existing approaches create separate database representative database stores metasearch engine 
case representative database contain terms adjusted maximum normalized weight term query received metasearch engine query information representative database compute ranking score database 
databases ranked algorithm optdocretrv reviewed section select databases retrieve documents 
database representative stores piece information term scalable existing database selection approaches terms storage space required :10.1.1.31.1173
metasearch engines hundreds local databases probably afford separate representative database store metasearch engine 
goal create metasearch engine may hundreds thousands local search engines entire web potentially searched metasearch engine feasible separate representative search engine
