parameter genetic algorithm harik high school way mountain view ca net fernando lobo dept environmental engineering universidade nova de lisboa monte da portugal mail fct unl pt user point view setting parameters genetic algorithm ga far trivial task 
user typically interested population sizes crossover probabilities selection rates ga technicalities 
just interested solving problem really hand problem blackbox algorithm simply press start button 
explores development ga fulfills requirement 
parameters whatsoever 
development algorithm takes account aspects theory gas including previous research population sizing schema theorem building block mixing genetic drift
