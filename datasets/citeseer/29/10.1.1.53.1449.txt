hand tracking deformable model submitted second international conference automatic face gesture recognition tony heap david hogg school computer studies university leeds leeds ls jt uk 
scs leeds ac uk describe constructed deformable point distribution model human hand capturing training data semi automatically volume images physically model 
show attempted model tracking unmarked hand moving degrees freedom plus deformation real time single video camera 
course show improve weighted squares pose parameter approximation little computational cost 
note successes shortcomings system discuss improved 
motivations long need vision hand tracking system capable tracking movement degrees freedom dof articulation information whilst possible
