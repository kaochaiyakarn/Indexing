static dynamic information organization star clusters aslam daniela rus department computer science dartmouth college nh system static dynamic information organization show evaluations system trec data 
introduce line line star clustering algorithms information organization 
evaluation experiments show line star algorithm outperforms single link average link clustering algorithms 
star algorithm highly cient simple implement advocate tasks require clustering information organization browsing filtering routing topic tracking new topic detection 
modern information systems vast amounts data change dynamically 
consider example flow information arrives continuously news wires aggregated news organization cnn
