classroom provides rich setting number different forms communication exist speech writing projected images 
information lecture poorly recorded lost currently 
hypothesis tools aid capture subsequent access classroom information enhance learning teaching experience 
test hypothesis initiated classroom project georgia tech 
purpose project apply ubiquitous computing technology facilitate automatic capture integration access multimedia information educational setting university classroom 
wanted provide students electronic notebook capability take notes class basis review class 
prototype developed parc prototype developed hewlett packard labs came close wanted hands students 
provided simple mechanism producing notes pen interface created automatic indexing video stream 
pen pc capture electronic annotations served indices digital audio stream 
investigated solutions similar done :10.1.1.31.5532
implicit connection note device alternate information streams audio video common theme explored mit media lab apple 
far ability connect liveboard remote information sources student notebooks class done dolphin project similar efforts 
availability ubiquitous information technologies world wide web universities able provide students access vast repositories educational materials 
quickly norm individual courses universities web page serves central clearing house course documentation 
main problem discussion class follow outline closely 
note taker wanted thought hard determine entry outline choose annotation 
choice entry entirely arbitrary resulting enhanced web page looked somewhat confusing 
quarter progressed altered application removing outline allowing user bring blank time stamped note pages writing came mind 
simpler interface similar spirit audio notebook confusing user class times :10.1.1.31.5532
developer insights year experience developing number classroom prototypes resulted valuable lessons insights ubiquitous computing application educational setting 
share significant ones 
go live mentioned best way understand effect ubiquitous technology everyday lives experience 
similar moran notion evolutionary engagement evolution tool informed early adoption real life context 
value pen interfaces debated merits pen interfaces focused pen interfaces exclusion input mechanisms 
advantages pen keyboard student notes electronic device 
familiar cheaper robust higher resolution current generation pen computers 
conventions taught note takers support time introducing added burden chance errors capture 
shortcoming removed vision technology demonstrated digitaldesk anchoring digitizing tablet similar prototype developed :10.1.1.31.5532
students noted type faster write typed information immediately available content search mechanisms 
stayed away keyboards felt constant tapping keys distraction class 
feel purpose classroom enable student take notes efficient note takers 
electronic whiteboard universally favored classroom liveboard provided excellent albeit expensive solution
