similarity metric learning variable kernel classifier david lowe computer science department university british columbia vancouver canada mail lowe cs ubc ca november nearest neighbour interpolation algorithms useful properties applications learning exhibit poor generalization 
shown better generalization obtained variable interpolation kernel combination conjugate gradient optimization similarity metric kernel size 
resulting method called variable kernel similarity metric vsm learning 
tested standard classification data sets problems shows better generalization back propagation learning methods 
important advantage system operate black box model minimization parameters need experimentally set user 
number parameters determined optimization orders magnitude back propagation rbf networks may indicate method better captures essential degrees variation learning
