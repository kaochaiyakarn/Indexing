presentation focussed case classification specific respect general 
core specific driven investigations learning general nonstandard concepts developed importance case reasoning general 
restricted view similarity basic drawbacks research case reasoning 
rigorous criticism intended set stage new approaches similarity may contribute considerable progress similarity cases 
new generation approaches similarity allow non symmetric similarity concepts similarity objects 
problems illustrate necessity abandon symmetry similarity concepts 
flexible approaches motivated introduced chapter particularly emphasizing problem non symmetry 
doing problem considered usually scope similarity approaches global knowledge represented collection cases rarely reflected comparing cases pairwise 
standard approach case classification cf 
aha aka collection typical algorithms collect number cases case base :10.1.1.138.635
new case classified searching similar case inside case base classifying new accordingly 
standard approach restricts power case classification considerably 
typical problems require different view similarity related sets texts representing text patterns see ang related learning problems characteristics particular new case recognized comparing couple cases simultaneously 
motivates lifting similarity local global concept
