parallel system equipped called shared virtual memory suited design implementation parallel spatial join algorithms 
start algorithm consists phases task creation task assignment parallel task execution 
order reduce cpu cost phases processed fashion preserves spatial locality 
dynamic load balancing achieved splitting tasks smaller ones smaller tasks idle processors
