multiagent reinforcement learning theoretical framework algorithm adopt general sum stochastic games framework multiagent reinforcement learning 
extends previous littman zero sum stochastic games broader framework 
design multiagent learning method framework prove converges nash equilibrium speci ed conditions 
algorithm useful nding optimal strategy exists unique nash equilibrium game 
exist multiple nash equilibria game algorithm combined learning techniques nd optimal strategies 
reinforcement learning gained attention extensive study years
