extensions object oriented methodologies advantages approach reasons cited justify approach extending object oriented methodologies 
firstly similarities object oriented paradigm agentoriented paradigm :10.1.1.27.9180
early times distributed artificial intelligence dai close relationship dai object concurrent programming established 
stated shoham agents considered active objects objects mental state 
paradigms message passing communicating inheritance aggregation defining architecture 
main difference constrained type messages ao paradigm definition state agent beliefs desires intentions commitments possible advantage comes commonly usage object oriented languages implement agent systems considered natural framework 
take advantage experience learning quicker 
common views system object oriented methodologies interesting describing agents static object structure objects structural relationships dynamic describing object interactions functional describing data flow methods objects 
techniques object identification identifying agents cases classes responsibilities collaborations crc cards 
aspects addressed spite similarities objects agents obviously agents simply objects 
object oriented methodologies address different aspects :10.1.1.30.9420
firstly objects agents message passing communicate message passing objects just method invocation agents distinguish different types messages model messages frequently speech acts complex protocols negotiate 
addition agents analyse messages decide execute requested action 
difference consists agents characterised mental state object oriented methodologies define techniques modelling agents carry inferences planning process agents characterised social dimension 
procedures modelling social relationships agents defined 
communication model refines previous model describing detail contracts agents petri nets 
transactions agents modelled transaction diagrams describe relationship speech acts goals 
task model specifies task decomposition task diagrams 
universe discourse model concerns modelling content messages exchanged agents object oriented techniques 
formal approaches formal approaches tried bridge gap formal theories implementations :10.1.1.25.7267
formal agent theories agent specifications allow complete specification system :10.1.1.25.7267
formal methods easily scalable practice specially useful verifying analysing critical applications prototypes complex cooperating systems 
traditional formal languages providing elegant framework describing system different levels abstractions 
notion time suited specifying agent interactions
