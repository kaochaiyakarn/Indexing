skill acquisition human demonstration hidden markov model department engineering faculty engineering information technology australian national university canberra australia new approach skill acquisition assembly proposed 
assembly skill represented hybrid dynamic system discrete event controller models skill task level 
output discrete event controller provides commands underlying robot controller 
structure naturally encoded hidden markov model hmm 
hmm parameters obtained training sensory data human demonstrations skill 
currently assembly tasks performed human operators robots expensive 
events correspond changes contact configurations detected process monitor 
discrete event controller provides commands parameters robot controller depending desired event 
consider skill consist discrete event controller process monitor 
focuses discrete event controller 
represent discrete event controller skill hidden markov model hmm :10.1.1.45.5793
states hidden markov model correspond states discrete event controller 
skill acquired human demonstration task observation symbols hmm taken variables recorded task performed human operator 
parameters hmm learned structure hmm data obtained human demonstration 
way hmm model data generated human operator performing task
