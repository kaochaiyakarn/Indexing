primary concern classifier learning prediction accuracy 
research shown committee ensemble learning techniques dietterich significantly increase prediction accuracy base classifier learning algorithms especially decision tree learning freund freund schapire quinlan breiman dietterich kong ali chan stolfo wolpert schapire freund bartlett lee bauer kohavi zheng webb :10.1.1.32.9399
committee learning induces multiple individual classifiers form committee repeated application single base learning algorithm 
classification stage committee members vote decide final classification 
decision tree learning quinlan studied classifier learning techniques 
widely kdd applications 
approaches dealing missing attribute values tree generation stage classification stage see quinlan 
addition webb addresses missing attribute value problem decision tree 
quinlan explains missing attribute values result classification differences decision tree committee merged tree derived combining trees committee

motivation research follows 
committee learning techniques dramatically reduce error 
observation obtained experiments domains containing small amount missing attribute values 
interesting know accuracy committee learning methods changes relative test sets contain missing attribute values 
bootstrap sample created uniformly sampling jdj instances replacement 
note tree ffl discarded tree ffl accepted committee 
weight instance trial computed equation 
weights sum exp gamma ff ff ln gamma ffl ffl correctly classifies 
bagging primary idea bagging breiman generate committee classifiers bootstrap sample original training set :10.1.1.32.9399
committee size training set consisting instances bag implementation bagging generates gamma bootstrap samples created uniformly sampling instances replacement

sasc key idea sasc vary members decision tree committee stochastic manipulation set attributes available selection decision nodes 
approaches voting 
categorical predictions provided trees voting weights 
case tree produces single predicted class example 
committee members vote predicting frequent class returned trees 
voting method corresponds method original bagging breiman :10.1.1.32.9399
