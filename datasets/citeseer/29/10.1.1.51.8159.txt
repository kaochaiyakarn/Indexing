information mediators need wrappers access web source structured database building wrappers hand impractical 
previous wrapper induction restrictive handle large number web pages contain tuples missing attributes multiple values variant attribute permutations exceptions 
simpler program wrapper hand semistructured web pages free text task trivial may require substantial programming techniques 
furthermore web pages change frequently
