investigate case representability case learnability indexed families uniformly recursive languages 
mainly interested case learning respect arbitrary fixed similarity measure case learnability indexed family requires representability 
show indexed family case representable positive negative cases 
positive cases allowed class representable families comparatively small 
furthermore results provide bounds concerning necessary size case bases 
furthermore elaborate relations gold style language learning positive positive negative examples
