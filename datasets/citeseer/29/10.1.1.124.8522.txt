region image querying carson serge belongie greenspan malik computer science division university california berkeley berkeley ca cs berkeley edu retrieving images large varied collections image content key challenging important problem 
new image representation provides transformation raw pixel data small set localized coherent regions color texture space 
called blobworld representation segmentation expectation maximization algorithm combined color texture features 
texture features segmentation arise new approach texture description scale selection 
describe system uses blobworld representation retrieve images 
important unique aspect system context similarity querying user allowed view internal representation submitted image query results 
background best known image database system ibm query image content qbic allows operator specify various properties desired image 
system displays selection potential matches criteria sorted score appropriateness match 
region segmentation largely manual versions qbic contain simple automated segmentation facilities 
photobook incorporates sophisticated representations texture degree automatic segmentation 
examples systems identify materials low level image properties include virage chabot :10.1.1.52.4452
systems codes spatial organization way supports object queries 
classical object rely clean segmentation object rest image designed fixed geometric objects machine parts 
constraint holds case shape size color objects polar bears quite variable segmentation imperfect 
clearly classical object recognition apply 
manner color texture properties region decoupled example zebra gray horse plus stripes 
note formulation color texture descriptor orientation selected scale appear feature centered difference kernel gradient computation factor range 
vector result grouping occur variations scale orientation 
grouping em algorithm image processed color texture feature extraction schemes result large set feature vectors may regard points feature space 
order divide points groups expectation maximization em algorithm determine maximum likelihood parameters mixture gaussians inside feature space :10.1.1.133.4884
em algorithm finding maximum likelihood parameter estimates missing incomplete data 
case missing data region points feature space belong 
estimate values fill incomplete data step compute maximum estimates data step repeat suitable stopping criterion reached 
step applying em algorithm initialize mean vector covariance matrix represent groups 
individual connected components image possess area greater total image area go produce blobs 
blobworld representation 
blob encodes summary information underlying color texture shape properties 
image retrieval querying search engine text familiar reality unwanted matches 
case text searches results ambiguous keywords bank interest :10.1.1.11.9982
unfortunately image queries clear things go wrong 
text searches user see words document current content image retrieval systems allows user see exactly system looking response similarity query 
simply allowing user submit arbitrary image sketch set knobs knowing relate input image particular implies degree complexity searching algorithms 
result query polar bear return just object sun query image regions segmentation routine fails find bear submitted image submitted image contains distinctive objects
