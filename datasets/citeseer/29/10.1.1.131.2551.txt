graph theoretic clustering image grouping retrieval image retrieval algorithms generally assumption visually similar images located close feature space 
feature vectors usually exist high dimensional space parametric characterization distribution impossible non parametric approaches nearest neighbor search retrieval 
introduces graph theoretic approach image retrieval formulating database search graph clustering problem constraint retrieved images consistent close feature space individually similar close query image 
experiments compare retrieval precision clustering showed average precision clustering improvement average precision clustering 

motivation computing feature vectors essential step image database retrieval algorithms computer vision pattern recognition applications
