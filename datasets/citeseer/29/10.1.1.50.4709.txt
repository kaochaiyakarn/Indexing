finding similar documents multiple text databases clement yu king lup liu wu weiyi meng rishe dept eecs university illinois chicago chicago il dept computer science suny binghamton binghamton ny school computer science florida international university miami fl methodology finding similar documents multiple text databases query positive integer methodology consists steps 
databases ranked certain order 
documents retrieved databases order particular way 
databases containing similar documents query ranked ahead databases methodology guarantee retrieval similar documents query 
statistical method provided identify databases estimated contain similar documents 
number strategies retrieve documents identified databases 

number local search engines metasearch engine large careful local search engines invoke query 
query small fraction search engines may contain sufficiently useful documents query 
order avoid reduce possibility invoking useless search engines identify search engines provide useful results query pass query identified search engines 
examples systems employ approach include wais aliweb ggloss savvysearch wise :10.1.1.31.1173
problem identifying potentially useful databases search known database selection problem 

user wants similar documents local databases positive integer documents retrieved identified databases need carefully specified retrieved 
collection fusion problem 

qualitative approaches detailed information document frequency term represent contents database 
information ranking score database computed reflect relative usefulness quality database query 
score database equivalent number potentially useful documents database 
qualitative approach employed version ggloss cori net wise :10.1.1.31.1173

quantitative approaches detailed information represent contents database directly estimate number potentially useful documents database 
estimation approaches belong category 
quantitative approaches vector queries approach binary independent case document represented binary vector ith position indicates absence presence term terms assumed independent

databases experiments 
databases formed articles posed different newsgroups internet 
articles collected stanford university :10.1.1.31.1173
newsgroup contains articles forms separate database 
smaller newsgroups merged produce larger databases 
table shows database size number distinct terms appearing collection documents

query ideal method implemented computing actual global similarity document directly similarities rank databases 
clearly ideal method applicable read metasearch engines
