decoupled simulation virtual reality toolkit chris shaw mark green liang sun department computing science university alberta edmonton alberta canada mark liang cs ca virtual reality vr user interface style allows natural hand body motions manipulate virtual objects environments input devices 
style best suited application areas traditional dimensional styles fall short scientific visualization architectural visualization remote manipulation 
currently programming effort required produce vr application large pitfalls avoided creation successful vr programs 
describe decoupled simulation model creating successful vr applications software system embodies model 
toolkit simplifies development vr applications providing standard facilities required wide range vr user interfaces 
facilities include support distributed computing head mounted displays room geometry management performance monitoring hand input devices sound feedback
