decisions typically considering user keyword query neglecting larger information need 
users specific needs research papers homepages able express needs way affects decisions metasearch engine 
describe metasearch engine architecture considers user information need decision 
users different needs keyword query may search different sub search engines different modifications query results ordered differently 
study lawrence giles estimated size web indexable pages 
study concluded single search engine covered sixteen percent total 
searching multiple search engines simultaneously metasearch engine coverage increases dramatically searching engine 
lawrence giles combining results major search engines increased coverage estimated size publicly indexable web 
consistent interface necessary metasearch engine useful :10.1.1.44.5886
interface ensures results places meaningfully combined user specifics underlying search engines 
describe architecture generation inquirus metasearch tool nec research institute 
architecture shown certain user preferences explicit 
preferences define search strategy specifies source selection query modification result scoring 
studies shown users consider factors including non topical making relevance judgments 
glover birmingham demonstrated decision theory means re ordering results single screen shot inquirus interface architecture standard metasearch engine search engine capturing user information need text query 
nguyen haddawy demonstrated decision theory means making result ordering decisions 
addition properly ordering results choosing look affects search precision 
increase precision results metasearch engines profusion savvysearch metaseek send user query search engines :10.1.1.44.5886:10.1.1.43.8157:10.1.1.98.4787

metaseek considers past results user keywords source selection current version savvysearch allows users specify category determine sources searched 
metasearch engines significantly increase coverage limited engines respect number quality results
