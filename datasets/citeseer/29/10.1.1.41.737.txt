conference assistant combining context awareness wearable computing dey daniel salber gregory abowd gvu center college computing georgia institute technology atlanta ga salber abowd cc gatech edu hitachi research laboratory cho hitachi shi ibaraki ken japan hitachi jp www cc gatech edu describe conference assistant prototype mobile context aware application assists conference attendees 
discuss strong relationship context awareness wearable computing apply relationship conference assistant 
application uses wide variety context enhances user interactions environment users 
describe application context aware architecture 

human human interaction great deal information conveyed explicit communication cues 
context rapidly changes situations user mobile 
changing context adapt user interface application providing relevant services information user 
context important mobile computing general particular interest wearable computing 
evident number papers dealing context awareness previous wearable computers

application conference assistant prototype mobile context aware application assisting conference attendees choosing presentations attend notes retrieving notes 
registration users indicate allowed access information location level interest 
allows users manage information 
related feature allow users access colleagues notes retrieval application 
provide additional information augment user notes presentation source notes presentations user attend 
final feature add context assistant interface supports serendipitous information retrieval relevant current presentation remembrance agent :10.1.1.16.9692
potential information retrieve includes conference field relevant information 
add third retrieval application conference
