query trees called bushy illustrated 
bushy join sequences require materialization intermediate relations 
bushy trees may result cheaper query plan expand cost enumerating search space considerably studies merits exploring bushy join sequences large systems focus linear join sequences restricted subsets bushy join trees 
deferring cartesian products may result poor performance 
decision support queries query graph forms star observed cartesian product appropriate nodes dimensional tables olap terminology results significant reduction cost :10.1.1.121.2733
extensible system behavior join may adapted query basis restrict bushy ness join trees allow disallow cartesian products 
nontrivial determine priori effects tuning quality cost search
