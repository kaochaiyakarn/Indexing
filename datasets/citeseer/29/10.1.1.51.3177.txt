resource discovery knowledge discovery internet school computing science simon fraser university bc canada mail cs sfu ca years ago time modern computers didn exist vannevar bush wrote multimedia digital library containing human collective knowledge filled trails linking materials topic 
world war ii vannevar scientists build knowledge store useful continuously extendable importantly accessible consultation 
today closest materialization vannevar dream world wide web hypertext multimedia document collection 
ease accessibility knowledge described vannevar realized 
extensive research accomplished information retrieval field free text search adopted text repository systems late 
advent world wide web helped text search routine millions users search engines daily pinpoint resources internet 
clustering techniques operate vectors 
document represented dimensional vector number selected index terms 
documents collection terms chosen represented vector 
corresponding position document vector indicates absence term document 
presence term indicated term weight occurrence frequency term document calculated term weight relative occurrence term collection :10.1.1.151.1968
vector model yields representation documents dimensional space 
document point space 
partitioning points groups constitutes cluster formation 
cluster formation methods proposed

important note visibility spider limited connected graph documents starting point 
starting particular document guarantee documents world wide web indirectly connected 
need set starting points ensure better coverage 
directories web sites usually starting points 
spiders usually elaborate search engine manipulate large databases urls :10.1.1.22.3686:10.1.1.109.4049
respect visibility world wide web space important note spiders traverse frame web pages access dynamically generated web pages authenticated ones 
indexer parser receives document downloaded spider parses extract new urls links document 
new passed back spider download 
parsing document text analyzed extract terms indexing 
completeness important factor 
long search result adequately indexing internet portion wouldn matter 
set matching documents set matching documents big difference user 
user go large set identify documents fitting quest 
demonstrated single web search engine provides user relevant documents :10.1.1.21.478
abundance resources internet search query yield hundreds thousands matches 
search engines traditional information retrieval systems rank resources relevancy ordered relevant 
apart size index model chosen indexing user interface important difference search engines ranking mechanism 
relevance subjective term 
represents links web pages 
graph attribute pagerank weight web page ranking pages appearing search result 
mechanism calculate pagerank page number links coming citation number pages pointing pagerank pr gamma theta pr 
factor 
intuitively pagerank represents probability choose page random browsing :10.1.1.22.3686:10.1.1.109.4049
