demonstrates exploitation certain vision processing techniques index case base surfaces 
surfaces result reinforcement learning represent optimum choice actions achieve goal state space 
shows strong features occur interaction system environment detected early learning process 
features allow system identify identical similar task solved previously retrieve relevant surface 
results orders magnitude increase learning rate
