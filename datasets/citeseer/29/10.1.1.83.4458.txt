september project created hour digital video library consisting video clips 
video stored mpeg resolution frames second format 
average clip length minutes consuming megabytes storage 
average clip length minutes consuming megabytes storage 
clip library offers video abstractions title text characters describing clip content poster frame single image represents video clip computed selecting frame clip reducing quarter original resolution 
poster frames displayed simultaneously computer screen 
literature refers similar representative images terms key frame thumbnail image filmstrip set images extracted video clip reduced quarter resolution displayed chronological order 
term literature representative time ordered image set skim compact representation summarizes video clip concatenating significant video audio data match bars compact representation match distribution particular query :10.1.1.33.1714
example scroll bar beneath video match bars indicate times query terms match clip audio video content 
fall informedia digital video library henceforth referred library contains video number diverse sources 
include public television documentaries produced qed communications video course materials united kingdom open university public domain video nasa united states survey government agencies 
wide ranging nature video led develop generic video abstractions domain specific ones applicable certain kinds video 
dropping video regular intervals keeping seconds repeating pattern duration hour video drop essential information video 
subsampling regular intervals trivial implement serves control case pilot study skims 

skim creation process approach currently study informedia project members creating skims utilizes speech recognition image processing natural language recognition extract important content video video data identify important audio video info 
extract identified audio video clips assemble skim components resulting skim plays back quickly preserves important content content components skim :10.1.1.33.1714:10.1.1.46.5528
pilot study conducted informedia team members determine intelligent approaches yield better skims browsing simplistic subsampling approaches 
pilot study compared types skims twelfth size associated video simple skim subsampled skim consisting seconds parent video seconds seconds best audio skim manually ranked segments audio track added skim reaches full video size
