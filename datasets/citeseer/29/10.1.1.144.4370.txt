di erent ways storing types feature data developed far continue try di erent techniques new features developed 
storage boolean object information presence absence horizon image straightforward simply store boolean value horizon attribute 
vision research proceeds new kinds objects identi ed concatenated objects attribute string image just list objects image 
manner eliminate need record false entry object image 
text string indexed retrieval accomplished simple text matching 
complex color texture features colored dot information require careful planning order ensure fast retrieval development ease storage ciency 
interestingly complexity stored feature data inversely related capability image analysis system computer vision systems adept producing high level output ower yellow dot question storage retrieval simpler level detail stored information closely matches level detail desired queries 
storing image features text general store image feature data text strings text substring matching retrievals 
dot information stored text eld image 
nonzero number dots image categorized stored eld separated spaces 
example picture sky clouds large white dots large amount blue dot eld blue large white 
storing feature data text yields best results terms development ease extensibility retrieval speed 
methods storing dots integer boolean values compact encoding scheme feature data order save storage space possibly cut retrieval time 
conservation storage space high priority project fast retrieval time text satisfactory 
advantages text data types 
images signi cant objects signi cant colors color typically just dot attributes represented 
current implementation dots require integer values zero 
dots text string image allows store features image 
added bene development stage vision researchers testing results image database feature data concisely displayed readable form results page little ort developer part 
text means incremental changes stored feature data require elaborate re encoding new attribute names 
text queries simple construct just dots eld illustrated example nd image kind white dots text simply wildcards select statement dots white equivalent integer expression requires comparisons vs white white white white vl white integer queries carefully constructed sure possibilities included expression 
factors contribute faster development time text method bonus system continually changing 
directions plan investigate cient ways store numerical feature data colored dots 
image analysis research progresses expect able low level feature information shape color texture automatically identify higher level concepts images trees buildings people animals kinds boats cars 
high level information available need store low level features dots decrease 
currently feature data stored single table includes images collection
