concept illustrated 
pose estimation similarity vector novel face computed hypothesised pose compared vectors poses 
case similarities measured euclidean distances expect magnitude vector correct pose minimum correct pose 
criterion subject local minima 
constrain criterion focus relevant optimum assume similarity vectors vary smoothly subject changes pose compound criterion including distance current previous similarity vectors ks similarity vector time real valued mixing parameter :10.1.1.10.9610
major problem automatic real time pose tracking know current image face located 
initial position pose face assign search region pose image space seek minimum value criterion equation 
method impractical criterion subject sources noise local optima distract search wrong position scale pose input face may poorly aligned database images illumination conditions may vary database images may poorly aligned position pose 
noise similarity measures compensated incorporating visual cues
