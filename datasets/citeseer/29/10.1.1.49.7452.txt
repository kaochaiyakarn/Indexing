stanford university computer science dept technical report stan cs feb algebraic approach rule analysis expert database systems baralis jennifer widom department computer science stanford university stanford ca cs stanford edu expert database systems extend functionality conventional database systems providing facility creating automatically executing condition action rules 
condition action rules database systems powerful difficult program due unstructured unpredictable nature rule processing 
provide methods static analysis condition action rules methods determine rule set guaranteed terminate rule execution confluent guaranteed unique final state 
methods previous methods analyzing rules active database systems 
improve considerably previous methods providing analysis criteria conservative methods determine rule set terminate confluent previous methods 
improved analysis propagation algorithm uses formal approach extended relational algebra accurately determine action rule affect condition 
lines table useful operators derived basic operators lines additional operators

convenience consider exists semijoin difference operator remainder 
aggregate functions expression evaluation attribute extension operators allow extend relational expression new attribute approach aggregate functions modification operations

rule evaluated condition cond true cond gamma old cond old cond denotes result cond time rule evaluated rule processing 
rule previously evaluated old cond 
informally condition true query produces new tuples 
identical interpretation conditions condition action rules ariel han de set oriented adaptations simplicity consider rules single action expert database systems allow rules sequence actions :10.1.1.46.2504
methods easily extend multiple actions usually simply applying method action bar

similar rule model complicate syntax semantics bearing analysis methods see section discussion 
rule processing invoked set user application modifications database 
database rule languages rule conditions may evaluated entire database opposed considering new data done 
interpretation yields different notion rule activation rule condition remains true execution rule action renders false

fact feeling event rules programmed way practice cw :10.1.1.143.7196
general event condition action rules especially condition evaluated entire database require redefinition rule activation discussed previous point corresponding modifications method
