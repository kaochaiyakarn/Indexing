context information management adaptive collaboration intelligent agents katia sycara robotics institute carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa katia cs cmu edu november number availability electronic information sources increasing current information technology requires manual manipulation details 
accessed information filtered context user task 
current systems lack ability get contextual information automate filtering 
carnegie mellon university engaged retsina project aims develop reusable multiagent software infrastructure allows heterogeneous agents internet possibly developed different designers collaborate manage information context user specified tasks 
chapter provide brief overview system focus capability context information management 
research supported part darpa contract onr 
currently formal languages allow representation task context guide information retrieval 
search engines don adapt search strategies different users 
problem exacerbated information sources high noise pages irrelevant interests particular user 
research intelligent software agents way address issues 
intelligent agents programs act behalf human users perform laborious information gathering tasks hot topics information systems moment :10.1.1.36.7025
years seen marked interest agent oriented technology spanning applications diverse information retrieval user interface design network management 
developing retsina multiagent infrastructure aid users decision making information management information gathering filtering integration tasks 
users delegate tasks retsina agents coordinate fulfill delegated tasks 
retsina multiagent infrastructure provides reusable framework structuring agents operate open information environment internet form adaptive teams demand order solve decision making information management tasks delegated users 
system robustness facilitated middle agents 
agents replicated capabilities 
example warren financial portfolio management application different information agents find stock quotes web security apl 
particular service provider disappears requester agent find similar capabilities appropriate middle agents

advertisement acts commitment agent respond appropriate requests 
general process matchmaking allows agent objective learn name agent take objective 
addition agent shutdown initialization process 
additional question ones circumstances 
search keyword top triggers keyword expand search 
search keywords choice complicated 
assume keywords km expected number refinement words algorithm involves finding trigger pairs keywords highest mutual information take subsets intersections 
detailed algorithm reported :10.1.1.44.3114
allowing automated selection refinement keywords constrain search method provides disambiguation information ambiguous query words 
typical example refinement method helps improve retrieval results 
suppose user interested documents word stock appears financial meaning 
inputting simply keyword stock lycos altavista returns results 
second method ask user explicitly provide labels sub categories interest 
webmate learns categories automatically 
webmate utilizes tf idf method multiple vectors representation 
developed algorithm multi tf idf vector learning summarize 
details see :10.1.1.44.3114
assumed number user interests 
documents user marks extract tf idf vector place different interest profile bucket 
subsequent document calculate cosine similarity tf idf vectors including vectors profile new vector old vectors new vector placed appropriate interests profile bucket
