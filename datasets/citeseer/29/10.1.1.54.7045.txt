logic programming golog logic programming language dynamic domains hector levesque raymond reiter yves lesp lin richard scherl proposes new logic programming language called golog interpreter automatically maintains explicit representation dynamic world modeled basis user supplied axioms preconditions effects actions initial state world 
allows programs reason state world consider effects various possible courses action committing particular behavior 
net effect programs may written higher level abstraction usually possible 
language appears suited applications high level control robots industrial processes intelligent software agents discrete event simulation formal theory action specified extended version situation calculus
