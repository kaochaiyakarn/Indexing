important component data mining projects finding classification algorithm process requires careful thought experimental design 
done carefully comparative studies classification types algorithms easily result statistically invalid 
especially true data mining techniques analyze large databases inevitably contain statistically data 
choice datasets random experiments general statements classification algorithms necessarily valid 
fact draws samples population conduct experiment inferences applied original population case means uci repository 
valid general statements datasets 
way valid uci repository known represent larger population classification problems

evidence strong results uci datasets apply classification problems repository unbiased sample classification problems 
means say uci repository exist
