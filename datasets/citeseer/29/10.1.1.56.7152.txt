hierarchical approach wrapper induction ion muslea steve minton craig knoblock university southern california admiralty way marina del rey ca minton isi edu tremendous amount information available web daily basis ability quickly develop information agents crucial problem 
vital component web information agent set wrappers extract relevant data semistructured information sources 
novel approach wrapper induction idea hierarchical information extraction turns hard problem extracting data arbitrarily complex document series easier extraction tasks 
introduce inductive algorithm stalker generates high accuracy extraction rules user labeled training examples 
labeling training data represents major bottleneck wrapper induction techniques experimental results show stalker significantly better approaches hand stalker requires orders magnitude fewer examples algorithms hand handle information sources wrapped existing techniques 
expansion web computer users gained access large variety comprehensive information repositories 
phone slg start area code 
second iteration algorithm considers uncovered examples generates rule skipto phone skipto 
show slg equivalent disjunctive rule 
order generate rule extracts parent stalker see induce number disjuncts number actual values landmarks form disjunct 
stalker input consists pairs idx sequence tokens content instance idx token represents start sequence :10.1.1.30.8455
idx gamma instance represents positive example sub sequence super sequence represents negative example 
stalker tries generate slg accepts positive examples rejects negative ones 
stalker typical sequential covering algorithm long uncovered positive examples tries learn perfect disjunct sequential la accepts true positives 
positive examples covered stalker returns solution consists slg branch corresponds learned disjunct

noticed practice user rarely patience labeling dozen training examples main point experiments verify stalker generate high accuracy rules just training examples
