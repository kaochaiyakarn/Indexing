techniques defined extensions class hierarchy index 
ch index trees maintains single index classes recommended patrick neil elisa bertino inheritance hierarchy 
ch index efficiently performs single key search range predicates pages necessary accessed 
conversely index efficiently processes range predicates reads pages ch index single key predicates 
techniques principle join index technique proposed valduriez 
particular implicit joins aggregation hierarchies 
main difficulty techniques efficient execution updates 
update performed precomputed joins invalid recomputed 
aggregation indexing techniques classified maintain additional information efficiently perform updates :10.1.1.15.5296
