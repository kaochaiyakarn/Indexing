ulixes defining relational views web section ulixes language definition relational views web 
ulixes designed simple flexible language extracting data web adm scheme 
data extraction process notion navigation site 
navigations ulixes expressed navigational expressions path expressions denoting paths site graph 
perspective site offers essence set navigations pages site navigations allow follow links different pages explore hierarchical structure page represent natural means query page 
consider example scheme 
suppose interested reaching author pages site

navigations site specified navigational expression dot operator 
denotes navigations inside pages link follow links submit semantics expression interpreted possible paths site obtained starting unique instance submitting empty form traversing reaching 
navigations represented tuple values value attribute associated nodes gation navigational expression represented relation relational model sense

note navigational expression require submit link returns page scheme selecting possibilities union type 
language specific mechanisms dealing union types page returned correct type navigates simply returns empty result 
due fact suppose nested structures partitioned normal form pnf emphasize effectiveness flexibility chosen approach 
effective sense provides high level tool extracting data note computing shown queries means browsing require significant effort user 
time approach flexible relational view defined table generated high level query language relational object oriented access data provided manipulate tables 
relational views integrated data sources local data sets views different sites 
example suppose generate large table containing authors db lp bibliography server 
may think applying process bibliography servers integrate views obtain larger set 
integrated database new derived site generated language penelope 
penelope generating derived hypertexts approach discussed previous section interesting considered extraneous web framework users access information navigating hypertexts 
extend view paradigm way data retrieved user hypertext 
show relational views transformed back web hypertexts pages structure appear existing site 
restructuring technique define derived site hypertextual view input sites database support casual queries user wants browse results particularly useful respect complex queries large results 
order reach goal introduce penelope allows definition new page schemes data organized 
penelope provides define page statement specify generate html pages starting database content 
define page statements form define page new page scheme name ii relation iii describes page structure specifying page attributes type correspondence attributes unique keyword optional specify defined page scheme unique 
illustrate semantics statements means example 
suppose ulixes navigate site build table called containing tuple form authors title year leonardo da vinci 
want reorganize papers dividing basis year publication 
year table generate page containing list papers published author year unique page containing list years created provide access year pages 
need restructured scheme described called 
structure pages defined define page statements 
note attributes source table enclosed angle brackets page url url year year text year list authors text authors title text title text page url result html list year text year url year statements generate html code new pages 
statement defines page scheme attribute year multivalued attribute corresponding list papers leonardo published year 
page created different year clearly urls pages generated system time page created new different url needed 
function terms generate urls fact term id year specifies system generate url page scheme url uniquely associated year value define page statement describes pages filled starting attributes relation 
example definition attribute year type text specifies values come attribute year relation 
second statement defines unique page scheme multivalued attribute corresponding list years note case local constant url result 
html assigned corresponding instance 
declare page scheme unique indicate single technique similar skolem invent new oids object oriented databases 
year new page schemes organize papers url assuming unique page generated statement 
page item year list linked corresponding year page value link function term generate urls years pages year 
note want access corresponding conference journal page 
re create pages derived hypertext access original site 
link pages urls existing pages values attribute table extracted ulixes 
essence languages generate hypertext new pages offering different perspective data plus existing portion original site 
define page statements ideas 
local urls identify new pages constant strings strings built function symbol attributes relations 
example result 
html constant local url year denotes local url built values attribute year 
done experiments penelope integrate different sites domain 
system effectively allows generate integrated view existing sites 
possible choose extent derived hypertext locally materialized 
proven useful dealing multimedia data example generated integrated view louvre virtual museums new site integrated list works reported artist image accessible 
order reduce disk storage images downloaded accessed original sites
