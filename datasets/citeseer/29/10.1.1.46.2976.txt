detecting intrusions system calls alternative data models stephanie forrest pearlmutter dept computer science university new mexico albuquerque nm forrest cs unm edu intrusion detection systems rely wide variety observable data distinguish legitimate activities 
study observable sequences system calls kernel operating system 
system call data sets generated different programs compare ability different data modeling methods represent normal behavior accurately recognize intrusions 
compare methods simple enumeration observed sequences comparison relative frequencies different sequences rule induction technique hidden markov models hmms 
discuss factors affecting performance method conclude particular problem weaker methods hmms sufficient 

second method analyze model sequences simpler proposals 
records presence absence sequences compute frequencies distributions identify sequences important 
advantage simple approach computational efficiency question naturally arises accurate models data possible 
past years statistically learning techniques developed 
methods potential generating accurate compact models system call data groups published results experiments alternative models applied system calls :10.1.1.50.2488
available methods designed specific applications idiosyncrasies 
goal compare various methods systematically possible larger realistic suite data sets past 

choosing applicable methods ways system call data characterize normal behavior programs involves building training model traces normal processes 
techniques building deterministic probabilistic automata sort task example 
methods generally determine frequencies individual symbols system calls case occur conditioned number previous symbols 
individual states automaton represent history observed symbols transitions states indicate symbols produced resulting state automaton 
algorithms building automata assumption data stationary 
particularly powerful finite state machine hidden markov model widely speech recognition dna sequence modeling :10.1.1.131.2084
hidden markov model hmm describes doubly stochastic process 
hmm states represent unobservable condition system modeled 
state certain probability producing observable system outputs separate probability indicating states 
having different output probability distributions states allowing system change states time model capable representing nonstationary sequences
