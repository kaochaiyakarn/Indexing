fitness evaluation fitness evaluation main difficulties evolutionary design controllers real robots meyer mataric cliff 
difficulties enhanced case legged robots tend brittle wheeled counterparts fitness evaluations require lot time easily automated 
chose simulations assess fitness controllers advantage argument put forth jakobi jakobi really matters accurately simulate efficient behaviors real robot :10.1.1.53.9514
