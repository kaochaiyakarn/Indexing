integration distributed heterogeneous databases called data integration active area research 
largely inspired proliferation database sources world wide web previous researchers addressed diverse set problems ranging access semi structured information sources combining databases differing schemata :10.1.1.22.7172

taken different heterogeneous databases denoted different constants respectively making impossible join usual way 
general databases contain domains individual constants correspond entities real world examples name domains include course numbers personal names names movie names place names
