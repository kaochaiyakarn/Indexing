representation refer explicit feature representation data items general standard approach euclidean feature vectors pairwise proximities calculated 
approach combined linear embedding classification procedure resulting extension optimal hyperplane algorithm pseudo euclidean data 
general approach characterization set data items de fine proximity distance measure data items necessarily feature vectors provide learning algorithm proximity matrix set training data 
pairwise proximity measures defined structured objects graphs procedure provides bridge classical structural approaches pattern recognition 
additionally pairwise data occur frequently empirical sciences psychology economics biochemistry algorithms developed kind data predominantly clustering multidimensional scaling fall realm unsupervised learning 
contrast nearest neighbor classification schemes suggest algorithms operate proximity data linear models 
brief discussion different kinds proximity data terms possible embeddings suggest optimal hyperplane algorithm classification applied distance data euclidean pseudo euclidean spaces :10.1.1.103.1189
subsequently general model introduced formulated linear threshold model proximities optimized principle structural risk minimization 
demonstrate choice proximity measure influences generalization behavior algorithm apply algorithms real world data biochemistry 
nature proximity data faced proximity data form matrix fp ij pairwise proximity values data items idea embed data suitable space visualization analysis
