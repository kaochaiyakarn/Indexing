framework definition similarity measures lattice valued functions 
show strengths particularly combining similarity measures 
investigate particular instantiation framework sets represent objects denote degrees similarity 
concludes suggesting generalisations findings 
different ways computing similarity object representations 
include feature approach objects represented sets features similarity feature commonality difference geometric approach objects represented points dimensional space usually specified sets pairs attributes atomic values similarity inverse distance objects space structural approach uses graphical representations nodes denote objects edges denote relations objects similarity graph matching 
tri part classification simplification 
may omit distinctive approaches 
may seemingly drive related approaches 
example similarity order terms feature structures elements geometric structural approaches :10.1.1.44.6863
include classification merely order indicate huge variety approaches cbr literature 
discusses general mathematical framework wide variety similarity measures defined combined 
having reported develops earlier lattice functions done osborne 
examples spirit geometric approach previous papers focus feature structural approaches 
example operator similar product disjunction conjunction violate axioms place similarity functions necessarily respect axiom give table excess functions 
authors claim similarity functions reflexive framework stated topmost element lattice 
tversky argues strong may different degrees similarity different identical objects 
consequently see table weaker axiom object similar object 
controversial symmetry richter argues jantke argues ironically new similarity function introduces symmetric tversky argues took symmetry axiom defined similarity measures way guaranteed symmetry :10.1.1.44.6863
adopt symmetry axiom contribution show define asymmetric symmetric similarity measures framework 
quite rare cbr believe strength framework 
accord similarity require transitivity 
may need axioms apply certain instantiations framework
