traditionally integrity constraints database systems maintained rolling back transaction produces inconsistent state disallowing modifying operations may produce inconsistent state 
alternative approach provide automatic repair inconsistent states production rules 
constraint production rule detect constraint violation initiate database operations restore consistency 
describe sql language defining integrity constraints translating constraints constraint maintaining production rules 
parts translation automatic parts require user intervention 
section considers set rules maintaining multiple constraints particular shows potential cyclic behavior rule sets detected 
rule optimization covered section 
section considers system execution showing termination consistent state guaranteed certain assumptions

preliminaries case study examples drawn case study concerning power distribution design system database application supporting design maintenance electricity networks due space limitations portions study included ll details appear technical report cw :10.1.1.143.7196
note constraints considered study supported conventional database systems 
briefly power network connects collection plants collection users possibly intermediate nodes 
network designer determines location plants nodes users 
specified designer power produced plant power required user power loss incurred intermediate node

fully described set invalidating operations derived constraint definition 
note constraint may expressed different ways 
algorithm produce set invalidating operations equivalent constraints

may want extend facility allow multiple rules enforcing 
accommodates possibility different compensating actions may appropriate different invalidating operations 
plan incorporate extension 
sophisticated rule analysis possible 
rule action pre defined table derived condition consequently improved 
describe automatic method transforming rule conditions incorporate kind optimization 
optimized conditions transition table feature rule language provides mechanism referring database changes recall section 
rule enforcing constraint optimization consider tables table list transforming tables appearing condition appropriate transition tables 
consider case table list contains table generalization multiple tables straightforward appears cw :10.1.1.143.7196
consider rule derived constraint table table list 
condition looks exists select predicate optimization applicable condition 
operations listed transition predicate operations table 
table appear clause nested select operation predicate 
union updated cn predicate notice neu values updated tuples 
union clause named predicate handled appropriately 
assuming inserted updated tuples form small portion original table transformation yield significant improvement rule condition evaluation 
improvement may gained rule action logical table inherit optimization 
correctness transformation proven formally cw :10.1.1.143.7196
restrictions applying optimization may limiting fact rules derived constraints meet requirements 
exactly half rules case study eligible 
example consider constraint wire voltage exceed maximum wire type 
enforcing rule transition predicate condition inserted wire updated type updated voltage exists select wire voltage select mar voltage wire type type type condition voltage checked wires database 
wires checked inserted type voltage changed 
system execution far primarily considered static aspects facility 
constraint definition rule derivation strictly speaking assign new name appropriate column list table expression changing accordingly 
details particularly interesting omitted 
invalidating operations table wire type omitted case study table considered readonly cw :10.1.1.143.7196
rule analysis optimization performed prior system execution 
execution time focus study ensure derived rules behave desired consistency respect constraints guaranteed 
rules activated transaction consider arbitrary transaction showing rule execution terminate constraints valid 
certain assumptions aspects constraints translation performed user 
plan continue extending functionality system improvements respects 
particular incorporate additional labeling optimizations conservative derivation invalidating insert delete operations perform complete rule analysis eliminate trivially impossible cycles define additional rule optimizations allow multiple rules enforcing single constraint
