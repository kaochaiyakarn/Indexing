propose indexing method time sequences processing similarity queries 
discrete fourier transform dft map time sequences frequency domain crucial observation sequences practical interest frequencies strong 
important observation theorem specifies fourier transform preserves euclidean distance time frequency domain 
having mapped sequences space fourier coefficients trees index sequences efficiently answer similarity queries 
provide experimental results show method superior search sequential scanning 
experiments show coefficients adequate provide performance 
performance gain method increases number length sequences
