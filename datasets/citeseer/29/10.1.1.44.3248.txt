implemented founded semantics slg wam xsb 
performance results indicate overhead delay simplification prolog tabled evaluations minimal 
compute founded semantics slg wam adds efficient tabling engine operations negative loop detection delay simplification serve detect break resolve cycles negation arise evaluating normal programs xsb full prolog system closely approximates iso standard additionally supports tight integration tabled predicates predicates 
xsb research oriented logic programming system unix windows dos systems 
addition providing functionality prolog xsb contains features usually logic programming systems including ffl evaluation founded semantics full slg resolution ffl compiled hilog implementation ffl variety indexing techniques asserted code novel transformation technique called unification factoring improve program speed indexing compiled code ffl source code availability portability extensibility 
components xsb prolog version sb prolog 
xsb prolog system avoid referring xsb availability slg resolution handling hilog terms 
facilities seemingly simple significantly extend capabilities typical prolog system 
feel capabilities justify viewing xsb new paradigm logic programming 
understand implications slg resolution recall prolog depth search strategy sld uses program clause resolution :10.1.1.38.8814
prolog susceptible getting lost infinite branch search tree may loop infinitely 
slg evaluation available xsb correctly evaluate logic programs 
take simplest examples query program table ancestor 
ancestor parent 
prolog system xsb interesting features fast compilation dynamic code 
ii object file compilation 
iii module system inference symbol usage compilation 
iv dynamic loading prolog code 
goal xsb provide implementation engine logic programming memory deductive database queries :10.1.1.48.4048
prerequisite functionality ability load large amount data quickly 
taken care code compiler asserted clauses 
result speed asserting retracting code faster xsb prolog system know 
time asserted code compiled slg wam code speed executing asserted code xsb faster 
maintaining information repeated call ancestor body second clause detected 
idea store partial solutions call table consists calls associated answers 
answers substituted call ancestor body second clause 
joined second literal second clause substitutions general produce new solutions query new solutions turn fed body second clause fixpoint reached 
language call leftmost goal called generator node expanded program clauses sld resolution prolog :10.1.1.38.8814
correct answer substitutions solution node table entry call plus returns call

subsequent calls subsequent variant subsumed calls referred active nodes expanded answers derived goal program clauses 
computation ends possible program clauses expand generator nodes answers returned active nodes 
perspective stratification programs dynamically stratified 
xsb fact handles programs evaluating founded semantics 
semantics natural extension programmer perspective 
shown program dynamically stratified valued founded model 
furthermore elaborate forms nonmonotonic reasoning stable models built founded model :10.1.1.24.6050
xsb provides residual program explained evaluate stable models program 
intuition founded semantics explained operations tabling 
consider tabling acts ground definite program 
ground atom true successful derivation atom false derivation path ends cases 
cylinder array nodes nodes row connected elements higher row 
executing query slg orders magnitude faster sld sld search complete binary tree depth 
judicious tabling programs faster programs slower 
instance tabling append slows linear algorithm quadratic 
detailed analysis performance xsb :10.1.1.48.4048
performance founded negation knowledge win program standard scalable benchmark wellfounded semantics literature 
slg sldnf versions xsb shown 
sldnf resolution sufficient acyclic move graphs chains trees 
cases founded model total 
chains trees program modularly stratified subgoal answer fails 
shows case chain performance tabled negation comparable negation prolog times slower 
difference due recording subgoals answers tables suspending computations performing completion 
case complete binary tree tabled negation slower 
tabled negation fully evaluate negative literals completing consequently traverses entire search space exponential height tree see :10.1.1.48.4048
tuples move relation sld chain slg chain sld tree slg tree slg cycle performance win program different data structures 
goal xsb system provide framework environment gracefully integrates logic programming deductive database query processing nonmonotonic reasoning respect founded semantics 
fact produces residual program normal logic programs means preprocessor nonmonotonic formalisms just founded semantics 
xsb provides extensive builtin support accessing generated tables including residual program general programmability predicate appends lists xsb environment build complex nmr systems
