user marked articles relevant information need system able automatically learn user profile able route send new potentially interesting articles user 
problem called selective dissemination information information filtering 
current state art routing algorithms learn user profile training examples articles marked relevant user non relevant articles 
learned profile known routing feedback query obtained user relevance feedback matched new articles system encounters example new news stories 
new article matches user profile adequately article assumed potential interest user routed user :10.1.1.21.466
matching algorithm systems match new article user profile relatively straight forward 
current ir systems standard text matching algorithms match new articles profile
