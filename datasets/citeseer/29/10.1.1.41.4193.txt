data structures algorithms nearest neighbor search general metric spaces peter yianilos consider computational problem finding nearest neighbors general metric spaces 
particular interest spaces may conveniently embedded approximated euclidian space dimensionality euclidian representation high 
relevant high dimensional euclidian settings distribution data sense lower dimension embedded space 
vp tree vantage point tree introduced forms associated algorithms improved method difficult search problems 
tree construction executes log time search certain circumstances limit log expected time 
theoretical basis approach developed results experiments reported 
contrasts coordinate aligned cuts see figures computed euclidian cluster centroids 
randomized algorithms vp tree construction execute delta log time resulting tree occupies linear space 
completeness early dealing special cases mentioned 
retrieval similar binary keys considered rivest max metric setting focus 
voronoi provided useful tool low dimensional euclidian settings vp tree decomposition kd tree decomposition field outlook computational geometry yielded interesting results earlier :10.1.1.125.6778
unfortunately kd tree constructions computational geometry provide practical solution high dimensions 
dimension increases kd tree soon visits nearly database element constructions rapidly consume storage space 
furthermore database sense moderately high dimension may possible convenient find implement dimension reducing transformation 
important develop techniques deal raw data exhibit behavior close possible intrinsic representational dimension
