sparse mode protocols number advantages dense mode protocols

multicast protocols broadcast prune explicit join mechanism 
broadcast prune protocols called dense mode protocols shortest path tree rooted source 
class protocols assumes hosts receivers require routers explicitly prune unwanted traffic 
explicit join protocols called sparse mode protocols shortest path tree shared tree 
sparse mode protocol assumes receivers necessarily want multicast traffic require explicit joins 
shared tree uses core rendezvous point bring sources receivers

msdp peer caches sa messages msdp peers take advantage cached information 
non caching msdp peer send sa request message msdp peer perform caching 
minimizing join latency basically translates tradeoff storage state information latency 
information cached shorter join latency 
particularly desirable tradeoff significant state may required provide sufficiently small latency 
problem caused bursty sources 
example consider case session announcement protocol sap packets 
sap packets sent periodically sdr tool 
advertising session send packet rp hear packet flood sa message group receivers send joins source 
multicast forwarding state existed packet originally sent takes non zero amount time forward sa messages receivers establish forwarding state original packet dropped 
sap packets sent original join state times minutes process re done 
tree establishment takes non zero amount time packets transmission lost
