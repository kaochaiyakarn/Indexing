architecture centric object oriented design method multi agent systems cho kim park graduate school management korea advanced institute science technology dong gu korea ac kr department statistics national university kung dong korea stat ac kr introduces architecture centric objectoriented design method mas multi agent systems extended uml unified modeling language 
uml extension characteristics mas concept software architecture helps design reusable structured multi agent architecture 

due popularity complexity mas multi agent systems need systematic development mas increasing rapidly :10.1.1.53.3254
object oriented methodologies natural mas development current limitations properly representing mas :10.1.1.53.3254
limitations include representation mental states agent collaboration agents 
architecture centric design means architecture system primary artifact design development system 
architectural constructs primitive building blocks mas 
constructs concerned constraints model modeling element
