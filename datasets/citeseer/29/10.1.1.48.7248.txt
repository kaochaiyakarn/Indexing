stochastic simulation algorithms dynamic probabilistic networks kanazawa daphne koller stuart russell computer science division university california berkeley ca usa stochastic simulation algorithms likelihood weighting give fast accurate approximations posterior probabilities probabilistic networks methods choice large networks 
unfortunately special characteristics dynamic probabilistic networks represent stochastic temporal processes mean standard simulation algorithms perform poorly 
essence simulation trials diverge reality process observed time 
simulation algorithms evidence observed time step push set trials back reality 
algorithm evidence reversal er time slice evidence nodes slice ancestors state variables 
second algorithm called survival fittest sampling sof set trials time step stochastic reproduction rate weighted likelihood evidence trial
