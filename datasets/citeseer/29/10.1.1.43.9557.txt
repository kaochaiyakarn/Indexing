introduces new statistical approach automatically partitioning text coherent segments 
approach technique incrementally builds exponential model extract features correlated presence boundaries labeled training text 
models classes features topicality features adaptive language models novel way detect broad changes topic cue word features detect occurrences specific words may domain specific tend near segment boundaries 
assessment approach quantitative qualitative grounds demonstrates effectiveness different domains wall street journal news articles television broadcast news story transcripts 
quantitative results domains new probabilistically motivated error metric combines precision recall natural flexible way 
texttiling algorithm introduced hearst simple domain independent technique assigns score topic boundary candidate inter sentence gap cosine similarity measure chunks words appearing left right candidate 
topic boundaries placed locations valleys measure adjusted coincide known paragraph boundaries 
texttiling straightforward implement require extensive training labeled data 
texttiling designed slightly different problem addressed study

furthermore texttiling segments paragraph level doesn assume presence explicit paragraph boundaries 
applications video retrieval may speech recognition transcripts closed captions lack structural markup
