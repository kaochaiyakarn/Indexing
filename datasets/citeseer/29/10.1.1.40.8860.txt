logic reasoning probabilities ronald fagin joseph halpern megiddo ibm almaden research center san jose ca email fagin ibm com halpern ibm com megiddo ibm com consider language reasoning probability allows statements probability probability twice probability arbitrary events 
consider case events measurable represent measurable sets general case interest practice may measurable 
measurable case essentially formalization propositional fragment nilsson probabilistic logic 
show companion general case corresponds precisely replacing probability measures dempster shafer belief functions 
cases provide complete axiomatization show problem deciding satisfiability np complete worse propositional logic 
tool proving complete axiomatizations give complete axiomatization reasoning boolean combinations linear inequalities independent interest
