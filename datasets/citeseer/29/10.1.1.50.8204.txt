evaluate proposed rule learning algorithm irep large diverse collection benchmark problems 
show irep extremely efficient frequently gives error rates higher rules 
propose number modifications resulting algorithm competitive rules respect error rates efficient large samples 
obtains error rates lower equivalent rules benchmark problems scales nearly linearly number training examples efficiently process noisy datasets containing hundreds thousands examples 
systems learn sets rules number desirable properties
