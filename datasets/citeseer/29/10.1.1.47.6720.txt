preventing overfitting cross validation data andrew ng school computer science carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa andrew ng cs cmu edu suppose learning task select hypothesis set hypotheses may example generated multiple applications randomized learning algorithm 
common approach evaluate hypothesis set previously unseen cross validation data select hypothesis lowest cross validation error 
cross validation data partially corrupted noise set hypotheses selecting large folklore overfitting crossvalidation data sax tukey tukey 
explain overfitting really occurs show surprising result overcome selecting hypothesis higher cross validation error lower cross validation errors 
give reasons selecting hypothesis lowest cross validation error propose new algorithm uses computationally efficient form leave crossvalidation select hypothesis 
experimental results domain show consistently beating picking hypothesis lowest cross validation error reasonably large cross validation sets
