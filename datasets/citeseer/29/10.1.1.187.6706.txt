appears proceedings acm sigmod conference san jose ca may broadcast disks data management asymmetric communication environments swarup acharya brown university sa cs brown edu alonso alonso research com michael franklin university maryland franklin cs umd edu stanley zdonik brown university cs brown edu proposes repetitive broadcast way augmenting memory hierarchy clients asymmetric communication environment 
describe new technique called broadcast disks structuring broadcast way provides improved performance non uniformly accessed data 
broadcast disk multiple disks spinning different speeds single broadcast channel effect creating arbitrarily fine grained memory hierarchy 
addition proposing defining mechanism main result exploiting potential broadcast structure requires basic cache 
examine pure cache management policies develop measure implementable approximations policies 
results set simulation studies basic idea develops intuitions required design particular broadcast program
