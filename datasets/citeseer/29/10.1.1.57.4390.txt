weak consistency distributed data warehouses stanoi agrawal el abbadi department computer science university california santa barbara ca agrawal cs ucsb edu propose analyze novel multiple view model distributed data warehouse 
views represented hierarchical fashion incorporating data base sources possibly views 
current approaches maintain consistency model require data stored view derived base data different paths state base relation 
type consistency criterion restrictive applications 
propose relaxing synchronization constraints view level develop model allows views set constraints enforcing individual conditions pairs paths 
define correctness criteria updates particular model analyze new requirements necessary maintaining consistency data

keywords multi view data warehouse distributed system consistency updates data warehouse acts repository integrating summarizing information diverse sources 
primary architecture data warehouse centralized repository information containing views derived various data sources :10.1.1.19.5246:10.1.1.48.4672
increasingly data warehouse technology extended integrate information available locally enterprise externally outside resources 
major application marketing due advances information technology allow analysis customer transactions 
opportunity access larger amounts internal external information key factor identifying consumer needs global scale 
data warehousing data mining today important tools marketing providing companies way products adapt th international conference foundations data organization kobe japan november 
constraint distributed data warehouse model background motivation traditionally data warehouse consists view stored single site network contents view materialized multiple data sources base relations distributed network 
primary importance performance data warehouses ability reduce frequency external updates size messages involved 
case incremental view maintenance update protocols proposed ensure correct materialization single view data warehouse 
eca algorithm guarantees consistency views single source 
strobe sweep algorithms proposed handle multiple database sites :10.1.1.48.4672
generalize centralized data warehouse model ways 
distributed data warehouse model multiple views maintained views stored distributed manner multiple sites 
notion multiple views maintained single homogeneous data warehouse proposed colby temporal order updates assumed views updated order 
distributed environment total order unrealistic implies global clock model depend restriction 
view calculates changes appends local table changes 
materialized view defined older state view answer queries reflect date state materialized version table changes 
entries table integrated actual view incorporated directly dependent views 
ancestor views answer queries materialized data table changes base sources answer queries state 
keeping log deltar direct ancestors view able compensate updates reflected current version relation included corresponding view vector :10.1.1.48.4672
example example different steps needed correctly propagate updates base relations view consider hierarchy composed base sources views derive data directly base relations views incorporate data directly views 
relationship views ancestors top table 
conditional view dependency graph illustrates different consistency constraints imposed pair view children common descendent 
correctness assignment constraints demonstrated acyclicity corresponding cv graphs 
sites initiated state reflects version base relations 
simplicity consider view vectors represent initial versions number 
base relation updated twice due changes deltar deltar relations updated 
view receives deltar queries base sources increments vector accordingly updates table changes forwards information view decides refresh data compares vectors attached updates received pairwise consistency conditions ancestors case sink updates incorporated furthermore view vector reflects date versions constraint imposed updates case effect 
result updates integrated query ancestors vector :10.1.1.137.3356
note respect base relations derives data versions incorporate information table changes actual materialized view discard entries table changes 
updates view integrated updates storage remains unchanged
