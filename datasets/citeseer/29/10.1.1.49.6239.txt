university pennsylvania founded benjamin franklin institute research cognitive science active part decomposition shape motion estimation articulated objects physics approach metaxas bajcsy ircs report university pennsylvania street suite philadelphia pa november site nsf science technology center research cognitive science appear ieee computer vision pattern recognition conference seattle washington june active part decomposition shape motion estimation articulated objects physics approach metaxas bajcsy grasp laboratory department computer information science university pennsylvania philadelphia pa novel robust integrated approach segmentation shape motion estimation articulated objects 
initially assume object consists single part fit deformable model data physics framework 
object attains new postures decide certain criteria replace initial model new models 
criteria model state data 
fit models data novel algorithm assigning forces data models allows partial overlap determination joint location approach applied iteratively object moving parts identified 
furthermore define new global deformations demonstrate technique series experiments kalman filtering employed account noise occlusion
