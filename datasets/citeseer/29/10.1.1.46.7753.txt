effective retrieval distributed collections xu jamie callan center intelligent information retrieval computer science department university massachusetts amherst amherst ma usa www cs umass edu xu www cs umass edu callan evaluates retrieval effectiveness distributed information retrieval systems realistic environments 
find large number collections available retrieval effectiveness significantly worse centralized systems mainly typical queries adequate purpose choosing right collections 
propose techniques address problem 
phrase information collection selection index query expansion 
techniques enhance discriminatory power typical queries choosing right collections significantly improve retrieval results 
query expansion particular brings effectiveness searching large set distributed collections close searching centralized collection 
collection selection index consists set virtual documents light weight representation collection 
specifically virtual document collection simply complete list words collection frequencies numbers containing documents 
query posted system compares virtual documents decide collections contain relevant documents query 
document retrieval take place collections 
complete discussion system :10.1.1.26.106
virtual documents concise representation requiring space taken underlying document collections :10.1.1.26.106
furthermore process creating virtual documents completely automatic scales realistic environment 
primary concern retrieval effectiveness distributed information retrieval

things different previous area 
firstly sets distributed collections far realistic previous studies 
sets collections large consisting collections 
contrast previous studies usually consisted small number collections :10.1.1.127.4459:10.1.1.33.2482:10.1.1.26.106
see number collections distributed environment significantly affect retrieval effectiveness 
secondly evaluation actual relevance judgment data trec conferences 
contrast studies evaluation performed absence actual relevance data 
gravano example boolean satisfaction query document relevance 
gravano example boolean satisfaction query document relevance 
find typical queries effectiveness searching large set distributed collections significantly worse searching single centralized collection 
primary cause typical queries adequate document retrieval suitable collection selection 
fortunately problem largely solved query expansion 
typical queries expanded local context analysis retrieval effectiveness searching large set distributed collections rival searching centralized collection small number collections searched :10.1.1.49.3174

callan lu croft compared retrieval effectiveness searching set distributed collections searching centralized collection :10.1.1.26.106
significant difference retrieval performance distributed centralized searching half collections searched query average 
total number collections small percentage collections searched high results may reflect true retrieval performance realistic distributed environment 
gravano evaluated capability gloss system choosing right collections query 
experiments carried set collections 
study initial search centralized index returns highly ranked blocks query 
second retrieval returns highly ranked documents highly ranked blocks 
retrieval performance highly dependent block size 
severe degradation performance observed block contains documents 
despite difference terminology general concept collection selection index occurred studies :10.1.1.127.4459
collection selection index typically contains list textual objects concise description content collection 
studies collection selection index assumes complex hierarchical structure 
common technique describe content collection words occur collection frequency occurrences

query expansion technique local context analysis lca :10.1.1.49.3174
reasons choose lca 
firstly lca shown effective query expansion technique completely automatic 
secondly requires expansion terms occur words original query 
pick topic words query techniques expand query words independently

comparison trec trec sets experiments contain collections respectively 
results realistic theirs 
sites collections may unwilling export phrase information may different procedures recognize 
despite problems think adding phrases collection selection index valuable option relatively simple procedure significantly improves retrieval effectiveness 
query expansion conjectured section discriminatory power typical queries collection selection largely enhanced adding specific words query expansion

local context analysis lca query expansion technique local context analysis lca :10.1.1.49.3174
lca requires document collection order query expansion 
expand query retrieval system inquery case retrieves number top ranked documents document portions passages presents lca 
lca analyzes top ranked documents passages returns number concepts query

technique merging retrieval results needs improved 
merges documents different collections locally computed scores
