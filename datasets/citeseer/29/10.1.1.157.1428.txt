probabilistic relational models probabilistic relational model prm specifies template probability distribution database 
template describes relational schema domain probabilistic dependencies attributes domain 
prm particular database objects relations defines probability distribution attributes objects relations 
relational schema schema relational model describes set classes class associated set descriptive attributes set slots 
set descriptive attributes class denoted 
attribute class denoted domain values denoted 
assume domains finite fundamental limitation approach 
example class descriptive attributes gender domain male female 
set slots class denoted 
denote slot 
slot typed domain type range type class 
slot denotes function 
example class slots actor range class movie range class 
useful distinguish entity relationship entity relationship diagrams 
language classes represent entities relationships 
relationship role relates actors movies represented class slots class actor class movie 
denote set classes represent entities denote represent relationships 
generic term object refer entities relationships 
semantics language straightforward 
instantiation specifies set objects class values attribute slots object

section extend probabilistic model allow structural uncertainty 
treat relational structure background knowledge choose model explicitly probabilistic framework

explore simple natural models uncertainty existence uncertainty 
uncertainty model assume objects prespecified relations slots subject random choices 
full relational skeleton assume object skeleton

simple example uncertainty probability distribution directly 
approach major flaws 
obviously distribution require parameter object 
importantly want dependency model general apply possible object skeletons distribution defined terms objects specific object skeleton apply 
achieve general compact representation partitioning class subsets values attributes 
assume value chosen selecting partition selecting object partition uniformly 
example shown partition class movie genre indicating movie theater selects genre movie wants show uniformly movies selected genre 
decision genre depend type theater 
intuition precise defining slot set partition attributes 
example shows genre 
need specify distribution value falls partition versus 
accomplish introducing new attribute called selector attribute takes value space possible instantiations 
possible value determines subset value referent selected 
represent resulting partition 
represent probabilistic model values specifying objects subset partition versus 
define probabilistic model selector attribute 
model attribute set parents cpd 
cpd specify probability distribution possible instantiations 
descriptive attributes allow distribution slot depend aspects domain 
example independent movie theater may show foreign movies may prefer show 
cpd movie parent type 
choice value determines partition value chosen choice value uniformly distributed set 
definition probabilistic relational model uncertainty components definition 
addition slot set attributes new selector attribute takes values cross product space set parents cpd 
define semantics extension define probability slots descriptive attributes take refer instantiation attributes object instantiation note term eq 
depends ways interpretation values attributes pa pa object size 
guarantee dependencies acyclic object skeleton 
accomplish goal extending definition class dependency graph 
graph node descriptive selector attribute edges descriptive selector attribute parents introduce edge 
descriptive selector attribute parents add edge 
slot add edge 
class edges definition identical definition dependency graph deals selector descriptive attributes 
edges second type reflect fact specific choice parent node depends value parent slot 
edges third type represent dependency slot attributes associated partition 
see required observe choice value depends values partition attributes different objects 
attributes determined determined
