mining sequential patterns rakesh agrawal ramakrishnan srikant ibm almaden research center harry road san jose ca large database customer transactions transaction consists customer id transaction time items bought transaction 
introduce problem mining sequential patterns databases 
algorithms solve problem empirically evaluate performance synthetic data 
proposed algorithms apriorisome comparable performance albeit apriorisome performs little better minimum number customers support sequential pattern low 
scale experiments show apriorisome scale linearly number customer transactions 
excellent scale properties respect number transactions customer number items transaction
