dedale system complex spatial queries st grumbach universit di roma tre inria le chesnay france grumbach inria fr philippe rigaux paris france rigaux fr luc inria le chesnay france luc inria fr presents dedale spatial database system intended overcome limitations current systems providing non specialized data model query language representation manipulation spatial objects 
dedale relies logical model linear constraints generalizes constraint database model kkr 
classical constraint model spatial data decomposed convex components dedale holes allowed fit need practical applications 
logical representation spatial data slightly costly memory advantage simplifying algorithms 
dedale relies nested relations sorts data thematic spatial stored uniform fashion 
new data model supports declarative query languages allow intuitive efficient manipulation spatial objects
