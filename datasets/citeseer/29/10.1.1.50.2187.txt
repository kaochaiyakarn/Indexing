patterns yield useful insights obvious synthesize local sparse information coherent global predictive model 
study cross entropy approach combining local patterns 
local pattern viewed constraint appropriate high order joint distribution interest 
typically set patterns returned data mining algorithm constrains high order model 
cross entropy criterion select specific distribution constrained family relative prior
