topical locality web brian davison department computer science rutgers state university new jersey new brunswick nj usa davison cs rutgers edu web pages linked related content 
idea combined says text possibly html anchors describe pages point foundation usable worldwide web 
examine extent ideas hold empirically testing topical locality mirrors spatial locality pages web 
particular find likelihood linked pages having similar textual content high similarity sibling pages increases links parent close titles descriptions anchor text represent part target page anchor text may useful discriminator unseen child pages 
results show foundations necessary success web systems including search engines focused crawlers linkage analyzers intelligent web agents

search engines index text fields citing problems search engine spamming authors place keywords text relevant current page designed draw traffic popular search terms 
search ranking systems traditionally search engines text analysis find pages relevant query 
today search engines incorporate additional factors user popularity actual user traffic link popularity pages link page various forms page status calculations
