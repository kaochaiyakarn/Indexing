rapid bushy join order optimization cartesian products vance oregon graduate institute science technology cse ogi edu www cse ogi edu disc david maier oregon graduate institute science technology maier cse ogi edu www cse ogi edu disc query optimizers limit search space join orderings example excluding cartesian products subplans restricting plan trees left deep 
widely assumed reduce optimization effort minimally affecting plan quality 
show searching complete space plans affordable previously recognized common may little benefit 
start presenting cartesian product optimizer requires seconds workstation time search space bushy plans products relations 
building result join order optimizer achieves similar level performance retains ability include cartesian products subplans appropriate 
main contribution fully separating join order enumeration predicate analysis showing problem particular solved novel implementation techniques
