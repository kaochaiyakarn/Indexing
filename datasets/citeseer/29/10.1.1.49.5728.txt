accurate classifier essential component hypertext database 
hyperlinks pose new problems addressed extensive text classification literature 
links clearly contain highquality semantic clues lost purely classifier exploiting link information non trivial noisy 
naive terms link neighborhood document degrade accuracy 
contribution propose robust statistical models relaxation labeling technique better classification exploiting link information small neighborhood documents

text classifier performed poorly web documents extremely diverse featuring home pages topical resource lists hierarchical html documents generated automatically active pages scripts links broad area little consistency vocabulary 
web documents short serving merely list resource links
