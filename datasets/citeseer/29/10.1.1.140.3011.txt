march document clustering word clustering important studied problems 
vector space model document collection may represented word document matrix 
novel idea modeling document collection bipartite graph documents words 
model pose clustering problem graph partitioning problem give new spectral algorithm simultaneously yields clustering documents words 
algorithm uses second left right singular vectors appropriately scaled word document matrix yield 
basic representation words features document clustering algorithms proposed 
various algorithms differ mathematical models efficiency scalability

underlying assumption words typically appear associated similar concepts 
word clustering profitably automatic classification documents see 
word clusters show underlying concepts associated document clusters recall words stemmed example 
table shows similar document clustering obtained fewer words 
algorithm small collections

best knowledge clustering problem studied previously 
general data matrices earlier appears limited matrices small dimensions 
current software important drawbacks returns equal sized clusters ii optimizes different objective function iii accept integer edge weights 
web documents bipartite graphs links enhance web search results 
plan combine words links uniform manner clustering web documents 
main contribution bipartite graph model text collections successfully applied clustering
