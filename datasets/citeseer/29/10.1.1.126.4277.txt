reasons success compelling bdi model combines respectable philosophical model human practical reasoning originally developed michael bratman number implementations irma architecture various prs systems currently available successful applications including famous fault diagnosis system space shuttle factory process control systems business process management elegant logical semantics taken elaborated widely agent research community :10.1.1.55.3666
argued bdi model somewhat dated principles architecture established mid remained essentially unchanged 
explosion interest intelligent agents multi agent systems occurred great architectures developed argued address issues bdi model fundamentally fails 
furthermore focus agent research ai general shifted significantly bdi model originally developed 
new advances understanding russell subramanian model agents led radical changes agents community generally artificial intelligence community views enterprise :10.1.1.52.5735
response pollack want clarifying distinction things models practical reasoning employ folk psychology concepts belief desire intention 
call belief desire intention bdi models 
particular bdi models center claims originally bratman role intentions focusing practical reasoning 
specifically bratman argued rational agents tend focus practical reasoning intentions adopted tend bypass full consideration options conflict intentions

questions set principle asked classes entity consideration bdi models irma models prs applications 
third question asks appropriate research agenda interested irma models 
crucial development computationally sound accounts various practical reasoning tasks performed irma agents 
great deal attention paid questions commitment intention revision surprising questions central bratman claim 
reasoning tasks irma agents perform 
example deliberate alternatives compatible existing plans triggered override john horty developing mechanisms weighing alternatives context existing plans :10.1.1.55.3666
example hinted earlier comments irma agents need able perform means reasoning 
standard reasoning ai plan generation irma agent reasoning account existing plans 
plan merging notably yang may relevant 
final example irma agents capable committing partial plans
