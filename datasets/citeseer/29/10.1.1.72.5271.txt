artificial intelligence belief awareness limited reasoning ronald fagin joseph halpern ibm almaden research center san jose ca recommended daniel bobrow new logics belief knowledge introduced studied property agents logically omniscient 
particular logics set beliefs agent necessarily contain valid formulas 
logics suitable traditional logics modelling beliefs humans machines limited reasoning capabilities 
logic essentially extension levesque logic implicit explicit belief extend allow multiple agents higher level belief beliefs beliefs 
second logic deals explicitly awareness roughly speaking necessary aware concept beliefs 
third logic gives model local reasoning agent viewed society minds cluster beliefs may contradict 
taken internal view awareness knowledge belief 
spoken agent knowing formulas aware having beliefs beliefs 
corresponds classical view reflective agent reasoning knowledge belief 
argued useful way analyzing distributed systems machines ascribing knowledge processes components cf 
:10.1.1.31.1525
idea view process system local state system global state 
denote process local state global state process said know global state true global states 
global states system possible worlds kripke structure 
define iff easy see definition equivalence relation global states 
formally kripke structure local reasoning tuple set states zr 
truth assignment primitive propositions state yi nonempty set nonempty subsets wish capture knowledge belief need impose added condition member set 
intuitively 
tk state agent depend ing state mind issues focussing believes set possible states precisely believes set possible states precisely view sets representing precisely worlds member society agent mind thinks possible 
just singleton set state say structure equivalent structures previous section interpret exactly modal operators appropriate capturing viewpoint agent society minds exactly discussed capturing knowledge group :10.1.1.31.1525
interpret bi agent believes frame mind member society minds making believes 
note symbol language mentioned similar approaches avoiding logical omniscience independently discussed levesque 
fact models viewed special cases minimal models known neighborhood scott montague models satisfy added conditions set sets closed supersets nonempty cf
