behavioral interface simulate agent object interactions real time shows new approach model control interactive objects simulations virtual human agents real time interactivity essential 
general conceptualization model objects behaviors provide information functionality changes appearance parameterized deformations complete plan possible interaction virtual human 
behaviors described simple primitive commands actual trend standard scene graph file formats connects language movements events create interactive animations 
case special attention correctly interpret object behaviors parallel situation arrives human agents interact time object 
keywords virtual humans virtual environments object modeling object interaction script languages parameterized deformations 
necessity interactive objects virtual environments appears applications computer animation simulation field 
proposed systems literature similar ideas 
particular object specific reasoning creates relational table inform object purpose specific data object graspable site 
information perform mainly grasping tasks 
framework interested modeling objects may complex functionality interact agent time 
example objects smart lift deal simultaneously agents crowd simulation inside virtual city environment :10.1.1.39.3253
lift example shown previous objects automatic doors 

smart lift necessary pre modeled information able take control agents want enter floor go floor 
connected script language object movements state variables able program complex object functionality
