developing recommender system calvin text analysis algorithm wordsieve unobtrusively context previous document accesses suggest documents similar prior contexts 
calvin monitors user browsing capture proactively provide task relevant information 
personal information agents watson similar aims :10.1.1.31.3135
distinguishes calvin approach retrieving documents solely local information calvin extracts information user tends access groups documents time predicts document relevance similarity extended sessions various documents accessed 
illustrate consider example person reading web page ibm intelligent agents project 
user interested specifically agents case page probably source information agents 
alternatively user interested jobs ibm case page probably place learn 
studying document content enable distinguishing situations 
sufficient local task information may enable making distinction user writing agents 
information may available user simply performing browsing task 
hand user tends research agents accessing documents agents time documents ibm pattern document accesses suggests user come page learn agents 
case system page information agents calvin screen shot recommendations situation shown 
wordsieve competitive learning text analysis algorithm choose dimensions term vector space 
runs fast real time user accessing documents requires explicit feedback user 
calvin uses wordsieve automatically learn keywords tend partition user document access streams different contexts uses terms characterize user current context purpose indexing searching 
initial tests promising ability identify useful context descriptions system scaled refined larger scale experiments 
calvin calvin observes users browsing www 
provides means indexing consulted documents user current task context retrieving documents suggestions 
early prototype calvin discussed 
architecture redesigned dynamic multi agent environment variety software tools simultaneously observe analyze support user 
version calvin totally supports multiple users concurrently conducts background internet searches automatically generated queries 
wordsieve wordsieve learns user document access patterns generate term vector indices document storage retrieval 
algorithm builds persistent user profile corresponding user access patterns uses profile index individual documents identify similar contexts appropriate retrieval 
acceptable users algorithm needs learn relatively little explicit feedback 
practical information retrieval agent luxury pre analyzing entire text corpus 
considerations strongly influenced wordsieve design 
studying document user accesses wordsieve identifies words occur frequently periods time absent times 
wordsieve built layered competitive network words effectively compete maintain positions 
layer short term memory identifies words currently occurring frequently document stream significant 
second layer functions long term memory identifies words tend occur frequently broader periods time 
third layer identifies words occasionally cease occurring making candidates partitioning sets related documents 
words achieve appropriate values network constitute dictionary indexing querying retrieval 
initial tests wordsieve outperformed term frequency inverse document frequency generating vectors closely correlated vector representation search task user 
status direction additional details calvin wordsieve available 
initial experiments wordsieve promising integrating wordsieve context analysis mechanism calvin architecture enable full scale tests algorithm performs wild developing methods refined evaluations calvin including studies wordsieve generates useful queries possible methods enhancing wordsieve responsive occurrence terms 
help ignore spurious terms identify context relevant terms occurring specific browsing session looking terms occurred past relevant terms documents accessed
