example test significance level correctly confirm null hypothesis correct probability probability test erroneously declare hypothesis false 
significance level indicates proportion false negatives general difficult assess corresponding percentage false positives 
significance level testing follows 
suppose test intervals exponential interarrivals pass test significance level 
null hypothesis correct probability successes trials binomial distribution parameter
