michigan type systems xed length chromosome representation 
chromosome represents single rule systems develop special methods order deal disjunctive concepts 
pittsburgh approach situation reversed 
systems adapt disjunctive concepts naturally cost having complex chromosomes genetic operators 
dogma domain oriented genetic machine combines approaches 
supports distinct levels accompanying operators 
lower level dogma uses michigan type xed length genetic chromosomes manipulated mutation crossover operators 
lower level similar ga learner regal :10.1.1.54.8986
higher level chromosomes combined genetic families special operators merge break families
