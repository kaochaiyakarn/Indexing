cooperative multiagent robotic systems ronald arkin tucker balch mobile robot laboratory college computing georgia institute technology atlanta georgia teams robotic systems glance appear trouble worth 
simply build robot capable doing need 
reasons robots better ffl distributed action robots places time ffl inherent parallelism robots different things time ffl divide conquer certain problems suited decomposition allocation robots ffl simpler better agent team robots simpler comprehensive single robot solution doubt reasons 
unfortunately drawbacks particular regarding coordination elimination interference 
degree difficulty imposed depends heavily task communication control strategies chosen 
chapter study approach multiagent robotics context major real world systems ffl part arpa ugv demo ii program studied ways reactive control introduced coordination teams vehicles working dynamic unstructured hazardous environments
