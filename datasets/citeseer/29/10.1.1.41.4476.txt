consequently great deal research focusing exploitation new broadband communication devices provision new services large scale distributed systems internet 
technological methodological background developed conventional distributed systems fails scale applied problem providing large scale distribution 
happens researchers tried overcome problem bottom approach developing technology providing ad hoc support kind systems 
outcomes research proposal number new programming languages especially conceived internet characterized capability provide sort code mobility capability reconfigure dynamically run time binding software components application physical location computer network 
code mobility new approaches investigated capability provide code mobility language level :10.1.1.103.9804
novelty new approaches emphasis application code mobility large scale setting 
view technology addresses part problem 
software engineering taught software product come just technology 
higher level phases development process specification design play central role final success
