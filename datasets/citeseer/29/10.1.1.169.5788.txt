basic charging models packet forwarding packet forwarding service provided intermediate nodes source destination packet

section conceptual models charging packet forwarding service 
rst called packet purse model source packet charged second called packet trade model destination charged 
models combined provide solution 
packet purse model ppm model source packet pays packet forwarding service 
service charge distributed forwarding nodes way sending packet source loads su cient reach destination 
forwarding node acquires nuglets packet covers forwarding costs 
exact number nuglets charged forwarding nodes may depend things including amount energy forwarding operation current battery status forwarding node current 
packet nuglets forwarded discarded 
main advantage model stimulating cooperation may deter nodes sending useless data overloading network 
prevention overloading important issue mentioned available bandwidth node declines number nodes increases assuming tra exhibit locality properties 
main disadvantage di cult estimate number nuglets required reach agiven destination 
source estimates number packet discarded source loses investment 
source overestimate number 
surplus remains packet arrives destination kept destination destination provides information services pay 
source careful estimation packets nuglets inside lost transit due reasons bu er ow forwarding nodes 
system poorer poorer 
way problem users buy nuglets real money 
nuglets created international treaty organizations agencies 
mean providing services way earn nuglets 
preferred way appropriately choosing price 
packet trade model approach packet carry nuglets traded nuglets intermediate nodes 
intermediary buys previous nuglets rst intermediary receives packet free source sells destination nuglets 
way intermediary provided service forwarding packet increases total cost forwarding packet covered destination packet 
intermediary want buy packet price forwarding intermediary may try sell lower price intermediary packet 
advantage approach source number nuglets required deliver packet 
furthermore letting destination pay forthe packet forwarding approach applicable case multicast packets 
serious disadvantage approach directly deter nodes overloading network 
hybrid model previous models combined way source loads packet nuglets sending 
packet handled packet purse model runs nuglets

second approach number determined hop hop running second price auction neighbors forwarding node 
rst approach rst simple implement second generic easily added existing routing algorithm dsr aodv 
disadvantage exible forwarding node route demands nuglets xed hop charge packet packet dropped may contain nuglets demand 
note ad hoc routing algorithms route discovery mechanism obtain information greediness nodes various possible routes destination 
may help source hop charge select expensive route 
addition participating route discovery honestly reporting charge demands participate lies source may select route go node hop charge bene cial node 
means node able earn nuglets 
second approach complex requires forwarding node run auction neighbors 
message exchanges forwarding node bidding neighbors mean considerable overhead terms bandwidth latency 
alternative approach basedon software agents way node sends agent neighbors auctions normally sell object reason bidder highest bid selected winner 
model auction buy service provided nodes bidder willing provide service smallest charge selected winner 
modi cation change properties second price auction model consistently reversed rule model winner earns value second lowest bid standard second price auction winner pay thevalue second highest bid 
neighbors implements algorithm node auctions 
node runs auction locally agents appropriate neighbors 
packet sent winning agent 
disadvantage second approach combined routing algorithms nodes allowed multiple entries di erent hops destination routing tables tora 
algorithms forwarding nodes ppm auctions select actual hop list available hops 
advantage second approach step node demands lowest charge selected hop way approach tries minimize number nuglets spent delivery packets 
intuitively decreases probability packet dropped runs nuglets 
furthermore reasonable nodes charge forwarding operation dependent battery status 
particular node shortage battery may esteem battery power higher demand nuglets compensation energy spent forwarding 
way node decreases chances win auctions forward packets
