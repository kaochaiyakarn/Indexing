updating querying databases track mobile units wolfson prasad sistla sam chamberlain yesha consider databases representing information moving objects vehicles particularly location 
address problems updating querying databases 
specifically update problem determine location moving object database database location updated 
answer question proposing information cost model captures uncertainty deviation communication 
analyze dead reckoning policies policies update database location distance actual location database location exceeds threshold prevalent approach military applications cost model enables determine threshold propose dead reckoning policies compare performance simulation 
consider problem processing range queries database 
location update policies consider object moving prespecified route 
model database location storing database starting time starting location prediction locations object 
prediction speed object 
database location computed dbms subsequent point time 
method modeling database location originally introduced concept dynamic attribute method modified order handle uncertainty :10.1.1.51.4238
actual location moving object deviates database location due fact travel constant speed dead reckoning update policy dictates database update threshold th deviation send location speed update database 
note point time knows actual location database location compute current deviation 
speed dead reckoning sdr dead reckoning policy threshold th fixed duration trip 
introduce dead reckoning update policy called adaptive dead reckoning adr 
sense location attributes viewed constraint generalized tuple tuples satisfying constraint considered database 
constraint databases separately applied temporal see domain spatial domain see 
constraint databases framework implement proposed update policies query processing algorithm 
main problem communication tradeoffs replicating position information data replication somewhat related current research 
extends initially reported important ways :10.1.1.51.4238
introduce quantitative new probabilistic model method processing range queries 
contrast previous works took qualitative approach form may semantics queries 
second introduce uncertainty separate concept deviation 
previous update policies equipped distinguish uncertainty deviation
