efficient view maintenance data warehouses agrawal el abbadi singh department computer science university california santa barbara ca incremental view maintenance algorithms data warehouse derived multiple distributed autonomous data sources 
detailed framework analyzing view maintenance algorithms multiple data sources concurrent updates 
earlier approaches view maintenance presence concurrent updates typically require types messages compute view change due initial update compensate view change due interfering concurrent updates 
algorithms developed perform compensation locally information available data warehouse 
algorithm termed sweep ensures complete consistency view data warehouse presence concurrent updates 
previous algorithms incremental view maintenance required quiescent state data warehouse required exponential number messages terms data sources
