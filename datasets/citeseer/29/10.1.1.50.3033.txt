cost optimization decision support queries transient views subramanian shivakumar ibm santa labs ibm santa labs san jose ca san jose ca generation decision support applications capable processing huge amounts data require ability integrate reason data multiple heterogeneous data sources 
data sources differ variety aspects data models query languages support network protocols 
typically spread wide geographical area 
cost processing decision support queries setting quite high 
processing queries involves redundancies repeated access data source multiple execution similar processing sequences 
minimizing redundancies significantly reduce query processing cost
