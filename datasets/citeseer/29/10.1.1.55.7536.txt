web information system reasons structured collections text william cohen labs research park avenue florham park nj research att com degree information sources pre processed web information systems varies greatly 
search engines altavista little pre processing done knowledge integration systems complex site specific wrappers integrate different information sources common database representation 
describe intermediate models 
system information sources converted highly structured collection small fragments text 
queries structured collection text fragments approximated novel logic called whirl combines inference style deductive databases ranked retrieval methods information retrieval 
whirl allows queries integrate information multiple web sites requiring extraction normalization object identifiers keys operations conventional databases require equality tests keys approximated ir similarity metrics text 
experimental evidence showing information sources easily modeled whirl inferences logic accurate efficient 
different models systems designed access information web 
model called information retrieval ir model exemplified search engines lycos altavista 
model large portion web queried query language limited keyword searches single documents 
second model exemplified systems information manifold tsimmis :10.1.1.42.7670:10.1.1.38.7636
knowledge integration model supports complex database queries particular queries integrate information multiple web sites formulated 
current knowledge integration systems require extraction database information web relatively expensive process terms human engineering
