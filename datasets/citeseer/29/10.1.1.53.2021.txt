interpretation difficult representations typically highly distributed continuous 
continuous mean constructed scatter plot hidden unit activity space patterns obtained response various inputs examination scale reveal patterns broadly distributed space 
continuous representations naturally obtained input space activation dynamics continuous 
continuous representations appropriate 
task domains benefit discrete representations representations selected finite set alternatives
