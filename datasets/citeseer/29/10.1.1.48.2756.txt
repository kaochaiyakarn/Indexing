filters thresholds decide non important words system able generate kbs various sizes accuracy values tuning thresholds 
best combination depends texts category definition users preferences 
categorization phase faster processing required categorization phase important develop techniques 
addition idea discussed truncate query text text length web pages varies widely takes time extremely long page included search result :10.1.1.56.2257
order improve speed page text truncation useful takes little time truncate text 
system considers characters text 
text truncation reduces number distinct keywords facilitates faster processing 
reduce words extracted query text words lower frequency query significantly impact category decision 
remove words frequencies lower value total number distinct words tunable parameter 
set lower threshold higher number extracted words lower processing speed higher

kb size consists pair number records number distinct keywords 
number records smaller speed similarity calculation higher 
number distinct keywords smaller speed keyword matching keywords query text kb higher

results word stemming shows results categorization word stemming :10.1.1.56.2257
stemming improve accuracy reduces kb size

stemming algorithm adopt affect accuracy interesting evaluate stemming programs 
word stemming experiments significantly reduces kb size 
notice best threshold values depend text types web pages patent documents news articles category definition number categories exclusiveness 
interesting consider automatic detection best values thresholds 
possibility improvement section discuss possible improvements techniques 
causes wrong categorization experiments 
category definition web pages difficult assign category infoseek categories categories share topics :10.1.1.56.2257
example computer category internet category overlap computer related pages stanford digital library project homepage www stanford edu assigned categories 
furthermore web pages refer multiple topics assigned quite independent categories 
system able assign multiple categories page confidence value distribution similarity values categories evaluate accuracy viewpoint multiple categorization 
collection training data set experiments collected texts training data 
results experiments encouraging 
believe ir systems information organization functions categorization enable search information effectively comfortably
