submitted ieee transactions signal processing october equivariant adaptive source separation jean fran cardoso 
source separation consists recovering set independent signals mixtures unknown coefficients observed 
introduces class adaptive algorithms source separation implements adaptive version equivariant estimation henceforth called equivariant adaptive separation independence algorithms idea serial updating specific form matrix updates systematically yields algorithms simple parallelizable structure real complex mixtures 
importantly performance algorithm depend mixing matrix 
particular convergence rates stability conditions interference rejection levels depend normalized distributions source signals 
close form expressions quantities asymptotic performance analysis
