introduce new approach model selection performs better standard hold error estimation techniques cases 
basic idea exploit intrinsic metric structure hypothesis space determined natural distribution unlabeled training patterns metric detect empirical error estimates derived small labeled training sample trusted region empirically optimal hypothesis 
simple metric intuitions develop new geometric strategies detecting overfitting performing robust responsive model selection spaces candidate functions 
new metric strategies dramatically outperform previous approaches experimental studies classical polynomial curve fitting 
technique simple efficient applied function learning tasks
