promising approach emerged hierarchical reactive plans 
reactive plans qualified preconditions help select plans execution agent current high level goals tasks beliefs environment 
selecting high level plans execution leads subgoals hierarchical expansion reactive plans 
commonsense notion teamwork involves simple coordination american heritage dictionary defines cooperative effort members team achieve common goal
