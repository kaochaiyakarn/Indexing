common opinion literature show framework poses new challenges specially related need semantics conceptual global schema account query processing 
contribution show idea adopting conceptual data model expressing global schema query processing involved simplified framework usually considered literature 
particular surprising result semantics data integration system best described terms set databases single implies global view approach query processing intimately connected notion querying incomplete databases 
second contribution formalization notion correct answer data integration system conceptual global schema presentation query processing strategy able provide correct answers query posed system

conceptual data model conceptual model basis integration framework introduced section 
model incorporates basic features entity relationship er model extended subset constraints entities relationships :10.1.1.123.1085
characteristics considered sake simplicity domain attributes identification constraints added affecting results sections 
er schema collection entity relationship attribute definitions alphabet symbols 
alphabet partitioned set entity symbols denoted set relationship symbols denoted set attribute symbols denoted 
entity definition form define entity isa eh participates 
show surprising result due presence semantic conditions implicit conceptual schema general account set databases 
remind reader assume databases involved framework global databases source databases defined fixed infinite alphabet symbols 
order assign semantics data integration system mg start considering source database accessing data integration systems conceptual schemas age person member organization student enrolled university fig 

global schema example database source schema specify information content global schema database database global database said legal respect simply legal respect legal respect element set tuples assigns coherent set tuples computed associated query eb definition implies sources considered sound data provide integration system satisfy global schema necessarily complete :10.1.1.51.3293
possibility consider exact 
sources exact mapping global schema sources defined way source database element holds eb example 
shows global schema data integration system functional attribute student mandatory participation relationship enrolled enrolled member isa organization 
schema models persons members organizations students enrolled universities 
specifies student mandatory participation relationship enrolled legal database enrolled certain university 
key point said university accept legal databases differ university enrolled 
framework assume problem solved queries extracting data sources 
words assume functional attribute corresponding query implements suitable data cleaning strategy ensures source database tuple belongs similar condition holds functional attributes relationships 
interested reader referred details data cleaning techniques :10.1.1.31.109
second problem shows issue query answering incomplete information arises global view approach data integration 
existence multiple global databases data integration system implies query processing simply reduce evaluating query single database 
principles take possible legal global databases account answering query 
interesting observe different strategies simplify setting overcome problem 
case analogously previous easy accessing data integration systems conceptual schemas see global database considered formed data retrieved source 
data sources obey semantic conditions implicit conceptual global schema single database coherent global schema data integration system inconsistent 
implies query answering meaningless 
argue usual case autonomous heterogeneous sources data fit global schema approach restrictive sense data integration system inconsistent 
fact problem incomplete information overlooked current approaches explained observing traditional data integration systems follow mentioned simplifying strategies express global schema set plain relations consider sources exact see instance :10.1.1.1.5982:10.1.1.71.9387
contrary goal study general setting global schema expressed terms conceptual model sources considered sound necessarily complete 
result demonstrates case account multiple global databases results described section show process queries setting 
conclude section defining notion query posed data integration system 
query data integration system mg conjunctive query atoms symbols predicates illustrated section
