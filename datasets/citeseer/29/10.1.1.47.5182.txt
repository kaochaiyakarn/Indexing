object exchange heterogeneous information sources yannis papakonstantinou hector garcia molina jennifer widom department computer science stanford university stanford ca hector cs stanford edu address problem providing integrated access diverse dynamic information sources 
explain problem differs traditional database integration problem focus aspect information integration problem information exchange 
define object information exchange model corresponding query language believe suited integration diverse information sources 
describe model language integrate heterogeneous bibliographic information sources 
describe general purpose libraries implemented object exchange clients servers 
significant challenge facing database field years integration heterogeneous databases 
users want explore available information discovering sources browsing objects learning semantics objects components 
tools information discovery browsing allow humans ultimately software query sources interest request objects sources navigate objects exploring components ask questions meaning objects components 

mediators 
mediator program collects information sources processes combines exports resulting information :10.1.1.11.8981
example mediator program collects ibm yearly reports extracts key figures exports table yearly results 
second mediator take table combine stock price report produce trends analysis ibm
