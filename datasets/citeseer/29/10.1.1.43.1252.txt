problem essential scatter gather browsing paradigm fast document clustering effective cluster summarization 
previous document clustering generally concentrated algorithms running time quadratic collection size classic single linkage clustering algorithm 
quadratic running time clearly costly interactive manipulation collections envision containing thousands documents possibly requiring days months perform single clustering 
contrast linear time algorithms previously reduce time required minutes approximately documents minute sun microsystems sparcstation fast moderately large collections results broad word queries :10.1.1.34.6746
linear time clustering slow support interactive browsing large document collections 
particularly apparent considers applying scatter gather tipster collection darpa standard text retrieval evaluation contains quarters documents 
documents minute requires hours scatter far long considered interactive 
achieve interactive performance small constant time bound required scatter gather step 
implementation generating hierarchy observed cluster hierarchies natural outputs agglomerative clustering procedures 
procedures typically quadratic time step merge globally similar pair documents 
collections size tipster prohibitively slow preprocessing step 
propose different approach 
partitional clustering strategies buckshot fractionation cluster groups kn time :10.1.1.34.6746
partitional procedures easily generate hierarchy simply apply algorithm recursively group partition stopping individual documents 
branching factor partition entire collection groups kn time 
groups treated subcollection partitioned turn level recursion total items item exactly group level 
total cost perform clusterings level 
fact cluster user high frequency function words course discarded list 
size defined number non zero entries part listing topical terms truncated profile 
benefit truncation total amount storage required represent cluster hierarchy linear size collection 
internal nodes leaves storage required internal node constant 
meta summarization scatter gather employs cluster digest summarize cluster individual documents :10.1.1.34.6746
extend notion clusters meta documents follows 
recall cluster digest consists complementary components list topical words defined highest weight cluster list typical titles defined titles individuals similar cluster profile 
computation topical words depends profiles cluster members trivially extended clusters meta documents 
extending computation typical titles hand requires define notion title meta documents
