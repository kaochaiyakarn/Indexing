mining association rules item constraints ramakrishnan srikant vu rakesh agrawal ibm almaden research center harry road san jose ca almaden ibm com problem discovering association rules received considerable research attention fast algorithms mining association rules developed 
practice users interested subset association rules 
example may want rules contain specific item rules contain children specific item hierarchy 
constraints applied postprocessing step integrating mining algorithm dramatically reduce execution time 
consider problem integrating constraints boolean expressions presence absence items association discovery algorithm 
integrated algorithms mining association rules item constraints discuss tradeoffs 
taxonomies hierarchies items available 
example taxonomy shown 
taxonomy says jacket outerwear ski pants outerwear outerwear isa clothes taxonomies users usually interested generating rules span different levels taxonomy 
example may infer rule people buy outerwear tend buy hiking boots fact people bought hiking boots ski pants hiking boots 
generalization association rules algorithms finding rules described srikant agrawal han fu :10.1.1.144.4956
practice users interested subset associations instance containing item user defined subset items 
taxonomies set items may specified taxonomy descendants item 
output current algorithms filtered post processing step efficient incorporate constraints associations discovery algorithm 
consider constraints boolean expressions presence absence items rules

taxonomies enhancements apriori algorithm integrating item constraints apply directly algorithms mining association rules taxonomies srikant agrawal :10.1.1.144.4956
discuss cumulate algorithm 
algorithm adds ancestors item transaction transaction runs apriori algorithm extended transactions 
example taxonomy transaction replaced outerwear clothes shoes 
cumulate performs optimization including adding ancestors candidates extended transaction counting itemset includes item ancestor 
generating set selected items expensive elements include ancestor descendant function need find support ancestors descendants 
checking itemset satisfies expensive may need traverse hierarchy find item ancestor 
cumulate count candidates item ancestor support itemset support itemset ancestor 
cumulate checks candidates second pass candidates size 
subsequent passes apriori candidate generation procedure ensures candidate fast algorithm srikant agrawal similar cumulate uses sampling decrease number candidates counted :10.1.1.144.4956
contains item ancestor generated 
example itemset outerwear generated deleted property hold item constraints specified 
case need check candidate pass ensure candidates contain item ancestor
