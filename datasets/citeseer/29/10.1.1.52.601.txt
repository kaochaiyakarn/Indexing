segmenting simply connected moving objects static scene martin bichsel university zurich department computer science multimedia laboratory ch zurich switzerland email ifi ch new segmentation algorithm derived object background probability estimate exploiting experimental fact statistics local image derivatives show laplacian distribution 
objects simply connectedness included directly probability estimate leads iterative optimization approach implemented efficiently 
new approach avoids early thresholding explicit edge detection motion analysis grouping 
contribution type correspondence supported consortium visage object recognition applications objects interest moving background static stabilized 
motion segmentation enormously simplify subsequent object recognition steps 
detecting segmenting moving objects static scene important computer vision task
