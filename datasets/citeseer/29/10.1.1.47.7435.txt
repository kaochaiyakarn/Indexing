virtual time global states distributed systems department computer science university kaiserslautern germany distributed system characterized fact global state distributed common time base exist 
notion time important concept day life decentralized real world helps solve problems getting consistent population census determining potential causality events 
argue linearly ordered structure time adequate distributed systems propose generalized non standard model time consists vectors clocks 
clock vectors partially ordered form lattice 
timestamps simple clock update mechanism structure causality represented isomorphic way 
new model time close analogy minkowski leads interesting characterization global state problem
