improved heterogeneous distance functions randall wilson randy cs edu tony martinez martinez cs edu computer science department young university ut usa instance learning techniques typically handle continuous linear input values handle nominal input attributes appropriately 
value difference metric vdm designed find reasonable distance values nominal attribute values largely ignores continuous attributes requiring discretization map continuous values nominal values 
proposes new heterogeneous distance functions called heterogeneous value difference metric hvdm interpolated value difference metric ivdm value difference metric wvdm 
new distance functions designed handle applications nominal attributes continuous attributes
