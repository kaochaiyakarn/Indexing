object oriented database system logical oids oid index oidx necessary convert logical oid physical location 
temporal objectoriented database system toodb oidx contains timestamps object versions 
previous studied oidx performance relatively simple index 
studies shown oidx maintenance quite costly especially objects updates temporal oodb oidx needs updated time object updated 
convinced new index structure particularly suitable toodb requirements necessary
