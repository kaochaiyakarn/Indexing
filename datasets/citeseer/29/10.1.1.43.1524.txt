knowing behavioral strategy utility function employed agents common model assume rational take move maximizes payoff 
problem assumption agents different skills skills 
expert plays differently expert intermediate opponent 
expert opponent expected maximize utility making mistakes intermediate opponent expected perceive options making mistakes
