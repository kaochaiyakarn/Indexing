immune system self defining process self defining aspect immune system important feature immune system taken seriously works reviewed self identifying defining 
importance aspect pointed literature 
immune system considered self identifying defining process continuously monitor self discriminate self non self maintain identity materially 
essence immune system self defining process may traced back briefly argument immunity resides fundamental concept organism intrinsically entity striving harmony 
immunological process primarily activities established organism result secondary phenomena protect 
tauber immunology today eliminating non self main job immune system subordinate job included main job identifying defining maintaining self
