finite state transducers language speech processing mohri labs research finite state machines various domains natural language processing 
consider type transducers supports efficient programs sequential transducers 
recall classical theorems give new ones characterizing sequential string tostring transducers 
transducers output weights play important role language speech processing 
give specific study string weight transducers including algorithms minimizing transducers efficiently characterizations transducers admitting determinization corresponding algorithms 
applications algorithms speech recognition described illustrated
