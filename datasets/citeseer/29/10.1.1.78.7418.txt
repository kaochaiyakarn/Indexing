logic programming multi agent systems robert kowalski sadri department computing imperial college london fs doc ic ac uk october extension logic programming lp suitable rational component single agent reactive component encompass multi agent systems 
extension multi agent systems particular arguably brings lp main benefits object orientation including encapsulation 
modify earlier abductive proof procedure embed agent cycle 
proof procedure incorporates abduction definitions integrity constraints dynamic environment changes observed inputs 
definitions allow rational planning behaviour integrity constraints allow reactive type behaviour 
agent cycle provides resource bounded mechanism allows agent thinking interrupted agent record assimilate observations input execute actions output resuming thinking
