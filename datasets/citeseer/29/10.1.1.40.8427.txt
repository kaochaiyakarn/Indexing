fritz hohl time limited blackbox security protecting mobile agents malicious hosts fritz hohl institute parallel distributed high performance systems university stuttgart germany fritz hohl informatik uni stuttgart de mobile agent systems expected possible base platform electronic services framework see especially area electronic commerce 
application area security crucial aspect parties involved require confirmation parties break rules punished 
requirement fulfilled traditional non electronic commerce 
anonymity worldwide communication network ease automatic exploitation security gaps electronic applications necessary meet demand area commercial transactions done computers 
mobile agents entities consist code data control information thread states 
mobile agent systems platforms allow mobile agents migrate different nodes agent system 
time limited blackbox security mobile code systems designed standard cryptographic techniques encryption digital signatures 
reverse security issue protection mobile agent possible attacks malicious host new barely areas aspect important 
protection mobile agents malicious hosts viewpoint owner agent important protection host malicious agents 
see apart organisational solutions technical approaches solve problem special secure hardware exist far 
problem called problem malicious hosts estimated low :10.1.1.36.7636
presents approach solve aspects problem malicious hosts 
approach cost execution time communication bandwidth require time critical restrictions gives agent possibility security sensitive danger immediate exploitation sensitive data host 
rest organized follows section presents problem malicious hosts section describes existing approaches lists problems 
section explains blackbox protection solve problem malicious hosts section shortly describes blackbox approach called mobile cryptography 
manipulation interaction agents 
returning wrong results system calls issued agent illustrate attacks small purchase agent example 
purchase agent contains data code block 
entries data block may include central procedure called host time agent arrives look address home pda sweet pda money float flowers red address empty list int float address empty public void null

code code agent readable host 
section see approach try restore autonomy agent called blackbox approach 
existing approaches mentioned malicious host defined party able execute agent belongs party tries attack agent way 
means malicious hosts problem agents trust host advance 
case trust means owner knows hopes operator attack 
approaches see exist try circumvent problem potentially malicious hosts allowing agents move hosts :10.1.1.36.7636
approaches trust approach protect hosts agents allowing accept agents non trusted hosts 
problem approaches trust context absolute hide trusted node clear advance host trusted 
severely reduce number hosts agent migrate 
owner trusts big comes accounting may want see secret communication key 
context hard means analysis take time possible 
conversion algorithms called mess algorithms 
note approach assume impossible attacker analyse agent analysis simply takes time 
assumption lower bound time determined time interval large host fig 
agent migration agent host div mod fig :10.1.1.36.7636
code fragment fritz hohl agent applications host 
agent mess algorithms task mess algorithm generate new agent original agent differs code data representation yields results 
means specification agent executable agent 
agents consists executable code data 
effect strengthened complex variable expressions simple variables 
deposited keys protection information included agent attacker able break protection sooner 
encrypt parts agent identify information small important execution agent information trusted server 
idea agent request information parts keys trusted server indicating state agent 
example fig conversion functions public address bitstring public bitstring public money bitstring public address bitstring fig new variable access buy go fig original code fig converted code continue continue continue continue continue break loop fig :10.1.1.36.7636
deposited keys agent malicious host trusted host state key time limited blackbox security type keys numbers printed bold denote data interconnects statements 
numbers code attacker able analyse agent attack agent runtime 
trusted host deliver agent right state indicated 
course better algorithms examples demonstrate principles follow algorithm needs large parameter space order avoid dictionary attacks possible break protection running code may useful take parts agent put parts trusted nodes single algorithms may strong 
moment implementation approach exists complex framework needs lot modifications agent system 
currently finishing implementation combination code mess algorithms starting develop formal model mess effects able compute protection strength 
prevent blackbox testing attacks currently working extension blackbox mechanism allow agents authenticate hosts
