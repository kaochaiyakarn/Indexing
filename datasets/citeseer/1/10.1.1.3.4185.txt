spatial ip address assignment sensor networks data generated sensor nodes needs associated spatial location data sensed 
reasonable assumption nodes sensor network way determining location methods localization sensor networks developed 
tcp ip sensor networks propose spatial ip address assignment mechanism solve problem address assignment 
spatial ip address assignment sensor node uses spatial location construct ip address 
assume nodes aware spatial location address assignment requires central server communication sensor nodes

header compression energy scarce resource wireless sensor networks applications radio transmission expensive activity 
minimum size udp ip header bytes bytes sensor data value sent udp ip header overhead cause large amounts energy spent transmitting header 
sensor networks sensor nodes assumed cooperate common goal nodes share common context 
reason nodes agree specific udp ip header field values sensor data udp datagrams 
headers compressed simple pattern matching techniques 
example nodes part ip subnet need transmit full ip addresses headers packets sourced destined nodes sensor network 
similarly utilizing small range udp ports sensor data datagrams transmitting full bit port numbers required packets containing sensor data 
tcp connections standard header compression techniques specific requirements sensor network place additional challenges

segment caching packet loss detection dtc uses segment caching achieve local retransmissions 
memory limitations sensor nodes vital performance mechanism find appropriate way nodes select segments cache 
initial analysis suggest desirable outcome selection algorithm segments cached nodes close receiver possible nodes closer receiver cache segments lower sequence numbers 
achieve node caches tcp segment highest sequence number seen takes extra care cache segments dropped path receiver 
feedback link layer supports positive acknowledgments infer packet drops hop 
tcp segment forwarded link layer acknowledgment received may lost transit segment locked cache indicating overwritten tcp segment higher sequence number 
locked segment cleared cache acknowledgment acknowledges cached segment received segment times 
avoid retransmissions original tcp sender dtc needs respond faster packet drops regular tcp 
dtc uses ordinary tcp mechanisms detect packet loss time outs duplicate acknowledgments
