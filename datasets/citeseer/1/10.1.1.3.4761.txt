despite increasing attention research community hundreds thousands users behavior systems real workload actual users poorly understood 
promising current file sharing systems quickly gaining popularity bittorrent suprnova system 
attempt understand operation file sharing means detailed measurements operation bittorrent assess quality respect aspects download speed availability 
addition propose improvements existing architecture 
high level robustness click download user interface important factors success bittorrent 
bittorrent different networks important respects 
include search mechanism relies central directory search facilities provided web sites suprnova org maintain lists files currently available downloading 
secondly employs file level sharing policy common directory level sharing policy 
thirdly provides bartering mechanism clients downloading file introduces certain level fairness system

concerning popularity systems fasttrack largest file sharing community overnet stay far bittorrent rapidly gaining popularity 
dc system fully exploit social relationships online friendships communities 
dc users connect hub able share download files 
concept search hubs minimum file sharing requirements individual hubs combination cumbersome interface reflected low popularity system 
popularity gnutella falls quickly grew years ago original flat flooding design scale 
fasttrack architecturally advanced system availability due utilization supernodes create temporary indexing servers allowing network scale 
systems try ensure availability means full gnutella partial overnet distribution responsibility shared files 
manually maintained suprnova site scale definition weakest points bittorrent 
bittorrent leader download performance 
lack searching functionality compensated advanced download distribution protocol leaves competitors far 
overnet takes completely opposite approach offering powerful searching capabilities queue scheduling downloads waiting times exceeding days 
big difference bittorrent systems table file sharing policy 
bittorrent provides file level sharing scope allowing users download files downloaded 
lack archive functionality results relatively short content lifetimes 
systems kazaa directory level sharing policy files located particular directory accessible long client stays connected 
temporary drop file popularity remove system 
filtering shared content order create pollution free system process hardly automated 
kazaa users familiar problems caused fake files floating system 
hash code verification combination hash databases com limit number fake files fasttrack network allow user identify correct files

bittorrent improvements section discuss improvements bittorrent suprnova 
concerns fact bittorrent suprnova partially distributed central elements sources availability problems 
thing bittorrent peers share actual content 
situation improved making peers share indexes content content integrity checksums peer ip numbers 
requires infrastructure trust reputation management message validation prevent malicious peers spreading false information 
fortunately accomplished public private keys merkle hash trees techniques 
functionality suprnova org may reduced validation correct content moderators public private keys 
merkle hash trees single sha value check validity content indexes peer ip numbers 
gossip style protocol suited actual distribution control information 
second improvement concerns download speed content lifetime benefit better cooperation network awareness 
download speed enhanced having peers keep track performance information past download speeds latencies peers making share exploit information 
currently bittorrent trial error select peers bartering flash crowd thousands peers 
failing exploit peers exceptionally long missed opportunity increase availability performance information 
course exchange information entails overhead 
content lifetime improved dramatically sharing old content rewarded
