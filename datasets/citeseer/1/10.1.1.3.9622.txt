observed information workers switch concurrent tasks

identified desirable properties task management systems including fast task switching fast task resumption easy mental task context 
virtual desktop managers built exhibits properties 
task management systems typically provide efficient way switching set windows applications set basic form task switching 
workers may switch tasks manner significant portion task switching caused external interruptions 
czerwinski cutrell horvitz cutrell czerwinski czerwinski sought understand influence interruptions task switching information workers order design user interface tools assist users recover interruptions 
motivated re examine task switching task management design opportunities face growing popularity larger display multiple monitor configurations 
informal study users shift larger display surfaces leave applications running associated windows open 
example observed single display users tend keep average windows open dual monitor users keep triple monitor users keep windows open average users 
larger study required verification results significant trend suggests opportunity design innovation windows task management dealing larger numbers concurrent windows fundamentally natural effective experience

clicking group tab restores windows group brings foreground 
right clicking tab offers context menu additional group actions see 
figures depict vertical bar style groupbar configured horizontal vertical form factors just standard windows taskbar

groupbar design 
groupbar backwards compatible key addition groupbar root interaction functionality existing windows taskbar drag interaction bar tiles 
drag interaction defined tiles original taskbar users choose grouping functionality groupbar regular taskbar 
grouping additional grouping information primarily conveyed subtle changes shape surrounding coloration grouped window tiles green group tab high contrast unifier

shows earlier design additional tab embedded button 
price paid groupbar backward compatibility unobtrusiveness users need grouping capabilities grouping feature may low 
plan address issue different approaches 
bubble help appear situations grouping functionality useful example user performed series different window minimization restoration actions 
possibility explore algorithms automatic grouping analysis user ongoing windowing activity example making automatic group set windows highly incident screen 
automation runs risk intrusive configured carefully

design features additional collapse button group 

overloading drag interactions groupbar drag interaction derived drag interactions windows file management toolbar customization functions microsoft office 
porting drag interaction generally straightforward special adaptations 
dragged window tile appended tile group inserted tiles groups groupbar drag drop design simultaneously support grouping re ordering semantics 
mentioned walkthrough section groupbar accomplished distinguishing dropping groups dropping outside group altering shape location 
group insertion curved placed tile grouping occur non group rearrangement straight centered gap tiles 
shows different shapes visually distinguish different operations drop targets closely located 
enabling multiple main reasons curved window tile design compare design shown 
help users acquire individual drop target areas chose decouple target surfaces visual location symbols 
shows screen space containing straight line small allow users acquire space efficiently 
groupbar solves problem distributing screen space tile centers evenly adjacent targets independent symbols appear 
experience assignment target surfaces positive benefit larger minimum drop areas outweigh lack absolute positional precision 
tile center tile center left insert right bar fragment possible 
order allow users easily acquire drop position insertion groupbar distributes activation surface evenly various possibilities 

maximizing groups window layout philosophy groupbar allow users operate groups windows single unit 
existing windows design left click behavior tile button changes depending state window 
example window minimized state restore option minimize restored 
designed optimize button allow invocation different functions serially single control surface 
familiarity efficiency brought analogous facility forward group tab group minimized left clicking group tab restores windows brings forward 
group restored left clicking group tab minimizes windows 
operation translate immediately individual window tiles groups maximize function 
maximizing individual window group overlap problematic useful 
groupbar extends analogy twist creating layout group operation serves maximize collective space taken group maximizing space taken individual window 
ways accomplish type cooperative maximization groupbar currently allows users choose selection predefined layouts recognize users define spatial layouts 
groupbar context menu allows users arrange windows group predefined layouts 
user uses triple monitor display layout extends screens 

handling large numbers windows number displayed windows increases type bar interface eventually run space 
original windows taskbar deals issue making users page sets tiles small arrow handles 
approach large number potentially relevant tiles difficult access groupbar implements different approach leverages knowledge groups 
groupbar runs space groups collapse space efficient representation order room prevent bar overflowing figures 
groups collapsed picked basis 
believe preferable agglomeration application strategy implemented current version windows 
order allow users collapsing functionality reduce visual clutter bar overflows users manually collapse expand groups group context menu 
alternative strategy groupbar users deal large numbers windows creating additional bar instances 
additional bars added add new bar command groupbar context menu 
new bars created empty 
user position newly created bar edge monitor populate described drag drop mechanism 
allowing users place window tiles groups widely separated screen areas additional bars allow users leverage spatial memory heavily 
paging buttons collapsed group collapsed group taskbar overflow vs 
collapsed groups groupbar
