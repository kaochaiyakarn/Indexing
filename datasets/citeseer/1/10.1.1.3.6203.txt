note service application directly involved discovery procedure interface required see protocol description details 
additionally client application chooses discovery modes service providers service type located destination area shall discovered service provider area satisfy requesting client application 
service bindings sd components store information service providers lists called service bindings 
service binding associates type service service id ip address corresponding service provider 
context location service discovery service bindings contain information geographic position service provider 
service bindings created result registration procedure local server application due service advertisement remote service provider 
furthermore server applications assign service bindings limited lifetime 
case geocasting service advertisements mobile ad hoc environments proactive method limited lifetime allows influence spatial temporal resolution advertised information 
protocol phases approach geographic addressing forwarding control messages depending protocol state 
forwarding service requests depends availability fitting service bindings discovery mode particular discovery procedure 
forwarding service replies depends addressing mode 
protocol divided phases brief receiving message checking lbm forwarding rules ttl expiration packet duplicate detection avoiding broadcast effect message leaving forwarding zone 
making decision message processing due message type service bindings discovery mode

scenario gas station node advertises service area oncoming traffic node location 
test node service request region node 
benefit reply service requests propagate hop hop addressed destination region intermediate nodes right entering proactive zone wanted service provider 
replying intermediate node stops forwarding service request network load decreases discovery procedure faster 
addition method leads second service reply cause creation corresponding service binding reported requesting application

combination proactive reactive strategy hybrid approach leads certain advantages context inter vehicle communication highway city scenarios 
firstly applying proactive method regions high request rate service provider clients efficient strategy 
time clients want able initiate discovery located outside proactive zone service provider 
secondly replying service requests intermediate nodes border server proactive zone save bandwidth accelerate discovery procedure
