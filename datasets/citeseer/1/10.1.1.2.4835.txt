phototoc automatic clustering browsing personal photographs john platt mary czerwinski microsoft research microsoft way redmond wa microsoft com presents photo table contents phototoc system helps users find digital photographs collection photographs 
phototoc browsing user interface uses overview detail design 
detail view temporally ordered list user photographs 
overview user collection automatically generated image clustering algorithm clusters creation time color photographs 
phototoc tested users photographs browsers 
searching images phototoc subjectively rated easier browsers 
result shows automatic organization personal photographs facilitates efficient satisfying search 
photographs digital camera convenient low cost easy user generate photographs year 
flood photographs presents user interface challenge user find photographs collection 
previous image browsing search management largely concentrated solving problem user interacting large impersonal possibly annotated image database 
unfortunately lessons learned problem may carry searching personal photographs 
interacting impersonal databases users memories photographs personal collection 
users reluctant spend effort annotating images images stored small shallow hierarchy folders computer 
users spend large amount effort browsing tools searching disorganized collections photographs 
issues studied previous user studies performed users photographs folder structures 
propose users interact personal photographs image browser automatically organizes user images 
photo table contents phototoc browser personal digital photographs uses clustering algorithm automatically generate table contents user personal photograph collection 
clustering algorithm segments stream photographs events analyzing creation time photographs color histograms 
phototoc automatically chooses representative image cluster place brent field table contents

screen shot phototoc user interface demo phototoc user interface available web research microsoft com autoalbum ex html algorithms phototoc attempts identify events user collection 
identifying events pure image information difficult 
digital cameras time stamp photograph image created 
unfortunately time stamps incorrect due improperly set camera clock 
users scanned photographs contain photo creation time 
file creation date file modification date filename order photographs extracting events difficult true creation time missing 
cases creation time missing corrupt phototoc uses order photographs plus color information photographs identify events :10.1.1.10.7709
digital photographs ordered time exact creation time unavailable adding color information sufficient identify events 
different clustering algorithms applied user collection photographs 
time clustering creation time cluster photographs 
content clustering creation time order photographs color information cluster 
time clustering preferred data reliable content clustering backup algorithm 
clustering algorithms goal time clustering detect noticeable gaps creation time 
cluster defined photographs falling noticeable gaps 
gaps assumed correspond change event 
time gap detection adaptive compares gap local average temporally nearby gaps 
gap considered change event longer local gap average 
time gaps wide dynamic range gap detection algorithm operates logarithmically transformed gap times 
time clustering sorts photographs creation time 
gi time difference picture picture sorted list gn considered gap events longer local log gap average log gn log gn suitable threshold chosen empirically log window size chosen 
refers photograph ends collection term ignored denominator decremented ignored term 
effect equation compares gap local geometric average gap times declares new event difference large 
algorithm adaptively determines gap events new previous versions time clustering fixed threshold :10.1.1.10.7709
phototoc combines time content clustering creation times reliable 
signal unreliable creation time time clustering yields large clusters 
phototoc uses signal combine time content kinds clustering 
phototoc extracts creation time digital image 
time unavailable considered corrupt jan file creation time 
images sorted time clustering algorithm applied images 
time clusters large images content clustering applied large cluster produces number smaller clusters 
number content clusters number photographs large cluster rounded nearest integer 
choice cluster number yields zoom factor detail view approximately

average table mean satisfaction scores participants point likert scale strongly disagree strongly agree boldface marks significant differences 
discussion completion time data questionnaire data provide initial evidence superiority photo toc browsers studied certain individual questionnaire items revealed statistically significant differences browsers 
lack reliable performance advantage due limited number users user study limits statistical power comparisons 
interesting image search behaviors identified user study 
example observed subjects quite determining approximate time picture taken 
hypotheses wrong probably cue target image lead users garden path searches strongly believed correct 
example participant misrecognized target place different lake caused look target wrong month 
theories failed subjects resort serial search effectively scrolling entire database forward backward 
addition observed participants return category items multiple times held strong mistaken belief date event image 
multiple return behavior noticeable folders browser user descended folder hierarchy repeatedly 
participants quite frustrating confirms research shown searching hierarchies problematic fairly shallow hierarchies 
analogous interesting combine content image retrieval image browsing help users find photographs confused photograph fits context :10.1.1.39.4526
strong difference organizational behavior noted professional high consumer photographers casual photographers 
serious photographers due long history pictures large databases images built categorical hierarchy memorized user 
casual photographers fewer defined categories 
serious photographers folder system effectively minimal incorrect hypotheses reject software tool didn support rich folder structure 
casual photographers grateful sensible organizational guidance system provides 
phototoc redesigned allow switch table contents view folder view 
users overwhelmed incoming flood digital photographs 
starting demand automatic organization tools specifically systems automatically group photographs albums clusters 
presents photo toc example automatic organization tool 
phototoc system automatically clusters photographs allows user browse collection overview detail view 
compare phototoc image browsers performing user study users photographs folder organization 
study allows objectively compare traditional folder browsing user interfaces specialized image browsing user interfaces utilize various forms automatic organization 
user study showed automatic organization images combined suitably designed ui subjectively satisfying browse standard browsing interfaces leverage user organization 
automatic organization sacrifice browsing performance 
increased user preference collections photographs 
consumers higher user preference may important improved search performance 
automatic organization practical management technique personal photographic collections 
observed differences autoalbum phototoc main study show simply automatically organizing personal photographs 
autoalbum phototoc underlying automatic algorithm produced different satisfaction results due differing user interface designs 
adequate simply design automatic organization algorithms vacuum 
automatic organization algorithm development coupled iterative interface design user studies order truly useful
