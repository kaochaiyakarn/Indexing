automatic discovery semantic structures html documents mukherjee yang tan ramakrishnan department computer science state university new york stony brook stony brook ny ram cs sunysb edu template driven html documents posses implicit fixed schema denoting concepts relationships hierarchical fashion 
discovering schema remains relatively unexplored problem 
exploiting key observation semantically related items html documents exhibit spatial locality develop algorithm automatically partitioning tree semantic structures expose implicit schema 
growing number web sites maintained content management software large number web pages machine generated templates
