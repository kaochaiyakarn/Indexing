temporal spatial representation 
temporal representations need support various granularities alternatively represent time relationship service begins service 
common temporal granularities include seconds minutes hours days weeks months years 
approaches capturing granularities relationships finer groups previously offered 
temporal database literature defined terms non decomposed unit time time stamp lifespan event interval

security trust security trust foundational properties electronic service provision 
issues surrounding services outlined 
discuss possible representations topics 

security 
security increasingly viewed mandatory component facilitating electronic commerce 
alleviates concerns relating identity privacy alteration repudiation information transferred parties 
commonly think sullivan edmond ter hofstede wire security pertains request delivery channels service especially payment obligation service requestor 
security protocols secure sockets layer widespread role 
common approaches security organisations involve implementation public key infrastructure pki 
believe individual aspects service descriptions secured 
think service provider provides distinct descriptions retail wholesale clients description normally include different price 
concept similar visibility rules 
alternatively multiple advertisements generated service provider access controls applied type requestor accessing information 
security decidedly complex property context sub services 
propose questions 
client interacts service authenticates authenticate sub services 
require security certificates validate aggregations compositions sub services 
secure service composed service 
securing discovery service may alternative 
implications service sub services require security don 
happens differing policies respect client information 
express security surrounding client information service requestor 
constitutes infringement security promise 
managed penalty payment removal composition 

trust 
easy philosophical discussing trust 
humans trust subjective manner 
useful discussion trust offered suggested trust reinforcing attribute balances perceived risk cost benefit 
concerns service provision process 
trust mutual service provider doesn trust service requestor vice versa exclusive service provider trusts service requestor service requestor doesn trust provider 
model information flow systems mutual distrust offered 
service requestors largely view trust perspectives trust intentions service provider trust competence service provider 
reputation mechanisms attempt embody trust 
mechanisms offered address issues alteration electronic marketplaces 
implementation reputation mechanisms may useful concepts non electronic service provision may prove useful 
people tend satisfied acting group able increasingly trust service provider 
questions arise respect trust service provision 
represent trust service providers service requestors particular context 
question arises definition reputation amount trust inspired particular person specific setting domain interest 
decentralised system knowledge relating trust distributed particularly changes perception trust service 
party 
trust composition service composed sub services 
external party validate service provide level reputation previous interactions 
implications penalties parties 
access past performance service provider reduce perceived risk service requestor 

ownership rights provision goods usually results change ownership service provider service requestor 
services don involve transfer ownership 
service providers typically intellectual property associated provision process 
service requestors limited set rights associated service 
rights provide degree control request consumption service 
rights available service requestors services include 
right comprehend service requestors able question provider intention better understanding service 
right retract advertised service offer refined service contract negotiation service provider service requestor service requestor choose request instance service 
service requestor maintains right request service service provider 
right premature termination requestors may ability prematurely terminate service 
service provider may continue provision service movie continues play get walk may choose apply form penalty partial consumption 
common mobile phone industry penalties apply early termination mobile phone plan contracts 
right suspension interrupting delivery consumption service act useful method extending service provision process 
example suspension asking deliver holidays 
correspondingly right resumption continues delivery consumption previously suspended service 

non functional properties non functional properties numerous operations services 
service life cycle controlled service provider conception service longer offered 
typically involves definition creation advertisement invocation 
aspects form part general evolution service 
service defined descriptions generated 
descriptions referred advertisements offers normally published catalogue 
matchmaking conducted catalogues search criteria provided requestor descriptions service providers 
currently service descriptions primarily static insufficient allow detailed refinement occur service catalogue 
services consequently descriptions may require modification result interactions service requestors service providers surrounding environment 
sullivan edmond ter hofstede 
discovery mentioned section consider discovery process finding candidate service providers 
include refinement requestor understanding service 
service catalogues currently maintain lists service providers categorised proprietary classification schemes 
non functional properties largely restricted temporal spatial address availability request channel telephone number possibly geographic region 
temporal spatial availability request delivery channels quality service rights requestor service settlement models charging styles security trust currently provided catalogues requestors 
inclusion non functional properties published description allows detailed refinement occur service catalogue 
example requestor located canada wishes discover service provides stock quotes hong kong stock exchange 
requestor wants ensure non functional properties addressed provider software developed iso quality standard request delivery channel web settlement model subscription charging style unit measure time granularity monthly payment dollars information minutes old username password security required access service trust service provider fact greater people currently utilise service right terminate service months weeks notice 
non vague service requestors type service discovery currently possible 
hoped level description matchmaking reduce need contact providers discover requestor requirements match supplied service 
publishers may wish target specific catalogues detailed description whilst providing high level overview catalogues 

substitution substitution uses accurate service descriptions allow rational optimisation sub services composition 
services combining sequentially may easy conceptualise 
service may electronic news report service electronic weather report 
try outsource difficulties arise 
may offered usa chile 
pretty useless live australia pretty useless available weekdays weekends 
virtual service builders want configure composite service non functional properties contributing services examined carefully 
discussion raises notion substitutability context composition 
software engineering established rules substitution function 
rules captured approach known coincidentally programming contract 
may substitute function weaker preconditions stronger postconditions 
service 
suppose time past composed configuration contains encounter potential service safe assume available weekdays available days week things equal substitute newer 
may anticipate number substitution guidelines 
may substituted provided cheaper spatially available temporally available rules may compared weakening preconditions example service geographically available essentially weaker conditions attached 
properties may associated concept postcondition 
example service stronger consumer rights may substituted weaker obligations 

composition composition way defining new service 
static dynamic composition requires accurate detailed understanding services involved 
composition produces tightly coupled integration sub services ensure value added sum individual services 
composer services discovery substitution integral 
discovery provides opportunity determine service providers included composition whilst substitution useful existing compositions sub service needs replaced 
lets look example 
entity determines compose new service provides hotel car rental bookings 
appropriate hotel reservation service vehicle reservation service 
new service exhibit non functional properties provide single settlement model restricted spatial availability accommodation car hire france restricted service requestors australia accommodation rated greater stars vehicles need restricted carrying greater people 
composing entity needs discover services meet specified criteria 
undertake dynamic manner sufficient functional non functional information included published description 

management rich repositories service metadata provide opportunity monitoring controlling operations occur metadata discovery substitution composition execution 
existing service management architectures support composition include aurora 
suggest service management architecture aims monitor control service life cycle operations need recognise operations means rich service description language 
system need 
systems may relied establish behaviour service delivered sullivan edmond ter hofstede consistent service specified contract highly important issue 
conformance may legal consequences 
demonstrated examination trace service properly delivered 
additionally service management repositories offer opportunities development comparative tools evaluate services side side capable tracking evolution particular service type service 
services evolve consequently descriptions reflect metamorphosis 
evolution service result interactions requestors service composers changes environment surrounds service need alter functionality impetus changing constraints non functional properties service 
mechanisms implement non functional properties security trust channels evolve standards relevant domains 
service evolution constrained existing commitments service providers delivering service 
need administer evolving service descriptions questions need include expiry conditions temporal constraints description 
provides mechanism updating cached descriptions 
similar mechanism provided html metadata 

whilst acknowledging importance service functionality attempted highlight issues associated non functional service properties 
taken view service description complete non functional aspects expressed 
believe ability richly accurately describe services applicability areas electronic service discovery substitution composition management 
increased level service property information facilitate thorough decision making service requestor 
motivated everyday services surround ways engage 
believe historical interactions social economic commercial services offer strategic insight success electronic service initiatives
