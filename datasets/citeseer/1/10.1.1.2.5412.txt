attentive user interface paradigm important humancomputer interaction 
human attention system sensitive various methods notification traditional design involves compromise guesswork 
today world users want notified multiple sources information engaged tasks 
notification systems interfaces specifically designed support user access additional digital information sources secondary current activities 
interfaces especially examples web page advertisements animated software agents ineffective distracting abandoned ignored brief 
believe dissatisfaction results incorrect estimates user task prioritization design time 
consequently information introduced inappropriate times unsuitable presentation choices
