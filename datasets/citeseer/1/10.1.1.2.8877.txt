decentralized semantics classification resources definition vocabularies essential leveraging metadata creation fostering semantic interoperability reuse conceptualizations 
legacy information sharing systems typically support static sets centrally imposed predefined schemas

desirable may users come schemas bottom manner severely global semantic interoperability search capabilities ensure optimal precision recall searching data items referred large variety terms 
answer question twofold including schema inheritance semantic gossiping mechanisms 
schema inheritance provides basic schema reusability interoperability capabilities 
social networks expect popularity schemas follow scale free preferential attachment laws small subset schemas gain popularity remain mainly confidential :10.1.1.25.5619
allowing users derive new schemas known base schemas implicitly foster interoperability reusing sets conceptualizations belonging base schemas

grid system uses grid system physical layer 
grid principles distributed hash tables dht :10.1.1.38.1850
dht approach grid associates peers data keys key space partitions underlying distributed data structure 
peer responsible part key space maintains additional routing information forward queries requests 
constraining general applicability binary keys 
grid peers refer common underlying tree structure order organize routing tables 
assume tree binary 
fundamental limitation generalization grid ary structures introduced simplify presentation 
peer associated leaf binary tree 
leaf corresponds binary string 
peer associated path 
search peer stores prefix length set peers property binary string bit inverted 
means level tree peer peers pertain peer subtree level enables implementation prefix routing efficient search 
cost storing routing tables associated maintenance cost scalable proportional depth underlying binary tree 
peer stores set data items 
binary key key calculated order preserving hash function 
key prefix exclude temporarily data items stored peer set data items key matches proper subset 
addition peers maintain peers having path replicas 
grid supports basic operations retrieve key searching certain key retrieving associated data item insert key value storing new data items 
grid uses binary tree retrieve key intuitively efficient log measured terms messages required resolving search request balanced tree 
skewed data distributions show due probabilistic nature grid approach expected search cost measured number messages required perform search remains logarithmic independently grid structured 
important allows apply simple order preserving hashing functions metadata annotations may lead non uniformly distributed key distributions 
grid uses order preserving hash function compute keys define association peers grid prefix range queries arbitrary granularity epfl technical report ic efficiently log prefix

insert key value grid general update functionality provides probabilistic guarantees consistency efficient highly unreliable replicated environments log replication factor 
semantic support elaborate handles creation indexing rdf triples schemas

structured overlay network allows implement application specific addressing space 
introduce grid specific uri schemes grid resources grids schema elements

resolving queries simplest query may pose system consist triple pattern bound variable query retrieving parts triples epfl technical report ic value subject predicate object 
example rdql query select grid return predicates annotate data item 
call query native query 
native queries resolved routing message grid infrastructure

reception query checks local database sends back set triples matching query turn parses answer displays result 
process generates log messages log messages resolve grid entry plus message answer 
native queries literals searches value property resolved exactly way start hashing literal order get corresponding key 
generally triple patterns consist expressions subject predicate object replaced variables may bound 
resolves triple patterns differently depending number unbound variables contain unbound variables triple patterns retrieve triples stored system implying log messages 
unbound variables triple patterns standard native queries may resolved method described 
unbound variable triple patterns resolved issuing native query predicate query may second bound expression triple patterns 
query issued include predicates order query destination filter triples correctly 
zero unbound variable triple patterns constant require resolution 
triple patterns powerful primitives support expressive query languages

semantic interoperability previously mentioned believe lack semantic interoperability critical threat large scale semantic networks 
detail mechanisms take advantage order foster semantic interoperability 
schema inheritance users freely derive new categories existing ones 
impose new class representing subcategory subclasses base category class 
rdfs subclassof semantics implies subcategory automatically inherit properties defined base category definition property ranges instances subclass instances base class 
additionally subcategories may introduce set original properties directly related subclass 
provides example epfl technical report ic category annotating jpeg files derived generic category image files 
process course applied recursively sense subcategory may turn serve super category new derivation creating complex hierarchies categories classes popular base schemas 
subcategories subsume base categories subcategories category may instances base category 
particular searches property belonging base category automatically affect subcategories 
create sets semantically interoperable schemas properties shared derivations potentially popular base schema
