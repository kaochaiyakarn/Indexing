major difference cbir systems lies processing stages selecting neighboring target images image clustering major components clue 
typical cbir system bypasses stages directly outputs sorted results display feedback stage 
suggests clue designed independent rest components information needed clue sorted similarities 
implies clue may embedded typical cbir system regardless image features sorting method feedback 
result subsections focus discussion general methodology clue assume similarity measure 
neighboring target images selection mathematically define neighborhood point need choose measure distance 
images distance defined similarity measure larger value indicates smaller distance dissimilarity measure smaller value indicates smaller distance 
simple algebraic operations convert similarity measure dissimilarity measure loss generality assume distance images determined symmetric dissimilarity measure name distance images simplify notation 
propose simple methods select collection neighboring target images query image 
fixed radius method frm takes target images fixed radius respect query image number neighboring target images determined 

nearest neighbors method chooses nearest neighbors seeds 
nearest neighbors seed 
neighboring target images selected distinct target images seeds nearest neighbors 
distance metric methods generate similar results proper parameters andr 
non metric distances especially triangle inequality satisfied set target images selected methods quite different regardless parameters 
due violation triangle inequality distance images huge close query image

weighted graph representation spectral graph partitioning data representation typically step solve clustering problem 
field computer vision types representations widely 
called geometric representation data items mapped real normed vector space 
graph representation 
emphasizes pairwise relationship usually short geometric interpretation 
working images geometric representation major limitation requires images mapped points real normed vector space 
restrictive constraint 
example region algorithms image viewed collection regions 
number regions may vary images 
regions mapped certain real normed vector space general impossible images distance images metric case embedding feasible 
distances images non metric reasons 
adopts graph representation neighboring target images 
set images represented weighted undirected graph nodes represent images edges formed pair nodes non negative weight wij edge indicating similarity nodes function distance similarity nodes images distance images define wij scaling parameter needs tuned get suitable locality property

graph representation clustering naturally formulated graph partitioning problem 
graph theoretic algorithms uses normalized cut ncut algorithm image clustering 
roughly speaking ncut method attempts organize nodes groups group similarity high similarity low 
compared spectral graph partitioning methods average cut average association ncut method empirically shown relatively robust image segmentation 
ncut method recursively applied get clusters 
leads questions subgraph divided 
process 
simple heuristic 
time subgraph maximum number nodes partitioned random selection tie breaking 
process terminates bound number clusters reached ncut value exceeds threshold finding representative images ultimately system needs image clusters user 
typical cbir system displays certain numbers top matched target images user system able provide intuitive visualization clustered structure addition retrieved target images 
reason propose twolevel display scheme 
level system shows collection representative images clusters cluster 
second level system displays target images cluster specified user 
questions remain organize clusters 
find representative image cluster 
organization clusters described section 
second question define representative image cluster image similar images cluster 
statement mathematically illustrated follows 
graph representation images affinity matrix collection image clusters cm partition representative node image ci arg max ci ci wjt 
basically cluster pick image maximum sum cluster similarities 
organization clusters tree generated numbers denote size corresponding clusters 
recursive ncut partition essentially hierarchical divisive clustering process produces tree 
example shows tree generated recursive 
ncut divides 
nodes second ncut partitions 
divided larger 
fourth ncut applied gives final clusters leaves andc 
example suggests trees natural organization clusters 
tree organization may misleading user guarantee correspondence tree semantic structure images 
furthermore organizing image clusters tree structure significantly complicate user interface 
employ simple linear organization clusters called traversal ordering arrange leaves order binary tree traversal left child goes 
order clusters produced ncut iteration decided arbitration rule clusters generated ncut andd bethe minimal distance query image images left child left child 
traversal ordering arbitration rule query image leftmost leaf cluster containing query image minimum distance assigned left child 
sake consistency images cluster organized ascending order distances query image
