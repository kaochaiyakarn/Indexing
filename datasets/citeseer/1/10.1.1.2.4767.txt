web frontier term frontier refer set dangling pages 
pages may dangling variety reasons obvious crawler crawled 
time original pagerank algorithm conceived web served static set human edited documents residing filesystems 
assumption sense reason percentage web covered crawl attempt index web 
years web evolved large number sites produce dynamic content driven databases 
estimated dynamic pages times numerous static pages fact situation worse 
essentially infinite number urls limited size namespace 
example www amazon com currently uses dynamically generated urls session id embedded 
prior knowledge fact crawler find essentially unbounded number urls crawl site 
problem indexing ranking indexable web starts problem identifying constitutes usable web 
possible approach avoiding database driven dynamic pages avoid crawling urls contain character 
unfortunately heuristic unreliable particular commonplace query fragments urls produce static content 
database driven pages urls contain character arguments database query encoded differently url 
appear crawler exactly static file web page difficult prune number pages crawled 
result search engines faced vast excess potentially indexable content 
fact essentially unbounded number urls suggests steady state crawler search engine frontier pages frontier relatively large 
reasons page considered dangling page 
protected robots txt limits standard practice crawling 
pages may contain high quality information great interest readers worthy indexing 
important note page crawled may indexable anchor text 
anchor text substitute full text indexing proved remarkably effective satisfying web search queries 
important able evaluate relative ranking dangling nodes fact calculated pagerank pages top protected robots txt 
paradoxically may reasons calculate rank page longer exists significant document removed political legal reasons 
reason dangling nodes pages genuinely outlink 
example postscript pdf files web contain embedded outlinks content tends relatively high quality 
url dangling page meta tag indicating links followed page requires authentication wall street journal site 
reasons dangling nodes include return class response crawl time due configuration problem servers resolvable dns routing problems experience crawling shown crawling pages number pages far exceeds number crawled pages 
time took snapshot crawled approximately pages crawler knew pages 
partly function crawl ordering experience shows fraction dangling pages remain large reasonable expenditure resources pages dangling links 
show snapshot distribution number dangling outlinks page crawling approximately pages 
nearly pages turn outlinks andrei broder size web depends strongly laptop web configured produce links essentially infinite number urls 
crawled outlinks fully explored rest middle 
crawl halted point pages dangling outlinks 
adjusting crawl strategy change shape graph size queue large fraction total urls known 
fraction outlinks page percentage pages truncating page crawl pages crawled fraction outlinks pages discovered far 
show cumulative distribution number pages vs fraction outlinks crawled 
crawled outlinks pages means pages links frontier 
suggests problem dealing large numbers dangling nodes pervasive important 
omit ranking dangling nodes ignoring majority potential pages neglecting effect rankings pages crawled 
crawler faced limitless supply urls crawl important assign ranks dangling pages order efficiently manage crawling resources 

experimental methodology current observations large crawl performed ibm almaden 
began extracting links pages links extending urls 
process extracting links constructing graph took considerable amount computation cluster machines 
bit machines available spent considerable amount effort reduce data set manageable 
began replacing urls byte hash values produced data set approximately gigabytes links saving urls consumes gigabytes compression 
separated dangling links non dangling links leaving approximately non dangling links 
step assigned byte ids urls rewrote graph compact format 
aside treatment dangling pages similar procedure previous authors larger scale :10.1.1.18.5084
large amount effort went data gathering step amount time dedicated actual pagerank calculations shorter 
imperative evaluation algorithms ranking pages take data extraction preprocessing account 
hand link gathering preprocessing links theoretically done parallel crawl actual pagerank calculation generally done offline see 
reason methods accelerate convergence iterative pagerank algorithm effective 
algorithms local information online fashion appealing pagerank requires data 
smaller data sets intranets problem 

handling dangling pages reviewing suggestions previously handling dangling pages 
original pagerank authors suggested simply removing links dangling pages graph calculating page rank remaining pages :10.1.1.31.1768:10.1.1.31.1768
doing suggested added back significantly affecting results details lacking analysis effect dangling nodes 
authors suggested removing dangling nodes re inserting iterations 
note removing dangling links entirely skew results non dangling nodes somewhat outdegrees pages adjusted reflect lack links dangling nodes 
approach suggested note approach preferable leaving calculation 
approach 
note process removing dangling nodes may produce new dangling nodes process repeated iteratively dangling nodes remain 
theory may remove practice process terminates quickly web 
chose omit iterative step process preferred save information possible graph compute ranks dangling pages anyway 
alternative method handling dangling pages jump randomly selected page probability dangling node 
approach mentioned treated formally follows 
suppose nodes graph partitioned subsets 
corresponds completely strongly connected subgraph 

remaining nodes subset links outlinks 
addition approach assume virtual th node random jumps may 
new node set denoted 
addition add new edges define expanded edge set suitably partitioning matrix vector pagerank nodes may computed principal eigenvector computation dj degree node cij dij row dimension vector conforming dimension 
note individual equations cx dx may exploit structure compute reduced eigen system reduced matrix column stochastic solve equation standard iterative method power iteration allows compute 
comparing systems see solution may identified may solve reduced eigensystem problem obtain compute ranks nodes single step 
lead significant savings small 
simple examples extreme cases existence dangling pages significant effects ranking non dangling pages 
consider simplest example possible 
example crucial difference allow teleportation dangling nodes 
allow uniform jumps dangling node nodes including dangling node transition matrix need teleportation graph strongly connected 
event get higher rank page pages 
consider case teleportation dangling nodes avoided notation previous section 

case reduced transition matrix matrix corresponding normalized pagerank scores 
page gets higher score pages intuitively clear inlinks 
back rank dangling page value lower rank virtual node receives random teleportation jumps 
slightly complicated example illustrates dangling pages higher rank non dangling pages page example page example simple examples dangling links 
page example shows dangling pages higher rank non dangling pages teleportation dangling nodes forbidden 
solving reduced system backing values obtain normalized ranks including virtual node note virtual page highest rank expect page higher rank connected pages 
link rot ranking dangling pages noted extremely high quality page points may considered hub characteristics result link relationship 
contrast pages dangling produced response code considered reflect poorly pages link 
primary reasons links exist page existed time link created subsequently removed web causing broken link

anecdotal evidence novelty wears web matures growing trend link rot links worked time broken removal content web change url 
studies forecast half life url years half pages tracked com domain disappeared months 
crawl pages discovered approximately web pages linked turned return code 
presumably reflect fraction pages longer maintained poorly authored place 
time passes expect problem worsen increasing fraction pages web fall 
experiments observed crawl progresses percentage penalty pages tends increase 
related observation najork wiener breadth order crawling tends find highly ranked pages early crawl 
show rate penalty pages discovered crawl pages 
rate starts high drops quickly rise crawl progresses 
reason crawl seeded large set urls previous crawl 
attempted rate dropped started rise 
quality pages encountered crawl tends decrease probability having links penalty pages increases appears correlation events 
fraction penalty pages number pages crawled rate penalty pages encountered page crawl 
initially high rate caused large seed set previous crawl 
initial dip rate climbs rest crawl 
section describe algorithms explicitly discriminate pages basis point penalty pages
