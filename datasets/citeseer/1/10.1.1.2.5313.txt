nowadays large modern enterprise different portions organization different database management systems store search critical data 
competition evolving technology geographic distribution inevitable growing decentralization contribute diversity 
databases important enterprise different interfaces administration 
useful enterprise retrieve information common interface realize instance full value data contain 
term federated database emerged characterize techniques proving integrated data access having set distributed heterogeneous autonomous databases 
briefly explain concepts autonomy users applications access data federated system local system 
autonomy classified types design autonomy communication autonomy execution autonomy 
distribution nowadays computers connected type network especially internet natural think combining application data sources physically located different hosts communicate network 
heterogeneity classified categories structure syntax system semantic 
structure heterogeneity involves different data models syntax heterogeneity involves different languages data representations system heterogeneity involves hardware operating systems 
semantic heterogeneity classified semantically equivalent concepts models different terms refer concept synonyms properties modeled differently distinct systems semantically unrelated concepts term may distinct systems denote completely different concepts semantically related concepts generalization specification different classifications

describe method building structure ontology 
shows algorithm designed 
see method main stages building shared vocabulary building local ontologies defining mappings 
stage embodies set tasks achieved 
briefly explain stage example 
ontolingua represent ontology example 
stage building shared vocabulary shows stage contains main steps analysis information sources search terms primitives defining global ontology 
step implies complete analysis information sources information stored stored meaning information semantic localize problems semantic heterogeneity previously explained 
example shows example similar systems containing information transporting milk 
example clearly see semantic problems property type mismatch different classification 
problem reflected amount attribute systems classes meaning different representations liter gallon 
system milk truck classes amount attribute represent amount transported milk 
instances amount attribute 
hand system classes amount attribute represented 
second problem different classification reflected truck class system system hierarchy trucks truck truck 
systems different classifications denote things 
truck class system includes system 
second step search terms primitives implies choice list terms concepts agreement shared vocabulary 
example list terms milk gallon amount truck truck truck 
include terms hierarchy classification descriptive 
previously mentioned truck class system includes trucks 
inclusion hierarchy global ontology provides semantic information 
see happens system 
ontology construction method third step defining global ontology uses terms chosen step create global ontology 
shows global ontology generated systems defined 
systems different representations classes milk define class milk set types def thing gallon define class gallon set def thing truck define class truck set trucks def thing truck define class truck set trucks def truck truck define class truck set trucks def truck relations amount define relation amount frame value amount expressed def gallon frame number value transporting define relation transporting truck milk gallon amount milk transported truck def truck truck milk milk gallon gallon global ontology represented ontology gallon class 
transporting relation transporting define relation transporting truck milk number amount milk transported truck def truck truck milk milk number number primitive type number replacing gallon class 
representation acceptable ontolingua clear provide semantic information available system 
fact inclusion classes describing attribute types ontology best choice providing semantic information required 
second stage building local ontologies shows stage contains main steps analysis information source defining local ontologies 
step similar stage previously explained 
complete analysis information sources 
analysis performed independently account information sources 
analysis second step performed 
shows ontologies systems described 
ontology defines classes relationships 
ontology milk liter truck subclasses classes amount relation represent domain 
ontology classes relations liter class replaced gallon class indicating different milk measures 
third stage defining mappings stage define mappings relations concepts defined global ontology local ontologies 
stage solve semantic heterogeneity problems making connections stages 
example global ontology gallon class represent metric measure milk 
liter class ontology represented global ontology include axiom relate classes 
liter equals gallon 
liter gallon mapping performed users query integrated system asking information amount milk liter measure 
global ontology gallon class 
users queries global ontology mapping retrieve information needed 
mapping needed truck classes systems name denote things 

discussion method serves practical guide analyze integrated data advantage ontologies 
ontologies allow capturing semantic information provided system 
semantic problems localized solved method followed 
propertytype mismatch different classification described section 
proposal hybrid ontology approach main advantages new information sources added need modification 
terms relations new source global ontology added 
classes milk define class milk set types def thing liter define class liter def thing truck define class truck set trucks def thing truck define class truck set trucks def truck truck define class truck set trucks def truck relations amount define relation amount frame value amount expressed def liter frame number value transporting define relation transporting truck milk liter amount milk transported truck def truck truck milk milk liter liter classes milk define class milk set types def thing gallon define class gallon set def thing truck define class truck set trucks def thing relations amount define relation amount frame value amount expressed def gallon frame number value transporting define relation transporting truck milk gallon amount milk transported truck def truck truck milk milk gallon gallon ontology ontology local ontology mappings new added terms defined 
shared vocabulary mappings local ontologies 
method solve problems referred data integration example terms synonyms homonyms 
synonyms correspond case different words meaning homonyms correspond systems word denote different meanings 
working finding specific methods determine solve problems 
implementing feature models proposed cognitive psychologists judge similarity terms distinguishing features concepts objects properties roles rules 
models tversky model ontologies defines similarity measure feature matching process 
produces similarity value result common features result differences objects 
functions determine terms relations synonyms 
functions relate terms ontology 
functions compare different aspects terms parts functions attributes 
parts structural elements concept term roof floor building functions represent purpose concept attributes correspond additional characteristics concept 
extending method include idea contexts assuming term true false context context determines truth falsity statement meaning 
main advantage contexts avoidance problem 
systems word term denoting different meanings different contexts need compared 
ontology related contexts indicating different roles database 
example cases uml specification source obtain contexts 
context contains series terms included ontology 
define relationships contexts different ontologies 
terms included related contexts compared 
accordingly new extensions approach help finding solving heterogeneity problems 
inclusion similarity functions gives precise comparison terms different ontologies 
combination ontologies contexts provides higher degree semantic information needed consistent data integration 

current research data integration uses ontology concept help solving semantic heterogeneity problems 
create useful practical method construction hybrid ontology approach 
method main stages building shared vocabulary building local ontologies defining mappings 
stage embodies number steps followed 
step serves guide identify cases semantic heterogeneity ways solve 
research ongoing number aspects analyzed 
aim including context concept solve example problem different representations working including similarity functions find similarity terms different local ontologies 
method extensions need validated complex examples real cases study
