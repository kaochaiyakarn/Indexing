exor chooses prioritized candidate list follows 
identifies shortest path destination breaking ties equally short paths information delivery ratio matrix 
node path highest priority candidate 
exor deletes node loss rate matrix finds shortest route uses hop route candidate second priority 
repeats process find remaining candidates 
resulting candidate set destination cached update delivery ratio matrix

heuristic depend characteristics network chose study simpler approach 
acknowledgments major challenges opportunistic routing ensuring candidate nodes agree forward packet 
propose modified version mac reserves multiple slots time receiving nodes return acknowledgments 
indicating packet successfully received acknowledgment contains id highest priority successful recipient known ack sender 
candidates listen ack slots deciding forward case low priority candidate ack reports high priority candidate id including id sender highest priority ack time heard far helps suppress duplicate forwarding 
suppose node hears transmission highest priority candidate sends ack 
node priority candidate hear ack node hear ack 
suppose node hears node ack 
acks contain ids node forward packet knowledge highest priority recipient 
fact node ack contains node id indirectly notifies node receive packet 
deciding forward packet slotted acknowledgment window passed candidate local decision forward discard packet 
nodes received acknowledgments containing id higher priority candidate forward packet 
occasionally multiple nodes forward packet due acknowledgment reception failure 
reason packet contains random nonce forwarding nodes store cache eliminate possibility forwarding packet multiple times 
packet transmitted nonce cache
