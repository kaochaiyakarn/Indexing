group information cardinality relevance example subgroup model 
modeling heterogeneous tourist groups aim achieving compact representation heterogeneous tourist group individual participants described possibly conflicting preferences separately represented 
model group set partitioned number homogeneous subgroups members similar characteristics preferences 
iii type representation preserves peculiarities subgroups supports efficient evaluation group preferences usually need performed granularity level individual members 
support flexible generation recommendations model subgroups may different degrees influence estimation group preferences 
instance subgroup particularly represents large portion tourist group members belong relevant tourist class special needs children disabled people 
briefly describe structure subgroup models type information manage 
intrigue exploits structured group model subgroups represented distinct entities 
subgroup model associated homogeneous subgroup people participating tour 
subgroup model structured portions characteristics store socio demographic information participants represents subgroup people aged human science background interested arts history 
preferences specify system estimates subgroup requirements properties tourist attractions 
worth noting mapping preferences properties describing tourist attractions preference associate corresponding property 
sake simplicity name identify preference corresponding property 
preference represented slot facets importance specifies strength subgroup preference denotes strongly preference influences subgroup evaluations items 
instance travelers represented model shown interest special transportation services importance highly interested historical value attractions importance 
probability distribution values preference specifies likelihood subgroup prefers attractions having specified property values 
suppose set attractions described terms property 
attraction ai assume value vi property 
group model probability distribution specifies likelihood subgroup prefers attraction ai property assumes value ai 
instance tourists described group prefer attractions having high historical value historical value high 
group information stores cardinality specifying number group members relevance representing estimate weight preferences member recommendation tourist attractions 
relevance ranges null relevance maximum 
example subgroup includes people medium relevance 
subgroup model automatically generated system combining information elicited user stereotypical knowledge typical tourist classes considered domain rich 
interaction user asked people going travel 
system asks distribute people subgroups basis characteristics age background interests 
subgroup registration form displayed provide system information subgroup members fields forms mandatory 
iv basis pieces information provided subgroup subgroup model initialized matching characteristics stereotypical information best matching stereotypes predict subgroup preferences relevance obtaining model similar shown details see ardissono goy 
worth noting stereotypes defined analyzing tourist population different perspectives different stereotypes describe tourists different interests different classes capabilities visually physically impaired 
personalized recommendation attractions recommendation items user complex additional problem recommending items heterogeneous groups 
reason evaluation items achieved steps 
items separately ranked preferences subgroup account subgroup related rankings combined obtain ranking suitable group 
phase approach supports adoption alternative recommendation policies applied set subgroup related rankings 
evaluation tourist attractions suitability tourist attraction preferences subgroup henceforth satisfaction score estimated matching properties item subgroup preferences 
evaluation model takes importance properties account support flexible ranking behavior attraction matching important preferences recommended subgroup fails match important ones 
contrast important properties represent necessary requirements attraction failing match important preference recommended 
approach reflects requirements tourist domain hard constraints modeled 
instance tourist place transportation service suitable disabled people recommended group tourists mobility problems satisfies interests 
evaluation suitability item evaluation satisfaction score item item property matched related preference establish property score 
score decimal value represents perfect compatibility preference represents total incompatibility 
satisfaction score item results merge property scores 
property scores combined means formula 
see ardissono goy thorough description satisfaction score formula takes values 
additive supports incremental evaluation satisfaction score 
particularly selective implements fuzzy property scores product operator returns satisfaction score item having null property score 
selective power enables system downgrade evaluation items incompatible basic requirements subgroups contrast neutral value product properties score modify satisfaction score 
described related section selected formula place alternative ones deriving multi attribute decision theory stronger selective power 
evaluation property score item property score property historical value evaluated matching value item description high corresponding preference subgroup model 
match depends probability subgroup prefers items specific value 
weak requirements weak influence subgroup evaluations attractions match depends importance preference subgroup 
property scores range represents perfect match subgroup preferences denotes total mismatch 
means properties value preferred subgroup high probability receive score near irrelevant properties receive similar score value preferred subgroup low probability 
specifically consider item property suppose value fitting item qi 
suppose subgroup preference importance probability qi 
property score computed follows ii function raises score important properties score property related preference importance possible value 
contrast score important properties depends probability distribution subgroup model 
behavior coherent strategy adopted evaluate satisfaction score item 
evaluation fuzzy property scores concerning item properties property low importance influence satisfaction score 
property score close neutral value fuzzy 
evolution properties scores basis importance 
shows impact importance evaluation property score sample properties represented solid line dashed line 
example value probability subgroup model probability 
property item item item item prop val prop score prop val prop score eye high high special transportation systems missing special facilities vision missing historical value high high artistic value medium high scientific value null high documentation scholastic missing evaluation property scores tourist attractions 
example consider preferences stored subgroup model shown sample items item item property values reported 
column table shows properties second third columns show respectively property values fitting item resulting property scores columns report property values property scores concerning item 
example compute property scores items step compute satisfaction score items step 

item property scores evaluated matching property values fitting item related subgroup preferences 
match depends importance properties 
instance items differ scientific value item scientific value item high scientific value get property score subgroup care corresponding preference importance scientific value 
consider property score special facilities vision property item importance preference equal probability missing value 
property score evaluated 
property score properties importance eye historical value coincides probability property values subgroup model 

satisfaction scores items evaluated applying formula property scores satisfaction score item 
application formula builds idea evaluation assume item perfectly matches subgroup model satisfaction score item equal 
soon encounter property score lower satisfaction score 
formula fuzzy null property score sets satisfaction score item results completely unsuitable subgroup
