example consider case data came joe tom hanks fan information collection joe information available source piece data 
able keep provenance assertion level 
instance suppose entry tom hanks actor

tap infrastructure knowledge source construction tap system data fragments disparate xml soap web services disparate html web sites single schematically unified global knowledge base

tap system types knowledge source tracking 
method implicit tap server knows interacting example cnn knows data receives session cnn 
second method explicit data retrieved manipulated tap object identifiers entity discussed examined discover page originated

knowledge base created view aggregation content available multiple sources store source information statement granularity store information knowledge base multiple sources distinguish assertions came source 
knowledge provenance usage infrastructure provides support provenance information possible identify document document element associate provenance information 
provides systematic way generating documents relevant semantic part web 
approaches considered application provenance information incorporates source meta information documents incorporates knowledge process information documents interacts data server performing multi site aggregation data provenance information 
incorporating source meta information applications infrastructure need store manipulate data corresponding provenance information particular format provenance information kept separately reassembled request 
fact approach avoid transporting provenance data services access simply accept cost storing maintaining provenance information necessary order support trustworthiness data 
provenance information needed added file basis 
application service retrieve provenance information apply preferred way incorporating information including reification appending new xml elements quads 
example rdf daml owl files application approach tap documents tap ask uri provenance information piece information rdf triple apply reification 
identification specific piece information document may problem document formats xml 
expect new standards xml xpath provide solution problem xml files 
incorporating knowledge process information application computes answer inference web infrastructure allows dump portable proof format computation process 
allows interaction mode ask application regeneration answer portable proof support demand interaction style sense 
case agent user inference web portable proof find ground facts supporting derived answer 
application dumps limited granularity proof told information particular source told information source applied complicated reasoning user access sources application manipulated information 
encourage granularity portable proof dumps support demand explanations giving access deduction path require 
allows interact question answering systems want provide details information manipulation path provide access source original information 
important note portable proof forest proof trees single tree 
structure required inference web support infrastructures multiple question answering systems contribute pieces answer support hybrid reasoning environments query managers may break questions components different agents answer 
support situations answer obtained multiple paths 
forest feature potential reason inference web knowledge provenance may suited potentially better suited data provenance approach supporting explanation semantic web 
querying provenance information node repository daml owl files mirrored relational database
