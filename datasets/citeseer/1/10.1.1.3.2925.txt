knowledge mining knowledge mining approach question answering data driven strategy capitalizes enormous amounts text freely available world wide web 
biggest challenges question answering relating formulation question different formulations answers 
consider question alaska state document plainly stated alaska state january answer relatively easy extract 
unfortunately expressiveness natural language allows meaning expressed variety different ways answer question stated alaska admitted union january answer shares keywords common question system require sophisticated reasoning ability recognize paraphrases order relate answer question 
knowledge mining approach question answering attempts overcome difficulty leveraging massive size web 
important implication web size data redundancy item information potentially stated ways different documents 
question answering system capitalize redundancy ways surrogate sophisticated natural language techniques method overcoming poor document quality 
consider question chamberlain score points possible answers chamberlain scored points march new 
december chamberlain scored points triple overtime game 
new nba record coach frank mcguire didn expect long saying ll get points someday mcguire prediction came true just months game new york march 
obviously answer easily extracted sentence passage 
general task answering question difficult document collection contains answer stated simple reformulation question 
cases simple keyword techniques coupled named entity detection technology suffice identify answer 
luxury massive amounts data question answering system may forced extract answers passages obviously stated passage 
cases sophisticated natural language processing may required recognizing syntactic alternations resolving anaphora making commonsense inferences performing relative date calculations web big simple pattern matching techniques obviate need understand structure meaning language 
data chance answer appear simple reformulation question 
cases answer extracted searching directly anticipated answer form example searching string chamberlain scored points extracting words occurring right 
naturally simple technique depends crucially corpus having answer formulated specific way larger text collection greater probability simple pattern matching techniques yield correct answer 
data redundancy enables simple trick overcome troublesome issues natural language processing 
effect data redundancy quantified researchers 
breck noticed correlation number times answer appeared trec corpus average performance trec systems particular question 
similarly clarke noticed upward trend performance question answering system larger corpus extract answers 
results verify intuition times answer appears different formulations easier find 
web environment data redundancy serves guard erroneous information 
quality documents web lower typical closed corpora collections newspaper articles single instance answer inherently untrustworthy 
fact usually stated multiple times multiple documents question answering system utilize distribution answers multiple sources gauge reliability 
tremendous amounts information world wide web useless effective method data access 
providing basic infrastructure indexing retrieving text scales tremendous engineering task

knowledge mining modules data flow knowledge mining component aranea shown 
sections describe module detail 
formulate requests step answering questions translate queries requests 
requests specify formulate requests execute requests generate grams vote filter candidates combine candidates score candidates get support data flow knowledge mining component aranea 
context answers analogous queries posed traditional information retrieval systems 
aranea relies web search engines fulfill requests fine grained control query result set difficult aranea relies quantity lack quality 
types queries generated module exact queries inexact queries 
queries types concurrently generated usually different scores 
inexact query indicates answer vicinity set keywords 
composed treating natural language question bag words 
contrast exact query details specific location potential answer answer period appear words bytes right exact phrase period ended 
exact queries aranea generated approximately dozen pattern matching rules query terms part speech tags morpho lexical pattern matches trigger creation reformulated exact queries 
example previous query generated rule wh word verb verb ed 
internal lexicon ensures generated verb remains properly conjugated 
complete example requests generated response question period shown 
aranea generates inexact exact request query assigned basic score helps establish relative importance queries 
execute requests request execution module responsible retrieving textual snippets honor constraints set forth request 
currently google mine text web 
case inexact requests entire summary query period type inexact score number snippets mine query period ended type inexact score number snippets mine query period ended type exact score number snippets mine maximum length maximum word count typical requests generated aranea 
provided google extracted processing 
exact queries request execution module performs additional pattern matching ensure correct positional constraints satisfied 
generate grams module exhaustively generates possible unigrams bigrams trigrams text fragments generated request execution module 
grams initial scores equal weight request derive serve candidate answers 
vote voting module grams generated previous module 
new score answer candidate equal sum scores occurrences particular gram 
module effect promoting text fragments occur frequently context query terms answer user question 
process voting meant counteract low average quality individual documents 
web documents poorly written barely edited simply contain incorrect information 
text extracted single document trusted correct answer multiple occurrences answer different documents lends credibility proposed answer 
filter candidates stage processing coarse grained filter applied answer candidates candidates stopwords discarded 
candidates contain words original user question discarded 
exception rule question focus words question meters 
answered expression containing word meters 
stage encodes heuristics potentially decrease number answer candidates 
example answer far fast tall unfortunately technique equates popular answer correct answer occasionally results responses 
questions invariably contain numeric component numeric digits numerals safely discard answer candidates fit criteria 
heuristics employed module tend filter high confidence side lenient 
false positive results sorted modules system able recover false negatives 
addition set fixed list filters applied questions answer types closed class items 
example question language people speak brazil answered language safely throw answer candidate isn language 
variety question types sport 
nationality 
relatively straightforward enumerate acceptable answer candidates 
cases fixed lists high precision filters throw irrelevant candidates 
implemented roughly dozen filters aranea 
combine candidates module shorter answers evidence boost score longer answers 
portion candidate answer appears candidate answer score shorter answer added score longer answer 
example de soto appears list candidate answers de soto score shorter candidate added score longer 
module counteracts tendency gram generation voting modules favor shorter answers 
score candidates score answer candidate multiplied factor log wc set keywords candidate answer total number words corpus wc number occurrences word corpus 
scoring balances effect individual keywords having different unconditioned priors 
exact distribution unigrams web easily obtained reliable manner aranea uses statistics corpus surrogate 
official corpus trec question answering track aquaint corpus comprised roughly articles new york times associated press news service
