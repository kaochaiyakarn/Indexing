primary differences formation network 
traditional wired networks network formation considered systematic participating node assigned identity administrator device network

ad hoc networks device participation dynamic 
possible assume controlling entity administrator device network assign addresses nodes 
handle issue konark assumes ip level connectivity ad hoc networks 
valid assumption considering modern devices run operating systems provide automatic configuration techniques 
assumption konark independent lower network layers irda bluetooth protocol ip implemented 
important design factor service discovery protocol storage services metadata information available services 
possible approach centralized repository keeps track available services network 
network member offering service register service repository devices seeking service query available services 
approach best suited traditional wired networks possible assume device remain network

ibm developed addresses service discovery problem wireless single hop ad hoc networks 
device maintains view services network periodically exchanges view world full list service map neighbors 
periodic broadcast scheduled proactive way device finds local services absent messages broadcast neighbors expire schedules broadcast sooner usual 
showed timely convergence approach compared regular periodic broadcast scheme 
having successfully developed demonstrated service discovery delivery framework mobile devices ad hoc network konark project second phase main focus efficient service discovery protocol exploit nature highly dynamic ad hoc networks 
target environment goal similar konark envisions dynamic ad hoc networks pursues decentralized solution problem 
confines small network assuming single hop ad hoc network broadcasts fit single message 
primary goal faster convergence service information available network 
argue effort maintain convergence highly dynamic ad hoc network may paid may impossible attain 
believe striking balance convergence time network bandwidth desirable dynamic environment 
new algorithm fast distributed service discovery kind gossip protocols 
algorithm node multicasts subset knowledge relevant part services question 
words node sees service message konark multicast address multicasts difference view relevant services services received message 
multicast scheduled wait random time network avoid multicast storm immediate simultaneous multicasts time learn available services 
nodes new information multicasts scheduled point able cancel multicast 
way reduce network bandwidth usage due unnecessarily repeated multicasts plain periodic advertisement schemes 
note significant amount exchanged information waste nodes network service information 
multicast round delta message triggered service query message service re advertisement message absence query messages certain time window 
result delta gossip protocol achieves fast convergence service information efficiently distributed way incurring excessive advertisement traffic 
konark aims wireless multi hop ad hoc network usually larger support 
implies service information exchange messages may exceed broadcast message length limit 
case protocol randomly chooses services number service instances single multicast message affords hoping nodes covers rest
