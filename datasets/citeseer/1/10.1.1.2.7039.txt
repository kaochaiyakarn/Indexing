context semantic web ontologies expected play important role helping automated processes called intelligent agents access information 
particular ontologies expected provide structured vocabularies explicate relationships different terms allowing intelligent agents humans interpret meaning flexibly unambiguously 
example suitable pizza ontology include information kinds cheese cheese kind meat fish vegetarian pizza include meat fish 
information allows term pizza unambiguously interpreted pizza ordering agent specialisation term vegetarian pizza

problem rdf breaks rdf triples 
means owl constructs property restrictions encoded triples 
owl generally uses encoding similar daml oil

example problem rdf collections triples owl onproperty ex child owl allvaluesfrom issues addressed oil provides guidance happen collections triples don match syntax productions language 
daml oil takes different approach allowing unusual constructions declining give daml oil meaning 
owl roughly followed daml oil solution modifications 
semantic problems issues syntax addressed issues related meaning remain 
rdf provides meaning triple owl considered extension rdf meaning owl provides triples needs extension rdf meaning

oil particular bother relate rdf meaning rdf xml syntax oil meaning syntax rdf xml syntax oil constructs syntax rdf triples rdf semantics document 
rdf triple written subject predicate object order 
rdf uri triples generally abbreviated xml qualified names 
rdf blank nodes anonymous objects written leading

daml oil better job rdf meaning syntax 
daml oil model theory includes semantic condition triples close rdf meaning defined time triples 
daml oil uses built rdf rdfs vocabulary greater extent oil uses way generally compatible rdf rdfs meaning defined time vocabulary 
example daml oil uses rdfs subclassof relate classes superclasses including daml oil restrictions oil uses oil situations 
daml oil developed aspects meaning rdfs reconciled appropriate meaning daml oil 
particular rdfs unusual meaning domains ranges properties

example asking individual belonged class add syntax specify class premises query 
standard theory inferencing 
effects change seen simple example 
information ex john rdf type ex student ex john rdf type ex employee fairly easy arrange asking john belonged intersection student employee ensured intersection existed asked john belonged 
turning entailment requires information entail owl intersectionof rdf ex student rdf rest rdf ex employee rdf rest rdf nil ex john rdf type rdf meaning ascribed triples requires existence triples encode syntax 
owl develop method augments new rdf semantics just support inferences strong semantic paradoxes discussed detail section 
expressive power things expected owl see long list design goals requirements objectives demands expressive power going generally provided description logics 
example users wanted able associate information classes properties classes belong classes possible rdf 
similarly demands expressive power going rdf rdfs 
example users wanted able provide local typing property values possible description logics 
owl designed allow sorts expressivity retaining connections roots 
daml oil developed datatype supported rdf literals roughly undifferentiated values strings 
daml oil provide solution datatypes allowing xml schema datatypes 
reasonable solution uses rdf syntax needs help rdf extension rdf syntax daml oil solution remained incomplete 
note owl constructs intersectionof unionof encoded rdf lists constructed rdf rdf rest triples see owl document full details 
rdf added version similar different daml oil solution 
owl needed move daml oil rdf 
computational problems aspect owl distinguishes rdf rdfs supports rich set inferences 
inferences quite obvious example students employees appear easy compute 
inferences supported owl quite complex requiring reasoning cases chains properties 
representational desires owl created formalism key inference problems undecidable

owl uses extension daml oil solution triples form formed owl constructs extra meaning owl onproperty ex child special owl meaning

providing viable semantic theory owl rdf model theory full fledged notion entailment owl provide upward compatible model theory appropriately handles entailments owl constructs 
easy owl able extend rdf syntax new bits syntax owl meaning 
requirement owl rdf syntax syntax carried rdf meaning 
way compatibility requirement stronger usually imposed weaker formalisms propositional logic stronger formalisms firstorder logic stronger formalism allowed extend syntax weaker formalism 
severe aspect problem owl syntactic constructs encoded multiple triples retain rdf meaning triples 
rdf triples carry semantic conditions just inferred 
owl semantics add special constraints essentially state owl interpretation include certain constructs 
constraints usually called comprehension principles 
example comprehension principle owl states model include finite lists classes states list corresponding intersection class requiring class connected list owl intersectionof property 
comprehension principles support entailment ex john rdf type ex student ex john rdf type ex employee owl intersectionof rdf ex student rdf rest rdf ex employee rdf rest rdf nil ex john rdf type required list student employee required tail list required intersection list 
additional usual semantic conditions require ex john belong finishing required entailment hold 
avoiding paradoxes comprehension principles powerful create little 
power easily lead serious problems 
example russell paradox paradox precisely comprehension principles built early version set theory 
early version set theory comprehension principle stated set constructed things satisfied formula free variable formula human human construct set humans human 
unfortunately formula belonging oneself set arises 
set causes problems exists impossible determine belongs 
comprehension principle mandates exists causing early version set theory collapse 
similar situation arise owl 
natural want circular owl constructs example classes instances related instances class owl onproperty ex child owl allvaluesfrom naive representation aspects biology 
having comprehension principles circular classes easily lead requirement existence classes owl onproperty rdf type owl allvaluesfrom owl rdf rdf rest rdf nil class things type relationship class 
objects belong class belong vice versa comprehension principles required existence class owl ontology paradoxical 
avoid paradoxes owl comprehension principles require existence circular chains 
mean entailments expect ones involving construct ex child example having person children belong construct valid owl 
devising comprehension principles took surprising amount effort involved determining ground rules principles
