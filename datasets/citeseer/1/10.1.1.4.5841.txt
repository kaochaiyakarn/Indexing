section concludes short summary outlook 

swws requirements section introduces vision semantic web enabled web services providing case newly hired employee requires laptop workplace 
order buy defines characteristics laptop processor speed disk size 
purchasing process sure new employee manager authorizes purchase 
configuration laptop alternative hardware vendor offerings collected price comparison done 
cheapest laptop determined service contract years purchased laptop 
service contract laptop vendor independent insurance 
better equipped laptop service contract cheaper bought separately 
cheapest combination laptop purchase order issued 
finding alternative laptops service contracts final purchase supported fully automated human user involvement 
mediation related problems solved case process modeled executed business process 
includes human non human tasks 
transmissions networks secured trading partner requirements protocols involved 
possible laptop vendors service contract vendors discovered messages exchanged 
different document type formats understood transformed prices products comparable 
essential requirements explicit representation semantics ontologies 
alternative purchase approaches necessary case separate buys service contract case purchases laptop service contract succeed 
various aspects identified necessary achieve intelligent automatic web service discovery selection mediation composition complex services 
document types 
document types describe content business documents purchase orders invoices 
content defined terms elements order number line item price 
document types instantiated actual business data service requester service provider exchange data 
payloads messages sent back forth structured document types defined 
ontologies ideal concept describe structure semantics document types 
syntax 
documents represented different syntaxes available 
xml popular syntax non xml syntax cases edi www org 
semantics 
elements document types populated correct values semantically correct interpreted correctly service requesters providers 
requires vocabulary defined enumerates describes valid element values example list product names products ordered manufacturer 
examples unit measures country codes 
second rules may allow generating consistent values automatically 
ontologies provide means defining concepts semantics data exchanged 
ontologies available document types refer ontology concepts 
ensures consistency textual representation concepts exchanged allows interpretation concepts trading partners involved 
intent exchanged document defined 
example purchase order sent necessarily clear means purchase order needs created deleted updated 
intent needs semantically clear interpret sent document 
transport binding 
transport mechanisms available mime ftp 
service requester service provider agree transport service requests executed 
available transport layout message agreed document sent represented message sent 
exchange sequence definition 
communication networks currently inherently unreliable 
required service requester service provider sure protocols messages transmitted exactly 
process definition 
assumption messages exchanged exactly service requester service provider business logic defined terms business message exchange sequence 
example purchase order confirmed purchase order acknowledgment 
processes define required business message logic order derive consistent business state 
security 
fundamentally message exchange private unmodified service requester service provider non reputable 
encryption signing ensures unmodified privacy non repudiation services ensure service requester service provider claim sent message different 

modeling framework wsmf section introduces web service modeling framework wsmf provides model developing describing web services composition 
philosophy wsmf principles maximal de coupling ii complemented scalable mediation service 
model wsmf consists main different elements ontologies provide terminology elements goal repositories define problems solved web services web services descriptions define various aspects web service mediators bypass interoperability problems 
mentioned earlier ontologies key enabling technology semantic web 
human understanding symbols machine 
framework ontologies define vocabulary elements wsmf specifications document types 
enable reuse terminology interoperability components referring linked concepts 
description goal specifies objectives client may consults web service 
goal specifications kept separate actual web service descriptions mapping web service serve different goals obviously different competing web services serve goal 
example amazon com buy book broker bibliographic information books 
conversely different may subscribe goal 
web service description languages distinguish elementary complex web services 
elementary web services simple input output boxes complex web services break process sub tasks may call web services 
wsmf identifies aspects describing web services 
mediating components general importance component software development 
introduced adapter pattern textbook design patterns object oriented system development 
adapters enable reusable descriptions objects possible combine objects differ syntactical input output descriptions 
introduced concept adapter architectural descriptions knowledge systems de couple different elements model encapsulate different elements explicitly model interactions 
software architectures describes systems terms components connectors establish proper relationships cf 

focus mediate different interaction styles components call business logic web service 
heterogeneous distributed information systems developed concepts wrappers mediator 
assuming global data schema heterogeneous information knowledge systems mediator translates user queries sub queries different information sources integrates sub answers 
open flexible environment web computing adapters essential means cope inherent heterogeneity

mediation support swws 
wsmf assumes peer peer communication structure trading partners 
means trading partners able communicate directly intermediary 
consequently swws able connect trading partner 
course intermediaries possible marketplaces hubs 
case communication structure trading partner intermediary 
consequence point point structure involved trading partner needs able mediate differences document types semantics business process behavior 
internal definition document purchase order dictated application system correspond exactly exchanged trading partners 
enumerates possible mismatches exist 
applies semantics values differ 
simple example internal convention long state names california short version ca document exchanged 
addition business processes mismatch trading partners 
acknowledgments internally trading partners exchanging messages 
outlines possibilities 
order mediate differences semantic transformation component included swws architecture addresses mismatches allows mediation 
semantic transformation engine provides possible mismatch rule set overcomes mismatch 
example ca transformed california case document content 
case mismatch processes generates missing acknowledgments consumes superfluous ones 
underlying idea ontology mediation lift schema data conceptual level form ontology associated instances 
subsequently provide means declarative ontology mapping associated procedural processing information
