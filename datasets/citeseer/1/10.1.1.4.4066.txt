fusion policy analogous ordering policy regular search engine 
typical metasearch engine dog pile com uses fixed list sources combines results simply listing results original order search engines 
user relatively broad query numerous results 
metasearch engines allow limited personalization 
savvysearch allows users choose category sources specialize area considered 
example user searching news search news specific sources 
approach helps improve precision results guarantee meaningful ordering results 
addition potentially results general purpose search engines specialized ones excluded 
limitation typical metasearch engines inability score results complete content 
standard internet search engine local database considers entire contents web page making scoring decisions 
metasearch engines consider title url information short summary returned search engines

inquirus support image news queries query different search engines searching web content set 
architecture inquirus search engine source selection intelligent source selection help improve precision results opposed simply finding 
metasearch engines savvysearch metaseek profusion perform intelligent source selection 
simple example user looking current events versus user searching 
user searching news search news site user search yahoo 
current version inquirus information need category specifies list appropriate sources 
choosing sources especially results low value slow search process requiring downloading low valued content 
choosing sources increase coverage allowing users find greater number relevant pages 
method choosing sources category 
savvysearch allows users choose category news auctions search relevant sources category 
approach runs risk missing results general searched search engines 
profusion attempts predict search engines results query predicting subject 
inquirus currently uses fixed list sources category include general search engines specific needs ability automatically modify query score results predicted value need 
example user searching news normally search northern light general purpose search engine 
user specify northern light return results order date return results date range 
likewise searching altavista research papers normally return results research papers modifying query add keyword increase precision respect need research papers resulting fewer erroneous results 
inquirus acceptable search source contains low valued results uses scoring function captures specific information need allowing filter bad results
