electronic medical record systems advent systems traditionally patient medical records consisted data scattered computerized archives various locations referenced inconsistent identifiers 
information records tends obsolete redundant extent benefit patient point care 
sharing information various providers historically burdensome inefficient requiring physical duplication material 
response deficiency department health human services report strategy building national health information infrastructure suggests united states urgently needs comprehensive health information infrastructure ready access relevant reliable information greatly improve ability address personal community health concerns 
report states system technologically feasible creation marked impact effectiveness efficiency quality healthcare 
proliferation electronic medical record systems years assists realizing goal enabling medical record information sharing disparate entities involved treatment patients 
improvements communication technologies wired wireless offer improved methods transmitting information standards developed medical informatics community provide consistency formatting storing data 
example internet provides growing medium trading medical knowledge distributed health services standards organizations health level hl establishing comprehensive framework manage exchange integration retrieval electronic health information 
experts believe internet electronic patient record systems common years allowing remote access patient entire medical record 
security concerns comes personal medical records patients high expectation confidentiality implicit belief information exclusively facilitate effective care 
records contain sensitive information individual including data fertility emotional problems psychiatric treatment substance abuse physical sexual abuse genetic certain diseases 
naturally patients inherently storing communicating information electronically making available cyberspace 
various delivery networks legal jurisdictions differing regulations regarding access rights medical information generally agreed patients care providers allowed consensual access information relevant patient treatment 
sensitive nature medical record information legal obligations healthcare providers worldwide outlined data protection directive ec europe regulation japan health insurance portability accountability act united states 
mandates healthcare providers implement security procedures protect integrity confidentiality identifiable patient data monitor access protect unauthorized uses disclosures 
fundamental obstacles meeting legal requirements privacy lack comprehensive security framework addresses need authentication mapping party attributes authorization mapping attributes resource access 
common threat security electronic patient records come outside attackers supposed inappropriate accessing information authorized providers 
internal security risks include accidental disclosures poorly controlled secondary usage 
major implications healthcare institutions track instances access sensitive data including involved circumstances purpose 
reliable authentication mechanisms essential feasible 
traditional access control methods describe access conditions terms apply parties local security domain 
security domain communicating parties share pre existing relationship access criteria permission levels defined prior transaction place 
example protecting sensitive data password biometric schemes popular security techniques require communicating parties access granting system compare requestor password pre established password list 
current public key infrastructure pki systems store participants certificates centralized repository assume prior knowledge subject identity listed certificate 
significant problem arises prior relationship exists access granting service party requesting data 
example consider common situation healthcare provider requesting patient hospital authenticate request strangers preexisting relationship

trust negotiation trust negotiation solves problems associated classical authentication authorization schemes allowing individuals outside local security domain safely access sensitive data services 
enables parties perform secure transactions bilateral iterative process requesting disclosing digital credentials policies 
credentials digitally signed issuer assert veracity certain attributes owner 
digital credentials electronic analogues credentials may verify attributes identifying information licensing association memberships 
properties public key cryptography guarantee credentials unforgeable verifiable 
attribute credentials trust negotiation relies access control policies protect sensitive resources services data credentials policies unauthorized access 
specifying necessary credentials party possess order access specific resource policies provide means user may granted refused access resource real time 
associating policies particular resources allows trust negotiation thrive dynamic environment users resources constantly changing 
parties transaction may sensitive resources protected applicable policies trust negotiation occurs bilateral fashion respective parties progressively fulfilling parties policies dr jones licensed physician credential 
dr jones requests patient 
primary care physician discloses policy 
dr jones supplies requisite credential 
primary care physician discloses patient primary care physician policy granting access licensed physicians fig 

trust negotiation control access information 
iteratively making policy credential requests 
example fig 
describes scenario dr jones wishes access new patient ms sally white visiting town 
sends request office ms white primary care physician asking digitally signed medical record credential containing key sign 
authenticate requesting party primary care physician trust negotiation system responds message containing policy stating records disclosed licensed medical doctors 
order satisfy policy establish adequate trust dr jones supplies digital credential signed local medical association asserting status licensed practicing physician 
primary care physician server confirms dr jones digital credential verifying signature credential issued trusted third party national licensing association 
fulfills primary care physician policy resulting sufficient level trust complete transaction 
server encrypts ms white unique shared session key sends internet credential asserting primary care physician status licensed medical doctor 
dr jones decrypts verifies legitimacy primary care physician credential 
trust negotiation scenario provides mechanism authorized confidential transfer sally medical record
