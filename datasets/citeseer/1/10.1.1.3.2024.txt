confidentiality integrity availability important general security requirements computer networks 
availability system means accessible usable demand authorized entity performance specifications system 
words system available provides services system design users request 
accidental failures considered replication methods ensure availability 
replication malicious attacks specifically aimed loss reduction availability 
attacks commonly called denial service dos attacks 
roughly speaking types dos attacks online server distinguished bandwidth consumption attacks resource consumption attacks 
bandwidth consumption attack attacker floods server requests server overloaded accept requests legitimate clients anymore 
resource consumption attack attacker sends requests server server uses resources process requests longer accept requests legitimate clients 
course flooding server may lead exhaustion server resources processes launched serve requests depending type service provided server carefully constructed requests may effect 
concerned resource consumption attacks 
interestingly simply authenticating clients may turn useful resource consumption attack 
authentication procedure may involve expensive operations terms resource consumption server side engaging multiple parallel instances authentication protocol may consume server resources 
approach alleviates problem client puzzles 
idea engaging resource consuming operations server sends puzzle client solve puzzle send result back server 
server continues processing client request may involve resource consuming operations received correct response puzzle 
approach resource consumption attacks impossible expensive attacker sense successful attacks require considerably resources attacker
