order fully understand factors influencing usability mobile setting elements user task interface environment need considered 
interactions various elements result distinct settings different usability requirements consequently different suitable interfaces 
propose new ubiquitous usability model incorporates elements shown 
user task interface environment elements classified various types exhibit variety limitations influence impact usability mobile experience setting 
types limitations elements discussed detail 
user user central model typically determines mobile task completed particular interface environmental context 
user types 
users may broadly classified characteristics schemes 
common classifications literature 
novice expert expertise considered aspects experience task domain system computers devices general 
ample evidence support intuitive notion domain experts behave differently novices 
experts just know know differently 
experts better able organize data meaningful chunks rich set structures characterize new problems 
experts tend take top approaches problem solving novices tend bottom approaches lack comprehensive planning 
interface system expert users quickly form goals sequences actions achieve goals 
prefer interaction efficient terms time required actions 
novice users hand prefer interface easy helps guess appropriate action 
environment types static dynamic quiet noisy environment limitations distractions ambient conditions time user types novice expert sequential multitasking user limitations memory capacity visual capacity motor skill capacity environment user interface task environment ubiquitous usability model interface types hierarchical menu short cut codes tree table speech interface limitations screen size quality input methods varied devices task types closed open accessing authoring task limitations complexity interaction level sequential multi tasking psychologists led concept left brain right brain orientation 
left brain generally associated sequential processing right brain generally associated spatial ability multi tasking 
users oriented multi tasking may easily interact mobile device interacting environment talking watching tv walking user limitations 
performing mobile tasks tasks humans limited memory visual motor skill capacities 
constraints explored 
memory capacity miller chunking magic number emphasized humans extremely limited information recall memory 
greater capacity recognition selecting relevant item larger list recall remembering item cues 
mobile interface forces user recall specific commands infrequently may difficult cognitively due human memory limitations 
visual capacity visual capacities perceptions vary individuals visual stimuli environments 
example sensitive colour blue especially age peripheral vision dominant dim lighting red objects appear closer blue objects 
visual processing may highly dependent user expectations 
example user expects particular image similar different expectation may override visual input leading user incorrectly process image 
system mobile interfaces carefully designed account visual capacities perceptions mobile device users 
motor skill capacity measures human motor skills include speed accuracy important design interactive systems 
fitts law states time taken hit target menu item button icon function size target distance moved 
users find difficult manipulate small objects targets large possible distance moved small possible 
mobile devices characterized small screen displays challenged trying targets large possible 
large targets small screen greatly limit number objects displayed 
environment ubiquitous mobile systems varying environments 
usability systems impacted context 
environment types 
environments may broadly classified characteristics 
environmental classifications applicable ubiquitous usability 
static dynamic static mobile environment user engaged applications stationary sitting airport 
dynamic mobile environment hand user engaged mobile applications moving walking mall 
dynamic environment imposes challenges user user interface 
quiet noisy quiet mobile environment characterized minimal audio visual interferences 
noisy mobile environment hand suffers high level interferences 
mobile tasks typically performed outside settings office home user control level noise environment 
example mobile user experience higher level interference mobile tasks walking noisy street traffic compared working privacy quiet office 
noisy interactive environment mobile user distracted noise communication individuals engaging mobile task obviously impose additional constraints ability user focus solely mobile task hand 
environment limitations 
environment may pose limitations influence task performance ubiquitous mobile system 
limitations explored 
distractions limitations arise due dynamic nature typical mobile environment 
mobile user operating environment potentially subjected distractions due various stimuli compete attention interacting mobile applications 
stimuli include presence noise levels 
ambient conditions mobile applications performed suboptimal environmental conditions poor high luminance extreme temperatures 
mobile users limited control conditions 
conditions may change suddenly warning 
example users surfing web pda lit conditions suddenly find total darkness train passes dark tunnel 
time substantial research suggests faced time pressure users process information selectively complex decision strategies 
miller proposed major ways coping time pressed situations acceleration users process information faster rate 
errors may occur due temporary overload memory processing capacity 
avoidance users process information rate simply time run 
may result incomplete tasks poor decisions due incomplete information 
filtration users chose ne subjectively important data consideration 
cognitive process altered result time pressure 
mobile environment users short periods time complete wireless activities tasks decision making capabilities may altered limited 
limitation gains added importance consider mobile user typically paying accessing mobile applications minute 
task addition user environmental considerations usability mobile environment influenced characteristics task 
task types 
tasks may broadly classified characteristics outlined 
closed open closed task specific objective decomposed sub goals 
open task general objective considered exploratory vague non specific compared closed tasks 
searching specific stock price mobile device considered closed task browsing news site stories may interest considered open task 
accessing authoring access task mobile user engaged programmed processing sequence known steps retrieve available information 
authoring task mobile user engaged emergent processing steps unfold intermediate results order generate new information 
example retrieving latest news considered access task sending email message authoring task 
task limitations 
task may pose limitations influence usability ubiquitous mobile systems 
limitations outlined 
complexity complexity task determined nature scope level user involvement required 
additionally availability volume accuracy structure data greatly impact complexity task 
generally mobile users access limited amount information compared regular internet users 
limited information bind types tasks successfully completed mobile devices 
types information may available 
quantity information leads information overload mobile user may longer comprehend information due sheer volume combined mobile device limitations 
additionally wired web information mobile setting may opinion fact data maintenance may considered priority 
unstructured information may impose additional cognitive burdens user task completion 
mobile setting additional complexity may exist environment reducing task complexity gains increased importance 
interaction level tasks may require higher level interaction online games compared weather forecast requests 
mobile setting environmental distractions limited input mechanisms hinder interaction highly interactive tasks may difficult accomplish
