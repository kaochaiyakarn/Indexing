reputation mechanisms promising approach reducing incentive free ride types systems clearly require peers know identities 
anonymity communication protocols identity free rider obscured service system designed provide 
despite aforementioned issues efforts applying reputation mechanisms anonymous systems 
particular dingledine gives overview different systems enhanced reputation mechanisms 
remailer networks system reputation mechanism cluster nodes provide reliable service users authors address issue free riding 
authors describe attempts couple anonymous publishing system project reputation mechanism prevent free riding publishing content providing reliable storage space 
cases complexity degree centralization systems significantly increased addition reputation mechanisms 
difficulties encountered suggest conventional reputation mechanisms suitable prevent free anonymous systems 
important understand economic forces drive users participate peer peer system 
broad discussion economics costs benefits anonymity systems discussed 
authors enumerate economic forces balance model understand implications user actions 
simplified model show circumstances system feasible cost anonymity exceeds benefits 
authors suggest incentive provide alternative reputation mechanisms cover excess costs propose scheme observation 
payments promote cooperation proposed peer peer systems anonymity systems 
deployed peer peer network robust file storage retrieval peers traded form private currency called mojo exchange storage retrieval data 
main intent requiring exchange limit individual peer ability cause denial service excessively consuming resources hubaux advocate payment scheme promoting cooperation mobile ad hoc networks 
authors propose system exchanging private currency service show incentive mechanism push system equilibrium point peers cooperate 
implementation approach requires participating peers tamper proof hardware enforce honest exchange payments 
zhong chen yang propose payment scheme called sprite encourage cooperation mobile ad hoc networks 
system require specialized hardware centralized record keeping authority cryptographic scheme deferred payments 
game theoretic analysis establishes prices set appropriately rational peers behave truthfully cheating collusion better option 
crowcroft consider payment scheme ad hoc networks focus problem setting individual prices service distributed fashion 
despite fact ad hoc networks anonymous communication protocols provide data forwarding service applications different requirements respective users different utility functions 
ad hoc networks local battery power bandwidth scarce resources anonymous systems issue 
anonymity fear scrutiny comes helping engage dubious activity issue ad hoc networks 
primary system requirement anonymous system preserve identity peer efficient data transmission goal ad hoc networks 
mind differs important respects related ad hoc networks 
particular ensure exchange currency enable attacker compromise anonymity 
centralized accounting reveal identity users involved transaction central authority 
chosen reject requirements specialized hardware constrain scale deployment ultimately limit number participants desirable anonymous protocols 
instructive contrast anonymous communication system application seti home 
seti home performs massively parallel computation leveraging cpu resources contributed numerous volunteers receive little compensation listed heavy contributor apparently behave 
systems fundamentally different anonymous peer peer systems 
importantly cooperation communication participating nodes required order contribute system contribution consists solely local computations 
benefits perceived volunteer largely unaffected actions may join leave frequently contribute little time 
notion free rider exist idea currency limit power attackers developed collaborators 
seti home registered users users active hour period statistics user participates contributes 
systems explicit incentive structure little benefit 
background digital cash way peer peer system encourage cooperative behavior requiring exchange token return service 
think token peer requesting service evidence past cooperation 
mechanism robust fraud token irrefutable typically requires issued trusted third party peers prevented reusing previously spent tokens 
furthermore tokens transferable sense token issuer exchanged new token presenter may acquire service 
ensure anonymity impossible token issuer link individual token peer initially requested token 
mechanisms issuing exchanging tokens exist form digital cash schemes developed decade 
reasonable consider mechanisms easily adopted provide incentives anonymous communication systems 
propose incentive mechanism extensive digital cash fundamental properties 
digital cash mature field research promising practical idea despite failure initial attempts bring digital cash public domain 
reason failure meager demand digital cash attributable lack applications required 
digital cash infrastructures currently exist public domain systems extensive digital cash proposed increase demand accelerate deployment 
assume existence publicly accessible authority issuing digital cash call bank digital cash mechanism fairly standard properties 
note bank need centralized entity single administration long different entities recognize value currency 
important property digital cash mechanism renders relationship payer purchases untraceable bank payee 
ideally transaction reveal partial information payer 
digital cash mechanism implementable solely software rely tamper proof hardware smart card 
payments digital cash line line 
line payments require interaction bank transaction occurs 
allows bank prevent malicious users repeatedly spending unit currency different 
line payments involve bank time transaction detect double spending fact 
line payment schemes provide double spend cryptographic payment protocols reveal identity payer unit currency double spent spent 
line payment protocols require challenge response interaction payee payer 
alternative general digital cash issue private form cash anonymity system 
advocate public bank primarily difficulty preventing side exchanges private cash secondarily reduce complexity anonymity system external issuer cash 
issues discussed detail

line line digital cash systems incentive mechanism follows fully designed description 
system design describing proposed incentive mechanism review basic operation mix network initially proposed chaum forms basis anonymous protocols proposed 
recursive encryption characteristic mixes fundamental requirement mechanism 
simplified mix network peer wishing send anonymous message known initiator destination constructs path set collaborating peers system 
peer path responsible forwarding message ultimate destination initiator selects intermediary peers path possibly random respective public keys constructs message recursively encrypted form 

address th peer path path length denotes message encrypted public key onion routing recursively encrypted message known onion adopt nomenclature subsequent text 
constructing onion initiator forwards peer path intermediary peer path access payload decrypting message private key

eventually message reaches node path forwards message destination peers forward response reverse path 
essence proposed scheme embed small digital cash payment hop anonymous path 
initiator includes payment th hop path encrypted payload destined hop 
inherent source routing mechanism initiator determining anonymous path provided protocol particularly suited integration payment mechanism initiator safely embed payment hop path 
consider possible extensions anonymous protocols support digital cash payments line payment line payment see section

payment node encrypted symmetric key generated initiator accessible node 
receiving message node sends encrypted symmetric key predecessor acknowledgment message enabling previous hop obtain payment

protocol line payments line protocol differs line version mainly node interacts bank 
interacting bank time payment received node accumulate payments batch point time example node idle leave system 
recall detection double spending line digital cash requires payee issue challenge payer 
payer remain anonymous provide mechanism forward challenge intermediate nodes back initiator reverse path 
challenges suitably encrypted initiator read 
forwarding message destination hop creates message containing encrypted challenge sends reverse path 
note key encrypt challenge symmetric key generated initiator encrypt payment node 
node reverse path appends encrypted challenge message travels initiator receives message containing encrypted challenges intermediate nodes 
receiving message challenges initiator constructs onion containing response hop

line version line protocol uses encrypted cash encrypted keys returned acknowledgments nodes forward requests order receive payment 
illustrates operation line protocol 
line protocol advantages potentially reduce overhead associated bank interactions reduce ability bank break anonymity 
issues discussed sections 
attacks anonymity important understand new attacks anonymity system introduced payment mechanism proposed 
clearly bank new potential attacker peers bank possible 
argue bank trivially able reveal identity initiator 
anonymous property digital cash prevent bank linking cash payment peer cash issued 
sophisticated bank traffic analysis correlate issue digital cash peer peers 
line version protocol particularly vulnerable attack peers receiving payment immediately contact bank 
counteract traffic analysis initiator buy large sums digital cash small cash units infrequently opposed requesting bank issue digital cash message time scale 
line protocol subject attack peers exchange payments received point time possibly randomly infrequently 
furthermore bank nodes initiator trivially revealed 
bank add definite information colluding nodes know best join efforts performing traffic analysis 
case traffic analysis stronger events correlated counteract similar ideas 
envision bank public accessible authority providing digital cash services various entities making traffic analysis payments harder transactions anonymous protocol interleaved uncorrelated transactions 
line protocol subject attack initiator careful 
order prevent double spending digital cash identity initiator revealed initiator provides response different challenges digital cash payment 
careful initiator providing responses different challenges digital cash safely issue response digital cash payment 
mechanism provides necessary incentives reduce number free riders see section known attacks anonymity harder 
increasing average number peers system reducing average turnover rate increase degree anonymity provide resistant system 
example consider predecessor intersection attacks anonymous systems 
attacks take advantage time varying membership system effective smaller average number peers higher turnover rate 
providing incentive participate system attacks effective rate path establishment decreases fewer broken paths group membership changes slowly 
ask free rider subject attacks peer cooperates 
case implicit incentive free rider cooperate protecting identity 
clear case peer subject attacks unilaterally decides free ride 
increased resistance attacks requires peers collectively decision explicit incentive order drive system direction 
introducing payment system allow malicious users attempt exploit system order gain money 
new attacks designed obtain digital cash system emerge 
aware trivial effective attack possible colluding set malicious users pose threat system 
observation inherently limits effectiveness attacks fact anonymous path defined solely initiator reducing chances colluding nodes appearing path 
trust malicious behavior problem exchanging digital products digital cash message forwarding parties necessarily trust widely studied years 
protocols guarantee success transactions known fair exchange protocols number proposed literature 
efficient protocols avoid fact disputes rely common trusted third party 
protocols trusted third party high communication overhead unreasonable assumptions requiring parties identical computing power limiting practicality 
fair exchange protocols complicated anonymity required parties 
system proposed potentially existing fair exchange protocol provides anonymity parties choose sake system simplicity accept certain amount inherent distrust parties involved transaction 
distrust tolerated peer participated unfair transaction misbehaving party explain 
possibility retaliation motivate peers behave fairly engaging transaction 
possible stronger punishment mechanisms misbehaving nodes needed leave question investigations 
possibility reputation mechanism suggested discriminate nodes bad behavior 
protocol described assumes payer payee trusted particular transaction 
example initiator trusted provide valid digital cash intermediate peers peer forwards message receive key payment 
payment invalid peer refusing forward subsequent requests path refusing forward response messages back initiator causing path broken forcing initiator create new path 
initiator continuously misbehaves able receive responses destination create new anonymous path request 
creation new path known reveal information initiator identity predecessor intersection attacks 
initiators presumably value anonymity incentive behave honestly respect issuing payments 
trust relationship inverted transaction initiator peer path 
case peer trusted provide service receives payment prior forwarding message final destination 
hop misbehaves initiator declaring broken path creating new include hop 
peer continuously misbehaves appear paths formed reducing amount money receives system 
trust relationship peer hop neighbor 
peer trusts successor return acknowledgment key encrypted payment 
misbehaving neighbor neglect 
gained behavior certainly additional cash self interested peer engage action 
form retaliation peer receive key forwarding requests responses creating broken path force initiator create new path 
hope misbehaving peer eventually appear fewer anonymous paths 
paying responses system design far focused providing payment initiator intermediate nodes forward path path taken message travels destination 
implicitly assumed joined system nodes behave cooperatively forwarding responses destination reverse path 
take care payments forward path create undesirable incentive remain joined behave collecting payments properly forwarding response messages 
initiator response message dropped intermediate node unable identify individual node fault declare path broken create new path entirely disjoint original 
desirable incentives prevent nodes dropping responses 
reasonable idea consider splitting payment forward reverse paths 
initiator embed encrypted payments intermediate node path giving keys forward reverse payments node successor predecessor respectively 
successor returns forward key acknowledgment request message described predecessor returns reverse key similar way response message passed back initiator 
additional complexity needed prevent colluding neighbor providing reverse key response comes back 
main drawbacks approach initiator trust hop path behave honestly withholding additional key required reverse path response returned forwarding original request proper destination ii initiator provide payment proportional size response best able estimate value 
alternative approach initiator embed forward payments request provide reverse payments separate recursively encrypted messages received response piggybacked request sends 
obviously allow initiator pay proportion size response require intermediate nodes place trust anonymous initiator wait payments service provided 
course intermediate nodes punish initiator non payment dropping subsequent requests forcing initiator create new path described best interest 
feel second approach outlined response payments separate message appropriate reasons provides flexibility having payments proportional size responses 
second retaliation potentially effective initiator anonymity having create multiple paths 
third extent paths long lasting opportunity piggyback payments realistic overheard small 
intend explore describe mechanism detail due lack space 
topic reverse path payments fully 
performance delays payment mechanism proposed clearly introduce additional communication computation overheads existing anonymous system materialize form delays 
additional overhead message generated forwarded system 
line protocol nodes path required forward acknowledgment predecessor decrypt payment contact bank deposit digital cash 
line protocol node needs generate encrypt challenge forward back initiator receive verify corresponding response point time contact bank 
assume scenario computation resources plentiful additional delays dominated transactions 
particular line line protocols transactions node bank node initiator respectively dominate additional delays 
note types transactions occur parallel waiting response message destination masking actual delay imposed transaction 
expect perceived additional delay imposed protocols small 
digital cash impose overheads bank contacted order issue digital cash initiator issuing anonymous digital cash requires processing exchange messages 
mitigate delay nodes buy digital cash large batches prior establishing anonymous communication
