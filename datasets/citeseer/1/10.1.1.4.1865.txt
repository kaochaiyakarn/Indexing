project management section takes broader management view annotation presents functions connect anvil outer resources import export

import import anvil offers functions

export anvil provides export functions 
export track plain text 
export speech transcription text file rst encoding import rst markup 
second importantly anvil offers extraction track number files project single text table statistical analysis standard software packages spss 
table comprises track elements lines

related annotation multiple layers common practice 
bas format early example multiple layer format entities dialogue acts point called canonical layer word level 
comfortable file format storing annotated entities single lines turns single files 
support proper tools sparsely provided 
slightly outdated storage uses plain text annotation entities mere labels strings opposed objects attribute value pairs 
generation annotation projects java xml file exchange objectoriented design atlas project deals questions annotation theoretically idea annotation graphs reminiscent word hypothesis lattices known speech recognition nodes times points edges annotation labels words 
edges spanning nodes represent higher level entities dialogue acts syntactic phrases 
atlas framework offers logical view annotations form accessible api ensure extensibility researchers 
query language selective extraction devised 
project looks highly promising early stage terms implementation 
effort allow multi user annotation centrally located corpus web interface 
finished tool allow multi modal video annotation 
moment viewer accessible 
earlier tool called various research institutes requires special hardware software setup 
mate annotation workbench allows highly generic specification stylesheets determine look functionality user tool implementation 
stylesheets offer powerful retrieval mechanisms annotated entities 
speed stability tool problematic real annotation 
highly generic approach increases initial effort set tool basically write tool mate stylesheet language 
conclude anvil compares related ambitious complete atlas theoretical framework retrieval analysis functions generic mate stylesheets multi user web 
hand running easy install continually improved insights practical annotation 

anvil generic tool annotation multimodal discourse 
generic multi layered approach allows annotation elements attribute value pairs including cross level pointers elements 
anvil fast comes intuitive easy interface 
researchers dealing multimodal discourse exploratory studies annotation large corpora 
analyzing mass data supported export feature encoded data accessible spss statistics toolkits 
core functionality anvil quite complete running system easy install robust 
rim room 
specification tracks attribute values done xml quite easy managed editor 
furthermore project manager added needs elaboration insertion information coders date 
export function text tables extended want related elements related temporal overlap cross level linkage appear line checking correlation hypotheses
