section possible directions 
multi layered database model philosophy construction information abstraction assumes users may read details large pieces information may scan general description information 
motivation web page restructuring weblog weboql web page content web page inter relations abstraction 
multiple layered database consists major components database schema contains metainformation layered database structures set concept hierarchies set generalized database relations layers les primitive global information base 
rst component database schema outlines database structure 
stores general information structures types ranges data statistics relations di erent layers relationships associated attributes location layers reside 
describes higher layer relation generalized lower layer relation generalization performed 
presents route map data meta data browsing 
second component set concept hierarchies provides set prede ned concept hierarchies assist system generalize lower layer information high layer ones map queries appropriate concept layers processing 
hierarchies query browsing resources drill roll operations 
third component consists information base primitive information level layer generalized database relations layers 
third component de nition dynamic 
schema de ned rst component model enriched new elds new route maps de ned system initially conceived 
updates incremental propagated case schema update lower layers higher ones 
new concept hierarchies de ned updated 
updates current concept hierarchies imply incremental updates layered structure new concept hierarchies may suggest de nition new set layers analogue 
diversity information stored global information base di cult realistic create relational database structures primitive layer information base 
possible create relational structures store reasonably structured information generalized primitive layer information 
example accessing patterns accessing frequency information base layer organized dozens database relations document person organization software map library catalog commercial data geographic data scienti data game relationships relations constructed explicitly creating relationship relations entity relationship model person organization implicitly adding linkages tuples entity relation formation layer adding urls uniform resource locator 
notice incremental updating schema adding new attributes layer may imply incremental updating propagating lower layer information higher ones multiple layered database may require incremental updates layer building softwares 
construction structure goal construction transform generalize unstructured data primitive layer site relatively structured data manageable retrievable database technology 
specialized tools similar essence executed locally information provider sites extract pertinent data documents 
weblog weboql query languages exploited gather needed information documents 
information stored rst layer generalized higher levels 
layer distributed resides locally information provider site 
higher levels gathered centralized location mirrored better performance 
extracting information structured bibtex les postscript papers fairly smooth 
web pages don easily convey needed information 
extensible markup language xml developed world wide web consortium help direction 
web publishing tools adopting xml help promote widespread improved structured web documents 
dublin metadata workshop stressed importance metadata document descriptors networked documents facilitate resource discovery 
extensions html speci cations include tags allowing description keywords content summary inside html document 
search engines ranking documents web document authors willing manually add descriptions web pages 
simplify discussion assume layer database contains extended relations document person 
relations constructed generalized similarly 

document le addr authors title publication pub date language table contents category description keywords index urls multimedia attached num pages form size doc time stamp access frequency 

person name rst name home page addr position picture attached phone mail ce address education research interests publications size home page timestamp access frequency 
take document relation example 
tuple relation abstraction document information base 
relation detailed abstraction descriptor information documents gathered site 
relations layer substantially smaller primitive layer information base rich preserve interesting pieces general information diverse community users browse query 
layer relations document person generalized layer database 
resulting relations usually smaller attributes records 
popular elds layer dropped remaining elds inherited layer relations 
relations split di erent classi cation schemes tuples merged relying successive subsumptions concept hierarchies 
general concept hierarchies provided explicitly domain experts 
hierarchies built automatically stored implicitly database 
implemented propose forthcoming technique construction concept hierarchy keywords extracted web pages enriched wordnet semantic network 
due lack space discuss construction generalization problem refer reader details 
web mining language similar extended relational database systems system treats requests information browsing resource discovery relational queries 
concepts generalized di erent layers search conditions query may match exactly concept level currently available layer database 
example nd documents related particular topic attribute oriented induction query may put term search key 
current layer may contain terms corresponding higher concept level induction techniques data mining methods 
case nd current layer exact match provided search key nd general concept absorbs search key 
hand search key query may general concept level current layer 
example search key sports conceptually covers term baseball match database 
key oriented search leads introduce additional relational operations extend semantics traditional selection join 
relationships coverage subsumption synonymy approximation 
operators correspondent language primitive de ned respectively covers

examples mentioned earlier structure provides ground resource discovery internet pinpointing relevant documents knowledge discovery implicit knowledge extraction 
examples queries resource discovery data mining web 
example query list documents published europe related data mining follows 
list document europe related computing science keywords covered data mining notice keyword list indicates query brie browse information searches relations clause constraint 
select list locate set url addresses required documents important attributes documents 
keyword list allows display document attributes high conceptual level provides olap interaction 
document indicate nd document relation layer layer indicates nd top layer document relation ts query 
document clue system nd appropriate relation high layer 
adopt convention system responsibility nd best match unreasonable ask users remember relation names di erent layers 
related clause help system locate appropriate top layer relation case relations split topic 
execute query system uses phrase document related computing science locate top layer relation cs document example 
phrase keywords covered data mining means exists entry set keywords subsumed data mining 
phrase europe con nes search europe mapped concrete countries concept hierarchy internet domains 
case relatively large set answers returned 
interactive process deepen search usually initiated users browsing answer set 
example inquire european universities productive publishing line popular documents related database systems query follows select liation document europe liation belong university keywords covered database systems publication year count access frequency belong high query productive measured containing published papers internet related database systems obtained result initial browsing document table justi ed interactive queries 
term high generalization numeric value access frequency concept hierarchy 
interesting note execution query return list document list universities publishing popular documents databases knowledge extracted conglomerate documents 
example suppose query describe general characteristics relevance authors publications documents popular internet data mining 
knowledge discovery query answer request characterized keyword describe shown 
mine description relevance authors liation publication pub date document related computing science keywords data mining access frequency high discovery query rst executed retrieval collect cs document data relevant authors liation publication pub date satisfy clause 
attribute oriented induction performed collected data generalizes publication groups major ai journals major database conferences generalizes publication date year generalized results collected datacube interactively manipulated user olap operations 
example classify update time popularity documents published line sites canadian commercial internet domain information retrieval internet query follows mine classi cation timestamp access frequency relevance document canada commercial keywords covered information retrieval keywords internet publication year phrase mine classi cation requests classi cation tree system 
query rst collects relevant set data relations executes data classi cation algorithm classify documents access frequency modi cation date presents class associated characteristics tree 
user navigate tree representation drill documents needed 
search engines currently available internet answers lists presumably relevant documents 
allow solve resource discovery issues presenting lists relevant documents users allowing users progressively interactively browse detailed information leading targeted set pertinent documents 
queries treated information probes mapped relatively high concept layer answered hierarchical manner 
knowledge discovery power unique 
helps nd interesting high level information global information base 
provides users high level view database statistical information relevant answer set associative summary information di erent layers 
addition model takes advantage web page restructuring query languages available networked agents retrieve pertinent descriptors web documents 
experiments run locally collection line documents promising
