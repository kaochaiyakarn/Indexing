context provider needs registered service registry service locating service mechanism discovered 
external context providers obtain contexts external sources weather information server able provide weather information particular place road traffic provider provides traffic information particular area 
internal context providers acquire contexts directly ubiquitous sensors located sub domain vehicle environment 
example location provider provide location vehicle acquired vehicle gps receiver 
different context providers acquire various context data internal physical sensors external virtual sensors represent context events form owl descriptions
