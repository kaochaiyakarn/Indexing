widely studied methods inducing relational patterns inductive logic programming ilp :10.1.1.35.951
ilp concerns induction horn clause rules order logic logic programs data order logic 
discusses going applying ilp link discovery part project 

inductive logic programming ilp ilp study learning methods data rules represented order predicate logic 
predicate logic allows quantified variables relations represent concepts expressible examples described feature vectors 
relational database easily translated order logic source data ilp 
example consider rules written prolog syntax appears define uncle relation uncle brother parent 
uncle husband sister parent 
goal inductive logic programming ilp infer rules sort database background facts logical definitions relations :10.1.1.35.951
example ilp system learn rules uncle target predicate set positive negative examples uncle relationships set facts relations parent brother sister husband background predicates members extended family uncle tom frank uncle bob john uncle tom cindy uncle bob tom parent bob frank parent cindy frank parent alice john parent tom john brother tom cindy sister cindy tom husband tom alice husband bob cindy 
alternatively rules logically define brother sister relations supplied relationships inferred complete set facts basic predicates parent spouse gender 
rules order logic formally referred horn clauses 
formal definition ilp problem follows set horn clauses 
positive examples set horn clauses typically ground literals 
negative examples set horn clauses typically ground literals 
find hypothesis set horn clauses completeness consistency variety algorithms ilp problem developed applied variety important datamining problems 
relational data mining remains appreciated topic larger kdd community
