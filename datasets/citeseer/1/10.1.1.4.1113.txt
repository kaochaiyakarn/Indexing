ideally programming paradigm allows program sensor network single virtual entity focusing individual nodes 
providing easy abstractions hand paradigm allow efficient implementation wide variety different applications 
typically tradeoffs level abstraction expressiveness efficiency implementations 
restricted resources 
sensor nodes suffer limited resources energy computing power memory communication bandwidth 
middleware components lightweight fit constraints 
middleware provide support dynamically adapt performance resource consumption varying needs application example enabling dynamic tradeoffs output quality resource consumption 
anticipated sensor network execute multiple applications concurrently middleware provide mechanisms optimize resource allocation system performance 
network dynamics 
ad hoc networks sensor nodes may exhibit highly dynamic network topology due node mobility environmental obstructions resulting communication failures truck driving hardware failures depleted batteries stepping device 
middleware support robust operation sensor networks despite dynamics adapting changing network environment 
prominent approach data centric communication network nodes longer addressed unique identifiers specifying function data provide device vicinity measure temperature allowing automatic failover device characteristics similar failed 
scale deployments 
sensor nodes smaller cheaper sensor networks anticipated consist thousands millions individual nodes 
precludes manual configuration maintenance fixing upgrading individual devices due huge number 
middleware support mechanisms self maintenance collections sensor nodes 
extreme case starting totally symmetric situation devices identical initially possess unique identifiers collection devices self configure order achieve operational state set network topology assign tasks devices collaboratively merge evaluate collected data 
mechanisms try achieve certain global structure state network impossible apply global approaches flooding network achieve due scalability reasons 
fortunately possible approximate global goal localized mechanisms devices interact close neighborhood 
real world integration

additionally applications subject real time constraints example sensor network report certain state real world certain amount time 
middleware may include real time mechanisms 
collection processing sensory data 
collection processing sensory data core func tionality sensor networks 
complex sensing tasks require data collected nodes fused obtain high level sensing result 
limited resources preclude centralized data processing requires transferring bulky raw sensor data nodes network 
sensory data preprocessed source extract features relevant application 
preprocessed data multiple sources fused aggregated network flows user reducing communication energy overhead 
techniques degree blur clear separation communication data processing typically traditional distributed systems

discuss tinydb representative class 
tinydb supports single virtual database table sensors column corresponds specific type sensor temperature light source input data sensor node identifier remaining battery power 
reading sensors node regarded appending new row sensors 
query language subset sql extensions 
consider query example 
rooms equipped multiple sensor nodes 
sensor node equipped sensors measure acoustic volume 
table sensors contains columns room room number sensor floor floor room located 
determine rooms th floor average volume exceeds threshold query select avg volume room sensors floor group room having avg volume epoch duration query selects rows sensors th floor floor 
selected rows grouped room number group room 
average volume resulting groups calculated avg volume 
groups average volume having avg volume kept 
remaining groups pair average volume respective room number select avg volume room returned 
query seconds epoch duration resulting stream query results 
tinydb uses decentralized approach sensor node query processor preprocesses aggregates sensor data way sensor node user 
executing query involves steps firstly spanning tree network rooted user device constructed maintained network topology changes controlled flooding approach 
flood messages roughly synchronize time nodes network 
secondly query broadcast nodes network sending tree root leafs 
process time schedule established parent children agree time interval parent listen data children 
epoch leaf nodes obtain new table row reading local sensors 
apply select criteria row 
criteria fulfilled socalled partial state record created contains necessary data room number floor number average volume example 
partial state record sent parent scheduled time interval 
parent listens partial state records children scheduled interval 
parent proceeds children reading sensors applying select criteria generating partial state record need 
parent aggregates partial state record records received children calculates average volume example resulting new partial state record 
new partial state record sent parent parent scheduled interval 
process iterates root tree 
root final partial state record evaluated obtain query result 
procedure repeats epoch

send takes node address message parameters sends message specified sensor node 
node addresses currently consist unique node id script name additional identifiers distinguish copies script 
command takes sensor node addresses parameters spawns copies executing script specified remote sensor nodes 
node addresses unique node identifiers broadcast nodes transmission range 
command checks remote sensor node executing specified script 
case options instruct runtime system existing remote script handle additional user create copy script 
occurrence asynchronous activity reception message expiry timer represented specific event 
command expects set event names parameters suspends execution script specified events occurs 
script simplified version tinydb query calculates maximum volume rooms sensor nodes network set children replicate set num children children set num replies set query volume value wait msg body set msg body incr num replies num replies num children send parent exit script replicates nodes communication range 
copies created nodes running script 
replicate command returns list newly infected sensor nodes children

loop wait blocks radio message received 
message body stored variable msg body 
updated received value reply counter incremented
