non compliance nodes section discusses concerns vulnerability ecn non compliant nodes nodes set ect bit transmitted packets respond received ce packets 
argue addition ecn ip architecture significantly increase current vulnerability architecture unresponsive flows 
non ecn environments serious concerns damage done non compliant unresponsive flows flows respond congestion control indications reducing arrival rate congested link 
example node turn congestion control reducing congestion window response packet drops 
concern current internet 
argued routers deploy mechanisms detect differentially treat packets non compliant flows 
argued techniques flow scheduling isolation flow differentiated services reservations remove damaging effects unresponsive flows 
argued dropping packets may adequate deterrent non compliance ecn removes deterrent 
argue response ecn capable routers preserve packet dropping behavior times high congestion times high congestion dropping packets adequate deterrent non compliance 
ecn capable routers mark packets opposed dropping packet marking rate reasonably low 
periods average queue size exceeds upper threshold potential packet marking rate high recommendation routers drop packets set ce bit packet headers 
periods low moderate packet marking rates ecn deployed little deterrent effect unresponsive flows dropping marking packets 
example delay insensitive flows reliable delivery incentive increase decrease sending rate presence dropped packets 
similarly delay sensitive flows unreliable delivery increase fec response increased packet drop rate increasing decreasing ramakrishnan floyd experimental page rfc ecn ip january sending rate 
reasons believe packet dropping effective deterrent non compliance environment high packet drop rates 
methods proposed identify restrict unresponsive flows 
addition ecn network environment way increase difficulty designing deploying mechanisms 
addition ecn architecture job identifying unresponsive flows slightly easier 
example ecn capable environment routers limited information packets dropped ce bit set router environment routers take note arriving ce packets indicate congestion encountered packet earlier path 

non compliance network breakdown effective congestion control caused non compliant node loss congestion indication network 
happen rogue broken router set ect bit packet non ecn capable transport erased ce bit arriving packets 
example rogue broken router erased ce bit arriving ce packets prevent indication congestion reaching downstream receivers 
result failure congestion control flow resulting increase congestion network ultimately resulting subsequent packets dropped flow average queue size increased congested gateway 
actions rogue broken router result unnecessary indication congestion nodes 
actions include router dropping packet setting ce bit absence congestion 
congestion control point view setting ce bit absence congestion non compliant router different router dropping packet 
erasing ect bit packet dropped network router actions result unnecessary packet drop packet network 
concerns regarding loss congestion indications encapsulated dropped corrupted packets discussed 
ramakrishnan floyd experimental page rfc ecn ip january 
encapsulated packets care required handle ce ect bits appropriately packets encapsulated de encapsulated tunnels 
packet encapsulated rules apply regarding ect bit 
ect bit encapsulated inside header ect bit encapsulating outside header 
ect bit inside header ect bit outside header 
packet de encapsulated rules apply regarding ce bit 
ect bit inside outside header ce bit outside header ored ce bit inside header 
case ce bit outside header copied inside header 
ect bit header ce bit outside header ignored 
requirement treatment de encapsulated packets currently apply ipsec tunnels 
specific example ecn encapsulation occurs flow wishes ecn capability avoid danger unnecessary packet drop encapsulated packet result congestion intermediate node tunnel 
functionality supported copying ecn field inner ip header outer ip header encapsulation ecn field outer ip header set ecn field inner ip header 
effectively allows routers tunnel cause ce bit set ecn field ip header ecn capable packet routers experience congestion 

ipsec tunnel considerations ipsec protocol defined esp ah include ip header ecn field cryptographic calculations case tunnel mode outer ip header ecn field included 
modification ecn field network node effect ipsec security cause ipsec integrity check fail 
consequence ipsec provide defense adversary modification ecn field man middle attack adversary modification effect ipsec security 
environments ability modify ecn field affecting ipsec integrity checks may constitute covert channel necessary eliminate channel reduce bandwidth outer ip header ecn field zeroed tunnel ingress egress nodes 
ramakrishnan floyd experimental page rfc ecn ip january ipsec protocol currently requires inner header ecn field changed ipsec processing tunnel egress node 
ensures adversary modifications ecn field launch theft denial service attacks ipsec tunnel endpoint modifications discarded tunnel endpoint 
document change ipsec requirement

ipsec specifications modified permit tunnel egress node modify ecn field inner ip header ecn field value outer header copying part outer ecn field inner ecn field permit ecn field outer ip header zeroed encapsulation experiments ecn may combination ipsec tunneling

dropped corrupted packets additional issue concerns packet ce bit set router dropped subsequent router 
proposed ecn transport protocol tcp dropped data packet indication congestion nodes detect dropped data packets congestion response nodes dropped data packet strong congestion response received ce packet 
transport protocols tcp necessarily detect packet drops drop pure ack packet example tcp reduce arrival rate subsequent ack packets response earlier dropped ack packet
