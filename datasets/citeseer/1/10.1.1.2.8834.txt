flexible interface migration fabio patern cnr pisa italy fabio paterno cnr different ways 
mobile personal devices carried user move different environments populated various platforms 
kind scenario raises need find way user deploy personal devices get connected exchange information platforms may surroundings 
considerations lead idea migrating interfaces different platforms 
user browsing net pda touch screen mobile phone keypad comfortable mouse keyboard stationary pc 
conversely user may entering private data stationary pc wish greater privacy afforded personal device 
interesting case user interacting multimedia application say pda browsing images videos 
power consumption reduced screen size device hard fully enjoy visualisation content 
appealing keep interacting pda control operations watch videos displayed big wall sized screen just pressing button 
short scenarios introduced exemplify need multi platform migration service allowing user interact application different devices 
main issues concerning kind service 
firstly diversity features platforms involved migration different screen size interaction facilities processing power supply application developed desktop unsuitable pda vice versa 
application migrate device needs intelligent engine order adapt interface different features target platform 
second issue concerns interaction continuity 
users want application migrate want restart application new device want continue interaction point left having re enter data go long series links get page visiting previous device 
main kinds information relevant performing migration static information referring device features runtime information refers state migrating application summarised history user interactions application including visited pages submitted data results previous data processing
