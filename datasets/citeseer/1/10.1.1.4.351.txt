risk strategy trading agent preferences determined limit price maximum buyer willing pay minimum seller accept 
preferences fed agent trading strategy determines responds market conditions bids asks 
strategy risk seeking trader tries achieve high profit correspondingly lower probability transacting risk averse trades lower profit higher probability transacting 
risk neutral strategy considers bid ask maximises expected profit

second layer represents adaptive behaviour trader updates risk factor triggered market event transaction occurs new bis ask submitted

component described turn 
bidding layer period trader information limit price 
buyer simply bids minimum limit price outstanding ask see equation maximise surplus 
similarly seller submits ask maximum cost price cjk outstanding bid see equation 
buyer seller agree transaction bid ask improvement outstanding bid ask respectively absolute value spread set minimum indivisible unit currency 
max cjk round min round constant determines decrease rate profit margin 
low implies faster rate convergence bids asks transaction price conversely high implies conservative bidding approach slow convergence 
buyer low limit price maintain bargaining power able bid long possible 
contrast buyer high valuation relative outstanding ask maximise profit exploring market exponentially reducing bid ask spread case behaviour equation 
outstanding bid ask higher lower buyer limit price seller cost price trader submit bid ask round 
transaction trader updates estimate ce price refines transaction 
initially set trader risk factor close adopting risk neutral attitude means risk averse risk seeking 
risk model uses ce price estimation risk factor calculate new target price

learning rules role risk model generate target price trader risk attitude defined risk factor 
target price equal estimated ce price implies trader 
trader adopts risk seeking attitude considers target price ce buyer ce price seller order obtain higher profit margin 
conversely risk averse attitude implies trader targets bids ask ce improves probability bid ask accepted decreases profit margin 
ce known priori decentralised environment need estimate ce price history transactions describe sub section 
model risk differently different types agents may react differently market conditions 
generally agents types intra marginal extra marginal 
buyer seller intra marginal limit price cost price higher lower ce price expected transact market 
contrast extra marginal buyer low valuation extra marginal seller high cost transact 
consider intra marginal trader 
identified constraints risk model satisfy trader different risk attitudes buyer completely risk averse targets bid limit price completely risk seeking targets bid 
risk function continuous pass specified values risk factor

detail intra marginal buyer seller model follows buyer seller max re cjk log max cjk consider case trader extra marginal 
case trader modifies risk function shown 
reflects fact extra marginal trader risk averse risk factor greater chance transacting profit 
note equations apply extra marginal trader replaced limit price 
equilibrium estimator moving average method estimating ce price history transactions 
choice objective analytical tool gives average value time frame spanning transaction 
sensitive price changes short time frame longer time span sensitive filters high frequency components signal frame 
moving averages commonly emphasize direction trend smooth price fluctuations trader 
assumption transaction prices converge equilibrium introduce notion 
risk extra marginal traders different recency moving average giving weight transaction prices 
doing emphasises convergence pattern history improving estimation
