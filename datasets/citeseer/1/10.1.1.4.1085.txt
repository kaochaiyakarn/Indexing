packet routing forwarding challenging task 
research shown position routing pbr performs vehicular movement scenarios especially highway environments 
pbr uses geographic position nodes decide direction data packet forwarded 
traditional pbr protocols gpsr face beacon messages node announces address geographic position neighbors radio broadcast :10.1.1.112.2772
node receives beacon message neighbor stores address position node neighbor table 
node forward packet uses table determine neighbor packet forwarded order progress final destination 
usually decision geometric heuristic selecting neighbor minimizing remaining distance destination greedy forwarding
