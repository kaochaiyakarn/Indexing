key issue drives study identification clustering wireless clients characteristics sessions 
specifically consider metrics session duration building path distance building path length longest cycle free subpath diameter pace 
client may paths exhibit different characteristics respect metrics 
goals determine important features identify sessions cluster clients characteristics 
apply statistical techniques including multidimensional clustering visualization detect patterns usage mobility 
research extends earlier study studies kotz balachandran tang baker balazinska castro focusing closely association mobility patterns individual clients entire population mobile clients finer time granularity 
monitor behavior wireless user respect association patterns carry user behavior analysis accurately
