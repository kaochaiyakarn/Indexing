informal evaluation ar game playing indicates people enjoy form visual presentation game play 
section presents issues possible areas investigation produce better ar gaming technology 
major concern safety games unsafe remove hazards 
major technology required method efficiently effectively model new game worlds 
overcame technology challenges games enjoyable 
thoughts aspects contribute pleasurable gaming experience 
describe gaming contexts ar may employed 
safety safety foremost concern ar outdoor setting 
hmd ar information displayed user may encounter information tunnelling operating ar application user may pay attention information hmd physical world 
may lead user dangerous situations walking front moving car stepping hole ground 
currently reasons second person walk alongside user operating game extended period time 
believe major ways tackle problem 
restrict user safe playing arena 
example play game cricket oval 
number possible dangerous elements 
field scrutinized possible loose footing conditions 
games restricted basically open field arenas 
second solution game require user focus physical world 
bringing elements physical world large small help users concentrate virtual physical time 
game developed users pay attention physical buildings occlude monsters game pieces 
stopped people walking walls users moving cars roads 
example poor tracking system drifted game pieces road building 
game pieces users step road 
method solve number problems design games lure people away dangerous situations 
interesting virtual objects placed away roads 
sense play forms games away situations fact remains steps outside ways person may hurt 
modelling tools high quality tools building graphical models outdoor ar games necessary 
constructing models typical desktop application 
recognized difficulty developing graphics model indoors viewing outside establish correct 
decisions colour schemes sizes positioning best determined outdoors 
authoring game quest puzzles monster attributes best determined desktop computer 
second problem modelling outdoor ar games physical world model game 
sizeable quantity buildings required user enter play setting defined 
game customised environment players 
example sized football fields 
customers need able easily configure game environment 
game lose mass market appeal 
implemented metro application capturing city models 
technique supports modelling relatively complex buildings large physical structures situation prefabricated graphical models representative community infrastructure city artefacts 
user performs tasks interactively walking outdoors assistance ar wearable computer 
modeller uses constructive solid geometry csg related techniques infinite planes technique allow user build complex shapes simpler primitives 
metro system combines csg modeller user interface hand 
hand supports interaction techniques pinch gloves vision hand tracking 
fun outdoor ar game 
appealing feature outdoor ar games user movement game reflects physical movement 
design games replicate feature people walk slowly compared game avatar movement desktop game 
second smaller feature person walk way back initial staring point football field order restart game 
desktop versions games users back start level 
games required redesign accommodate feature 
believe users want games laser tag style games users able physically move group users 
users want physical game hardware lightweight unobtrusive people pretend having real battle 
added feature ar games ability fight virtual monsters exist world 
implement shared version game wireless communication required allow computers distribute information users 
known problem wireless lan equipment short range supports limited number users unusable 
possible solution move global network gsm
