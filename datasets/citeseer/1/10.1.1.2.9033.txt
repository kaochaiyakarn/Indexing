basic ideas defeasible reasoning language defeasible reasoning defeasible theory knowledge base defeasible logic consists different kinds knowledge strict rules defeasible rules superiority relation 
fuller versions defeasible logic facts defeaters shows simulated ingredients 
strict rules rules classical sense premises facts 
example strict rule professors faculty members 
written formally professor faculty 
defeasible rules rules defeated contrary evidence 
example rule professors typically hold permanent positions written formally professor permanent 
idea know professor may conclude person professor inferior evidence suggesting contrary 
superiority relation rules define priorities rules rule may override rule 
rules labelled allow 
example defeasible rules professor permanent visiting permanent contradict conclusive decision visiting professor permanent appointment 
introduce superiority relation intended meaning strictly stronger conclude visiting professor permanent appointment 
relation assumed acyclic 
declared transitive certain domains need formal system properly 
worth noting defeasible logic priorities local sense rules considered competing complementary heads 
superiority relation resolve conflicts competing rules compare rules complementary heads information rules complementary heads may part superiority relation effect proof theory
