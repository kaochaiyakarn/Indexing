societies mind 
despite great popularity book society mind attempts implement theory 
difficulty minsky presents theory fragments variety levels mechanical aspects theory largely distributed text specially distinguished glossary 
support interested implementing societies mind section reviews specific mechanisms representations minsky describes 
examining society mind agents 
minsky sees mind vast diversity cognitive processes specialized perform type function expecting predicting repairing remembering revising debugging acting comparing generalizing simplifying ways thinking 
especially common uniform functions agent different type process distinct kinds purposes languages describing things ways representing knowledge methods producing inferences forth 
get handle diversity minsky adopts language neutral internal composition cognitive processes 
introduces term agent describe component cognitive process simple understand term agency describe societies agents performs functions complex single agent 
agencies seen unitary agents ignoring internal composition considering external effects 
minsky notes recycled old words agent agency english lacks standardized way distinguish viewing activity agent piece machinery single process seen outside analyzing behavior functions inside structure agency produces 
society mind mental activity ultimately reduces turning individual agents 
time agents society mind active combined activity constitutes total state mind 
may different activities going time different agencies minsky introduces term partial state mind describe activities subsets agents mind 
simplest agents 
minsky agents building blocks mind 
describes primitive agents larger agencies constructed 
lines 
lines common agent society mind theory 
purpose line simply turn particular set agents agents interconnections activating line cause cascade effects mind 
lines formed chunking net effects problem solving episode time system faces similar problem previous solution starting point experience deriving solution includes memories false starts unexpected discoveries curiously term agency seen little people society agents 
society mind total set agents mind 
push singh lessons previous experience aren captured final solution 
lines cause society mind enter particular remembered configuration agents formed useful society past 
lines simple powerful mechanism mind engaging relevant kinds problem solving strategies forms knowledge types goals memories particular experiences mental resources help system solve problem 

minsky uses lines somewhat different way basis structured computer model information represented processed society mind 
introduces general classes lines calls analogous data control lines design computer 
concerned representing aspects world concerned controlling representations processed manipulated 

invoke representations things produced learning experience 
minsky gives examples types including 
invoke partial states multiple agencies agency concerned representing different aspect thing 
example recognizing apple apple invokes certain properties color shape taste agencies mentally manufacture experience apple brings mind sensory aspects cost apple places apples kind situations eat apple forth 
support idea thing meaning best expressed terms single representation distributed way multiple representations 
provide global contextual signals agencies brain 
describe aspects situation subtle words determinate concepts specific smells colors shapes feelings 
refer aspects situation difficult attach particular thing particular object event diffuse indefinite 
minsky suggests organized ring closing networks great societies recognizer agents activity spreads bottom top directions engage context sensitive pattern matching processes recognizing objects parsing sentences producing plans reducing ambiguities 
kinds parsing recog minsky forthcoming book emotion machine lines elevated role selectors emotional states 
selector line turns set resources mind certain representations selecting prioritizing sets goals retrieving particular fragments knowledge invoking certain strategies knowledge aspects particular state 
examining society mind nition processes subject garden path phenomena forms getting stuck minsky suggests additional agents involved regulating ring closing process weed problems network activity 

control representations manipulated 
minsky gives examples types including 
signal different agencies perform uniform type cognitive operation 
example may cause set agencies save current state short term memory load different state cause training new long term line reproduce current state cause imagine consequences certain action 
control short term memory representations 
associated specific role larger situation event actor takes action location event occurs 
connect restricted types short term memories store specific types knowledge example places shapes paths 
may general purpose influential reaching agencies brain 
minsky calls connect great representations describe virtually 
may just great connections required implement 
sets linked assignments changes representation produce corresponding assignments changes related representations 
minsky introduces concept describe knowledge represented different ways related treated somewhat uniform manner 
example location connected location attached different representations spatial location terms egocentric body centered coordinate system terms external third person coordinate system 
coordinate multiple representations 
combine agents build larger agencies 
minsky gives examples society mind combine primitive agents larger agencies complex things 
examples concerned larger representational systems built simpler agents particular describes types frames built simple elements recognizer agents 
frames 
frames form knowledge representation concerned representing thing things properties relate certain emotion machine minsky uses term refer collection linked partial states multiple representations set analogous descriptions controlled 
push singh particular ways attached slots frame 
minsky describes simple frames may built sets control attachments slots frame 
bound frame invoked cause associated representations invoke partial descriptions aspects thing described 
frame arrays 
describe thing richly just frame collection frames frame describes thing particular perspective point view 
frame arrays collections frames slots common 
minsky gives example representing appearance cube multiple different viewpoints viewpoints described frame common parts sides cube linked different frames 
reason sharing slots frame description inadequate solving problem representing situation easy switch frames slots attached relevant information 
shared slots frame arrays ancestors 

central form knowledge representation society mind theory 
represent events entities involved related event 
may slots representing origin destination change states caused event motivation event goal intended achieve intention objects affected occurred tools objects involved producing change important aspects event 
ordinary life concerns relationship events various types representation central everyday thinking 
types frames 
addition minsky describes types frames including story frames represent structured collections related events picture frames represent spatial layout objects scenes 
presumably types frames required represent organize world cognitive processes 
agents solve problems 
minsky argues single method societies agents solve problems suggest ways build organize problem solving agencies 
difference engines 
mean solve problem 
solving problem regarded reducing eliminating important differences current state desired goal state 
minsky proposes simple machine called difference engine embodies problem solving strategy 
operate recognizing differences current state desired state acting reduce difference invoking lines turn suitable solution methods 
difference engine idea newell simon early examining society mind gps problem solver 
minsky gps idea central principle interpret minsky suggesting view mind society difference reducing machines populate mind level 
ultimately single mechanism building difference engines single way compare different representations 

method problem solving reasoning especially comes ordinary commonsense reasoning 
minsky proposes addition knowledge problem solving methods knowledge avoid common bugs pitfalls methods 
calls type knowledge negative expertise 
society mind describes knowledge embodied form censor suppressor agents 
suppress mental activity precedes unproductive dangerous actions suppress unproductive dangerous actions 
minsky suggests negative expertise form bulk know remain invisible knowledge directly manifest 
suggests intimate connection humor negative expertise laugh joke may learning particular type problem pitfall ordinary common sense reasoning 
minsky discusses ideas extensively 
brains brains 
types unproductive mental activity specific particular method looping occur problem solving method engages search 
minsky introduces notion brain job think outside world think world inside mind brain able notice kinds errors correct 
division mind levels reflection idea central minsky theories 
agents communicate 
society mind agents different internal representations interact knowing 
minsky recognized early difficulty trying formulate theory cognition assumed consistent meanings cognitive signaling agents symbols understand need body conventions 
want bypass need dispersed consistent symbol definitions 
fact minsky points simplicity agents challenging emotion machine minsky give levels separate names reactive deliberative reflective self reflective self conscious self ideals levels level concerned representing responding problems levels beneath 
push singh smaller languages harder translate 
meanings 
fewer things agent agent correspond things 
section mechanisms minsky proposes agent communication society mind designed considerations mind 
lines 
simplest method communication agent just arouse sets agents 
agent turn arouse agents think particular object event situation may turn cause agents think general context forth 
type communication necessary sender agent know express idea terms representations available recipient agent 
information stored intervening lines result successful past communications 
connection lines 
agents directly connected communicate connection lines buses bundles wires transmit signals agents attached bus 
wires thought simple agents initially meaningless time individual wires take local significance come acquire dependable repeatable meanings 
agents communicate connection lines connecting lines random subsets bus wires 
strategy random connection invented calvin allows relatively small bus simultaneously represent great independent symbols states low probability collision 
side agents observe connection lines recognize patterns signals wires 
just senders initially know wires mean recipients agents connect bus need guesses hypotheses come understand meanings 
internal language 
agencies need communicate complex structured descriptions things system linked frames minsky proposes elaborate communication mechanism modeled re duplication theory people communicate natural language 
agent wishes convey complex idea attempts re construct idea expressed representational system sequence frame retrieval instantiation operations 
operations associated grammar tactic produces words signals sent recipient agent 
inverse grammer tactics recipient agent perform analogous construction operations terms different representations recipient agent 
method communication requires communicating agents agree meanings words representation construction operations 

common method communication society mind active communication 
examining society mind agents find information need available need 
result 
described earlier produces particular state terms representation simultaneously update representations enter corresponding states 
communication happens sending explicit messages times different agencies separately looking property object event situation type thing unique perspective changes representation immediately reflected corresponding representations 
ambiguity 
communication mechanism important consideration agents communicate society mind precise communication may unnecessary fact may impossible different agents 
find hard express thoughts summarize mental states put ideas words 
tempting blame ambiguity words problem deeper 
thoughts ambiguous 
significance agency state depends affect states agencies 
illusion assume clear absolute distinction expressing thinking expressing active process involves simplifying mental state diffuse variable parts context 
tolerate ambiguity words competent coping ambiguity thoughts 
section methods communication doubt produce misunderstandings agreed convention meanings symbols meanings stable entities minsky argues state affairs really avoided find ways build societies agents tolerant degree vagueness ambiguity thoughts communications 
growth mental societies societies mind grow 
minsky suggests mental societies constructed time trajectory process differs person person 
offers potential mechanisms growth 

infant mind functional large scale agencies highly evolved agencies produce behaviors providing initial solutions problems locomotion obtaining food water staying warm defending predators forth 
initial fairly unskilled time performance may improve exploiting agencies develop 
push singh learning 
related notion idea complex behaviors need fully pre specified fully learned result mixture partial influences 
minsky suggests kinds abilities shared people language walking result learning learning develops just internal external constraints result guaranteed 
types learning 
minsky describes important forms learning accumulating reformulating 
accumulating simplest form learning simply remember example experience separate case 
amounts finding general description subsumes multiple examples 
forming analogy form bridge representations 
reformulation amounts acquiring fundamentally new knowledge se finding new ways describe existing knowledge 
learning attachment figures 
important type learning concerned question learn goals place 
form learning acquire specific representations processes needed achieve goal learn particular goal adopted prioritized relative goals 
minsky suggests learn goals interactions attachment figures special people lives parents respect 
praise attachment figures results goal learning opposed skill learning attachment solving problem choose seek problems choose avoid problems 
learning mental managers 
mind grows acquires increasingly sophisticated models environment builds increasingly sophisticated cognitive processes making models knowledge knowledge 
accumulate mental societies agents build mental managers regulate processes delegating controlling repairing selecting specific knowledge problem solving techniques 
idea led minsky coin papert principle crucial steps mental growth simply acquiring new skills acquiring new administrative ways knows 
section sorts managerial hierarchies conflict resolution strategy minsky calls principle non compromise 
agents disagree employing simple method averaging weighting mental managers conflict sign need reformulate problem bringing third agent different perspective see problem potential solution greater clarity
