commerce changed way companies distribute products services consumers 
traditional mortar companies continue growing segment economy creating commerce presence 
companies created reshaped image having entire operations strictly commerce 
commerce strategy benefits consumer 
research aim improving accessibility expanding benefits commerce shopping consumers aiding move personalized efficient marketplace 
success commerce resulted problems analogous earlier created growth popularity internet 
search engines early solution problem finding information spread different web sites 
similarly shopper sift information provided innumerable commerce sites 
task difficult type amount organization information provided commerce sites differs 
complicating matters customer goes unaware changes pricing availability revisits sites frequently 
number things shoppers currently looking product 
straightforward approach manually visit various commerce sites site shopper browses searches particular product interest 
simple approach drawbacks 
single site caters shopping needs increases user search time new product category 
getting acquainted new vendor interfaces slows user browsing hinders impulse shopping 
approach favor largest vendors due name branding turn reduces effectiveness market 
second approach increases degree automatization site provided alert services 
services allow shoppers sign receive price alerts notify shopper price product changes falls specified amount 
services require lengthy surveys filled time provide little personalization 
drawback approach weakening user privacy implies 
third proposed approach involves voluntary ratings reviews vendors products users compilation information 
previous approach recommendation systems reduce size marketplace introduce bias difficult obtain sufficient number ratings existing vendor control reliability sources 
fourth general approach automate generalize search process 
early shopping agents referred comparison shopping agents proposed solution find product best terms price important feature early different commerce sites 
shopping agent queries multiple sites behalf shopper gather pricing information products services 
comparison shopping agents marketplace biased favor commerce sites collaborate shopping agent 
addition biased marketplace shopper limited number commerce sites choose participating sites offer best prices 
propose new type shopping agent called intellishopper extends approaches providing user autonomy personalization privacy 
autonomy refers idea shopping agent provide best possible service remaining independent possible customers vendors 
autonomy vendors implies service remain unbiased performing wide searches opposed searching databases preferred vendors 
achieved progress making interfaces uniform improved methods interpreting potential hits 
autonomy customer means users relieved tedious task searching information needing adjust different commerce sites 
furthermore shopping agent proactively monitors vendor sites behalf user notifying new products potential interest 
personalization means shopping assistant strives learn user behaviors preferences observing actions shopping 
user considers items available commerce sites indirectly provides feedback clicking items 
agent internalize feedback infer user preferences apply learned knowledge initiative searches predicting user interested item user notified 
research addresses privacy shopper concealing identity behavior user variety ways 
note privacy provided conditional selectively revoked abuse suspected 
personalization privacy aspects proposed agent provide unbiased personalized marketplace user benefits respects 

background research area shopping agents dates back early years web

consider issue hiding geographical location user 
user typically ip address best hidden passing requests anonymizer hides origin request intellishopper agent contents request anonymizer servers 
typically implemented distributed control 
request may multiply encrypted message 
anonymizer server gets partially decrypted passed server accompanied set requests 
server takes list inputs permutes operates decryption similar cryptographic operations 
server operated list corresponding outputs forwarded intellishopper server 
replies passing message back user employing user created temporary alias address reply passed back privacy agent 
privacy rely servers performing task correctly revealing secret decryption permutation information 
fact sake efficiency anonymizing server performed early re commercially tested web access anonymizing system 
server anonymizer degenerate case server privacy agent 
server trusted users commercial relation merchants parties wishing determine identity shoppers 
require servers knowledge secret key decryption corresponding public key encrypt request require knowledge public key 
type useful ad hoc keys pre assigned servers anybody may act server 
users may different pseudonyms personae order hide identity agent parties 
persona refer pseudonym user employs particular type activity wishes separate de correlate activities 
case social security numbers supporting evidence clear particular pseudonym persona long time part user identity 
fact possibility link pseudonym real identity reasonable probability sufficient order association remain 
important users migrate pseudonyms time migration frequency depends degree privacy desired 
note precision search depends somewhat continuous user naming 
order balance requirements users may obtain descriptors label search behavior allowing submit new personae 
note descriptors detailed allow strong cross pseudonym correlations
