particular creating database schema involves steps 
search common patterns selecting entities relationships typically done conceptual entity relationship model 
naming choose particular names entities properties relationships structuring take conceptual model translate particular data model relational tables object xml hierarchies 
step aided tools significant manual 
furthermore step additional naming decisions table names disambiguating property names 
ir patterns processes written discovered large collection database structures

briefly discuss contents corpus kinds patterns mine 
contents corpus corpus include kind information related structured data may give cues meaning data 
particular includes 

various forms structures expressive corpus include relational object oriented database schema entity relationship diagrams xml dtds schemas possibly associated integrity constraints functional dependencies 
expressive corpus include terminologies knowledge representation language owl 

instance data include actual rows tables representative rows xml documents 
fact include data sets schema certain file formats 
elements schema model instance data model 
distinction schema instance data clear cut 

validated mappings previously constructed mappings different database structures provide significant clues entities represented differently disparate models 
mappings included corpus 

queries queries posed users applications provide important information certain data 
example database query performs join attributes different tables indicates columns modeling domain evident schema specifies data type 

meta data forms meta data accompany database structures 
range text descriptions meaning different fields statistics table cardinalities histograms set possible values column 
important emphasize corpus logically coherent universal database 
collection disparate uncoordinated structures 
expect structures corpus stored accessed tools model management ber provide set operators manipulating models data opposed data 
statistics corpus plethora possible analyses performed corpus order extract interesting patterns 
finding effective ones long term research challenge 
describe certain kinds statistics computed corpus 
classify apply individual words terms partial structures elements particular schemas 
word term statistics statistics associated individual words language noun verb phrases 
statistics indicate word different roles structured data 
statistics maintain different versions depending take consideration word stemming synonym tables inter language dictionaries combination 
statistics include 
term usage frequently term relation name attribute name data percentage uses percentage structures corpus 

occurring schema elements different uses term relation names attributes tend appear 
tend names related tables attribute names 
tend join predicates pairs tables 
clusters attribute names appear 
mutually exclusive uses attribute names 
learn occurrence terms composite names schema elements 

similar names uses term words tend similar statistical characteristics 
composite statistics statistics applied partial structures 
examples partial structures sets data instances relations associated attribute names relation data possibly missing values 
fact works hc kn attempts learn partial structures 
clearly need significantly limit number partial structures keep statistics techniques discovering partial structures occur frequently pg 
statistics certain partial structures estimate statistics related structures 
statistics schema elements word different structures different meanings 
may want characterize specific usages terms structures relate usage terms structures 
example mbc learn classifier relation attribute name corpus 
ddh meta strategy learning 
training data learning gleaned schema element belongs training data elements mapped validated mapping corpus 
intuitively classifier meant recognize particular usage term appears differently structure 
corpus schema matching describe application corpus approach schema matching 
sharing data multiple data sources applications problem arises time large enterprises settings coordination government agencies large scale science projects world wide web 
architectures sharing data data warehousing data integration systems len message passing systems web services peer data management systems hist kno bgk ak key problem semantic heterogeneity structures schemas data sources originally designed independently 
obtain meaningful interoperation needs semantic mapping schemas 
semantic mapping set expressions specify data database corresponds data database 
languages specifying semantic mappings developed understood see len hal surveys creation semantic mappings key bottleneck labor intensive error prone 
goal schema matching assist human relate domain models 
complete automation process goal significantly increase productivity human experts 
matching problem difficult requires understanding underlying semantics schemas matched 
schema instance data provides clues intended semantics suffice order relate different schema 
process generating semantic mapping traditionally divided phases 
phase finds match schemas 
match result set correspondences elements schemas stating elements related 
example correspondence may state buyer schema model corresponds customer 
second phase builds correspondences creating mapping expressions 
mapping expressions expressed queries rules enable translating data data source reformulating query data source query 
plethora techniques proposed schema matching see rb survey nm dr 
collectively techniques mirror heuristics human designer may follow 
example techniques considered exploiting relationships names elements schemas structural similarities similarities data values correlations values different attributes 
works schema matching combining multiple techniques principled fashion mbr ddh dr 
corpus matching schema matching facilitated detailed knowledge domain matching performed 
creating knowledge base hard furthermore result may brittle sense helps domain coverage provides single perspective domain 
approach corpus matching complements knowledge base relevant knowledge large corpus database schemas previously validated mappings 
types knowledge glean corpus 
learn different ways words terms database structures relation names attribute names data values 
second validated mappings show variations term usages correspond disparate structures 
corpus easy construct different kind activity building detailed comprehensive knowledge base 
require careful ontological design knowledge base careful control contents removing key bottlenecks design knowledge bases 
corpus offers multiple perspectives modeling particular domain including different levels coverage domain 
provide knowledge useful matching disparate schemas 
lsd system ddh investigated benefit learning previously validated mappings 
worked considered case multiple data sources mapped single mediated schema users pose queries 
lsd provided mediated schema set training matches data sources 
lsd matches learn models elements mediated schema 
single learning algorithm captures cues domain lsd multi strategy approach combined predictions learners 
lsd asked predict matches mediated schema set test schemas 
experiments ddh showed possible achieve high accuracy multi strategy learning additional accuracy obtained considering domain constraints simple form domain knowledge 
lsd achieved matching accuracy small medium sized schemas data sources web 
lsd extended consider simple taxonomies concepts 
mbc investigate benefit corpus schemas matches ability corpus predict mappings pair schemas previously seen 
lsd learn models elements corpus information available schema validated matches provided corpus 
schemas calculate element similarity vector corpus similar element element corpus 
roughly speaking similarity vectors elements similar predict matches results experiments show modest corpus schemas able achieve accuracy correct matches corpus previously known techniques overlap significant differences 
corpus finding matches predicted techniques 
uses corpus schema matching application motivated corpus approach believe corpus general tool applicable briefly describe applications 
creating querying structured data argued outset greatest impediments database knowledge base technology conceptual difficulty dealing structured data 
faced challenge creating tools facilitate creation querying structured data 
tool schema design advisor assists authoring structured data spirit auto complete feature 
user tool creates schema fragment data particular domain tool proposes extensions schema corpus 
user may choose schema list modify fit local context 
note time savings tool advantages possibly resulting better designs helping users conform certain standards applicable 
querying side corpus approach facilitate querying unfamiliar data 
specifically consider tool enables pose query terminology database 
tool corpus propose reformulations query formed schemas database hand 
tool may propose queries possibly example answers choose refine 
hm argue corpus form basis new class knowledge representation systems 
web search query answering class applications concerns various information finding tasks web intranet 
application query answering natural language query posed web search interface finding relevant pages search engine tries find answers query 
second related application focused crawling search engine particular topic tries find pages relevant crawling initial set pages 
applications presence additional domain knowledge shown argued useful 
cost constructing knowledge bases wide domain coverage prohibitive 
contrast corpus approach yield robust solution 
challenges initial revealed significant challenges building corpus tools 
briefly describe challenges provide exciting research opportunities 
creating corpus challenge course creating corpus interest 
naturally organizations quick freely share schemas 
fortunately publicly available schemas useful 
furthermore initial experiments shown significant advantages obtained learning relatively small number schemas 
subtle issue focus corpus closely domains schemas corpus need related domain corpus 
example concerned mapping disparate schemas purchase orders corpus include schemas domain 
schemas domains help detract effectiveness corpus methods 
ideally able collect large corpus schemas carefully controlling domains devise methods exploit relevant information corpus 
granularity corpus corpus include disparate schemas 
extreme view term schema separate concept try learn patterns usage 
approach quickly get hand 
need devise techniques cluster elements corpus larger concepts learn patterns clusters 
tuning corpus automatic methods analyze corpus doubt manual tuning corpus useful 
tuning forms removing useless schemas adding particularly useful mappings schemas corpus helping clustering terms corpus addition combining corpus manually constructed domain model raises interesting challenges 
challenges corpus tools enormous believe payoffs huge results profoundly impact create structured data
