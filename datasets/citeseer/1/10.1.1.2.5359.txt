semantic understanding media required major tasks addressed multimedia production traditional retrieval tasks finding relevant media items innovative tasks generating coherent sto set media items 
semantics implies context understanding technical social context required including information copyrights provenance able build tools aware semantics content context multimedia need semantics explicit 
making semantics explicit usually achieved metadata 
goal find te appropriate ways annotate audio visual information units metadata way humans machines handle information 
machine readable aspect importance aim provide tools support multimedia production process generate multimedia generations autonomously 
metadata multimedia production chain audio visual av media production business presentation scenario complex process 
metadata improve production process making information explicit implicit av content 
obvious approach incrementally store relevant metadata production process accessible tools involved process 
remainder section discuss requirements approach sketch impact production environments 
media metadata production requirements media production iterative organic process convenience traditionally divided stages concerned determining main ideas form core production scripting production main task acquisition media material shooting sound recording post production oriented editorial decisions reviewing material editing sound mixing presenting archiving 
emphasized different production stages highly interdependent 
especially step produce modify data larger scale produce modify metadata 
tool produce update scripts export notes rationale underlying certain script modifications 
shooting produce raw footage explicit descriptions activities set 
tools produce edited mixed material production schedules editing lists decision descriptions organizational information 
step changes metadata directly impact material produced stages dependencies explicit supported different tools involved 
type metadata important represents progression various alterations technical structural description level 
defines original context individual media items 
today type information lost production finished needs re engineered needed 
precisely problem traditional approaches metadata production 
primarily address product characterizing audio visual information conceptual keyword perceptual level objective measurements image sound processing pattern recognition 
retrospective approaches naturally important cognitive content context information describing intermediate stages production decisions taken 
advance dvds include extra meta material making 
productions high quality metadata economic asset 
cases production extra information remain unrealistic necessitate manual annotation expensive endeavor normally covered production archival budget 
need high level tool support integrated production environment hinder creative processes important media production 
note environment produced media item micro shot macro level complete business presentation may linear nature 
collection material including intermediate physical av data creative decisions media production process contextual information establish non linear complex semantic network 
important stress network just reflects purposes intentions words context particular production 
idea saving complete production process new consequent implementation digital environment remains difficult 
requires standardized representational structures reflect constant changes av material undergoes production dynamic semantic structures allow representation conceptual developments time 
addition deeper impact digital media redefine traditional forms media blur boundaries traditional production steps alter information flow producers consumers 
consequently introduce additional step production process comprises processes restructuring representing redistributing media 
scenario described section class example type production material produced different purpose different context 
outcome process extension existing semantic network provides additional production information describes different context existing material 
note piece metadata change role turn piece media needs described 
example imagine film theoretician demonstrate referential quality particular director 
original sequence referenced film link sequence acts referrer 
media item acts relation metadata typical examples demonstrated station scene de palma arrest scene gilliam brazil refer steps scene eisenstein 
summarizing discussion requirements media aware semantic network component media exists independently production sufficient linking mechanisms required establish context 
annotation production basically different sides coin media item play various roles data metadata depending context 
flexible description schemata need developed reflect roles 
single production annotations necessarily imperfect incomplete preliminary accompany document dynamic progress understanding concept 
usually opens questions aesthetics subjective interpretation 
semantic episodic technical representation structures able change grow required 
thing single inclusive content description 
metadata reused multiple productions needs expressive mechanisms encoding metadata accessible controlled way 
thing single inclusive content description 
generation semantic annotations best achieved media production process requires support activities associated production phases 
challenge address requirements environment integrates instantiation maintenance dynamic structures actual working process 
media production environments media aware semantic web expects great variety media constantly generated manipulated analyzed commented 
web emerge people provided tools support dynamic nature audio visual media variety data representations combinations 
time tools need integrate mainly environment current semantic web technology 
today media production mainly oriented time design production 
means important sources metadata lost production finished exemplified tools multimedia production director photoshop flash front page powerpoint 
tools proprietary data structures nearly impossible internal content representation structures outside application different purpose 
net result little intrinsic compatibility systems different providers poor support broader reuse media content 
face paradoxical situation possibilities assist creative development production processes media lack environments serve integrated information space distributed productions research restructuring software agents direct access navigation audience 
hand attempts research industry demonstrate extra semantics added automatically semi automatically audiovisual material production interfering established workflows 
advantage tools standardized xml description mechanisms follow paradigm intelligent tools rely existence supportive descriptional structures

general problems metadata general problems concepts metadata annotation discussed great detail literature useful briefly summarize establish basis ongoing investigation state art metadata audio visual media 
high quality metadata essential supporting multimedia applications including sketched business presentation scenario 
unfortunately multimedia metadata comes number significant problems apply metadata general 
costs obtaining high quality metadata expensive time consuming 
text analysis feature extraction obtain metadata descriptions low level features automatically applications depend higher level annotations require human labour 
human annotation important expensive crucial done right time organizations simple afford second round annotation turns round yield desired results 
subjectivity having humans annotations expensive time consuming results highly subjective 
tool support documents interpreted differently different human annotators resulting inconsistencies single document collection 
worse annotators specific view content context supposed 
annotations possibly years user context differ radically annotators imagine annotation time 
restrictiveness highly formalized metadata schemata may provide machines appropriate information perceived restrictive human annotators 
hand restrictive schemata free text fields yield results terminology subjectively extent hardly value processing machine 
longevity longevity problem electronic documents may worse annotations 
hard design annotation schemata applicable short long term sufficiently specific useful original domain sufficiently generic domains 
schemata require extreme flexibility tool support extensions modifications version tracking extends current state art 
standardization tools annotators tools user relatively high degree standardization needed provide required interoperability 
syntax level ensure tool parse formats produced semantic level sure tools shared concepts terms different parties refer 
practice semantic interoperability requires certain degree automatic inferencing 
minimum requirement tools need capable find different terms equivalent terms related subsumption relation 
privacy metadata provide privacy security sensitive information needs handled particular care 
examples include medical documents annotated personal information patient digital artwork annotated insurance value original artifacts 
despite general metadata problems number issues specific metadata multimedia context 
multimedia specific metadata problems granularity goal multimedia production provide interesting relevant information composition different audio visual information units 
problem audio visual unit provide limited amount information contains wealth meaning 
example single image shown isolation may provide identifiable semantics 
image sequence appear modulated semantics order created new levels meaning 
effect appears sequences shots scenes film process complex 
essential aspects audio visual production get relationship representational systems image space order time right relationships communicate significant part meaning 
making kinds relationships explicit metadata requires descriptions multiple levels go direct content description cover implicit connotations discourse relationships relations describing rhetorical argument 
see general computational semantic representation models audio visual data 
making diverse range implicit meaning explicit capturing metadata annotations non trivial challenge 
multimedia common attach metadata objects appear media stream object video 
metadata apply frame featuring object 
specification frames hard independent shot scene boundaries 
different units metadata may address different frame ranges requiring stratified approach 
specific frame identifying target object trivial 
audio visual interpretation specific subjectivity human annotators serious obstruction semantics non textual documents need interpreted 
basis problem rooted myriad cognitive cultural codes buried audio visual material source varying interpretations annotations individuals 
goal facilitate metadata generation allows establish different views audio visual material 
flow management lot high quality metadata produced different phases multimedia production process 
examples include scenarios scripts storyboards edit decision lists additionally semantic loaded low level features captured multimedia production process 
digital camera record continuous stream information camera settings zoom focus information lens shutter speed white balance wall clock time video signal 
unfortunately metadata longer available final version distributed user 
challenge lies controlling flow metadata addressing target metadata multimedia similar identification source target links time hypermedia seen open issue especially standardization point view 
entire production chain making relevant parts accessible people applications authorized 
media items new coherent story multimedia challenging text 
aim provide description alternating contexts context particular media item play different rhetoric role 
data quantity streaming sheer bulk digital multimedia content complete download material playback undesirable giving rise streaming content delivery 
similar arguments apply bulky multimedia metadata need delivered streaming fashion disrupting stream av content 
digital rights management multimedia complex production process digital rights management complex text 
parties directors producers scenario writers actors may exercise rights single media item 
problems need addressing vision media aware semantic web possible 
excessive nature discussion combines various problems argument scope 
focus article problems directly associated semantics non textual media 
scenario described earlier essential problem face supply means allow production maintenance high quality metadata 
quality metadata provides significant syntactic semantic semiotic aspects media content necessary establish new persuasive contexts required effective restructuring representing re existing content
