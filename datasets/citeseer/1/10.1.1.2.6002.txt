starting point cient markets hypothesis emh powerful idea traced back paul samuelson contribution neatly summarized title article proof properly anticipated prices fluctuate randomly 
informationally cient market price changes properly anticipated fully incorporate expectations information market participants 
concept informational ciency counter intuitive seemingly contradictory avor cient market random sequence price changes generated market cient market price changes completely random unpredictable 
course accident nature direct outcome active participants attempting pro information 
unable curtail greed army investors smallest informational advantages disposal doing incorporate information market prices quickly eliminate pro opportunities gave rise actions 
occurs instantaneously idealized world frictionless markets costless trading prices fully re ect available information pro ts garnered information trading pro ts captured 
central tenets modern nancial economics necessity trade risk expected return 
security expected price change positive may just reward needed attract investors hold asset bear corresponding risks 
investor su avoid holding security returns 
prices need perfectly random markets operating ciently rationally 
statistical studies clear prices fact completely random see example lo mackinlay 
economists disagree represents violation cient markets 
similarly sustained pro ts investment companies certain high pro le portfolio managers challenge tions market rationality ciency 
just lucky 
merely receiving appropriate compensation risk 
markets simply ine cient 
questions proved di remain controversial 
reasons state airs fact emh posed empirically refutable hypothesis 
operational specify additional structure investors preferences information structure emh test auxiliary hypotheses rejection joint hypothesis tells little aspect joint hypothesis inconsistent data 
new statistical tests designed distinguish doubt require auxiliary hypotheses turn may questioned 
hypothesis investors fully rational agents instantaneously correctly process available information clearly unrealistic rationality di cult de ne human behavior unpredictable information di cult interpret technology institutions change constantly signi cant frictional costs gathering processing information transacting 
take complexities real world account 
new direction treat emh idealization provides useful point 
example ask relative ciency markets respect futures vs spot markets auction vs dealer markets advantages concept relative ciency opposed notion absolute ciency easy spot way analogy concept ciency physics 
heat engines ciency rating fraction available energy convert useful 
refrigerator ciency considered quite buyer prefer ciency

point view extend de nition cient markets consistent pro ts possible acquire competitive advantage 
motivation apparent applying classical version emh non nancial context biotechnology rm attempting develop vaccine aids virus 
market biotechnology cient classical emh sense vaccine developed done 
clearly absurd ignores challenges lags research development biotechnology 
pharmaceutical succeed developing vaccine pro ts earned measured billions dollars considered excess pro ts simply appropriate economic reward competence innovation 
financial markets di erent principle degree
