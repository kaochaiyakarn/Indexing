disconnection 
challenged networks disconnection may common connection 
generally speaking disconnection may broadly categorized due fault 
faults studied extensively conventional networks considered 
non faulty disconnections arise frequently wireless environments primarily sources motion low duty cycle system operation 
disconnection due motion may highly predictable satellite passes busses act data routers opportunistic nodes arrive communication range due random walk may arise due motion nodes routers object signal obscures communication 
disconnection due low duty cycle operation common low capability devices sensor networks predictable 
exceptional conditions requiring immediate attention event responses perturb periodic low duty cycle operation unpredictable times 
long queuing times 
multi hop paths conventional packet networks statistical multiplexing queuing time dominates transmission propagation delays 
queuing time rarely exceeds second typically packets discarded routers hop neighbors instantaneously reachable
