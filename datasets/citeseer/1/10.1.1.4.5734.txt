discussion just person tries unnecessarily interrupt application unnecessarily interrupt user engaged task 
interrupting user behavior demonstrates disruptive effect user task performance emotional state 
primary implication need build system attention manager manages user attention applications competing 
attention manager observe predict opportune moment gaining user attention notify waiting application 
opportune moment defined period low memory load occurring user task sequence task boundary delayed system response 
delaying interaction user opportune moment arises application bypasses mitigates disruptive effects interruption 
building system poses new research challenges infeasible 
example horvitz built system learned temporal patterns user interacting email system 
learned behavior predict user finish reading current email message delayed agent interaction user time passed 
addition implementing attention manager extend experiment examine effects multiple task interruptions frequency user task performance emotional state 
audio display interruption user task performance emotional state

key findings user performs slower interrupted task non interrupted task ii level annoyance experienced user depends category primary task performed time peripheral task displayed iii user experiences greater increase anxiety peripheral task interrupts primary task iv user perceives interrupted task difficult complete non interrupted task 
implication results need build systems attention manager help manage user attention competing applications mitigating effects unnecessarily interrupting user
