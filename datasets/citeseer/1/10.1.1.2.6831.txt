believe ilp applied successfully information extraction biomedical domains link learning tasks 
ilp offers advantages straight forward way incorporate domain knowledge expert advice produce logical clauses suitable analysis revision humans improve performance 
aleph mature ilp system learn order clauses 
standard approach ilp learn clauses sequentially positive examples covered clause creating theory 
individual theory produce value precision recall uses standard logical approach disjunction combine clauses theory 
useful evaluation create curve illustrates trade measurements 
way create recall precision curve theory containing clauses require clauses satisfied 
varying obtain variety points recall precision curve 
ilp systems traditionally designed produce recall precision curves specially designed algorithms better simply counting number clauses satisfied example 
address goal efficiently producing recall precision curves ilp propose gleaner algorithm 
gleaner randomized search method collects clauses broad spectrum points recall dimension recall precision curves employs clauses thresholding method combine selected clauses 
compare gleaner ensembles standard aleph theories 
find gleaner produces comparable results fraction training time needed aleph ensembles 
smaller theories reduce classification time important consideration working large domains
