web browser support cookies persistent example obscuring information flow 
browsers default indicate site sets cookie information disclosed

concerning action pitfalls pitfalls primarily involve user actions involving system 
pitfalls encode recognition fine grained control privacy emerges nuanced manipulation coarse grained controls

pitfall emphasizing configuration action designs require excessive configuration create maintain privacy 
enable users manage privacy natural consequence primary actions involving system 
palen dourish write setting explicit parameters requiring people live simply information technology requires fine shifting line privacy publicity exists dependent social context intention fine grained coordination action disclosure action 
configuration universal ui design pattern systems fall pitfall configuration 
configured privacy breaks reasons 
real settings users manage privacy intuitively course primary actions spell privacy needs auxiliary focused effort 
configuration imposes awkward requirement users 
second act configuring preferences easily contexts preferences apply 
users challenged predict needs hypothetical circumstances forget preferences time 
predict wrongly remember incorrectly configured preferences differ situ needs creating conditions invasion privacy 
evidence evaluating faces 
third users tend avoid configuring systems anyway default settings prevail

evidence falling pitfall 
systems emphasize explicit configuration privacy including experimental online identity managers filesharing software web browsers email encryption software faces prototype 
evidence avoiding pitfall 
successful solutions involve measure configuration tend embed actions necessary system 
web sites com tribe net allow users regulate information flow modifying social networks process embedded applications 
georgia tech board lets users reveal conceal presence workspace device 
purpose convey information intuitively information falsely signaling status 
ignoring moral implications example involves camera surveillance 
aware camera presence tends intuitively adjust behavior wants perceived 
gupta propose smart card hand receptionist limited access calendar schedule appointment hand back right 
setting permissions 
suggest extending scheduling systems automatically meeting partners access user location minutes leading meeting infer arrival time 
action scheduling meeting implies limited approval location disclosure 
pitfall lacking coarse grained control designs fail provide obvious top level mechanism halting resuming disclosure personal information 
users accustomed turning thing want operation 
turning information flow intuitive action supports privacy 
binary control simple linear control may appropriate cases cf audio devices mute volume controls 
ubicomp systems convey location context incorporate precision dial hide button users adjust precision context disclosed decidedly halt disclosure 
general case users remarkably adept coarse grained controls yield nuanced results driving car 
coarse grained controls tend reflect state providing direct feedback freeing user having remember set preference properly 
helps users accommodate controls opt ways designer may intended 
examples specific privacy include setting door covering repositioning cameras turning phone invisible mode navigating privacy related options removing locator badge 
fine grained controls may unavoidable flexibility fine grained controls intended provide neglected users see pitfall 
flexibility control privacy comes system user nuanced coarse grained controls 
evidence falling pitfall 
commerce web sites recommend shoppers items purchased shoppers similar shopping histories 
useful service times shopper want item hand included profile effectively wants shop anonymously current session

similarly web browsers bury privacy controls layers configuration panels

evidence avoiding pitfall 
systems expose simple obvious ways halting resuming disclosure include easily coverable cameras mobile phone power buttons chat systems invisible modes board faces prototype button handheld application overrides current settings 
pitfall inhibiting social nuance designs inhibit existing social practices 
people accustomed creating maintaining privacy range established nuanced practices 
examples include plausible deniability observer determine lack disclosure intentional disclosing ambiguous information 
designs inhibit nuanced disclosure practices constrain users managing privacy intuitively action 
technical systems involving multiple users notoriously awkward supporting social nuance privacy highly nuanced social activity 
leaves designers privacy affecting systems dilemma 
compromise systems incapable actively supporting nuance avoid constraining 
appropriate degree designs allow users information fear plausible deniability disclose ambiguous information imprecise location 
subtle ways people fine tune privacy 
designs adapt new practices users develop 
key imposing excessive rigidity users behavior 
system supports flexible usage practices allows users exploit subtleties hopefully positive ways designer may intended 
process empowers users system manipulate create subtle shades privacy social behavior requires 
evidence falling pitfall 
researchers envision context aware mobile phones inform caller user activity help explain call answered 
prohibit users exploiting plausible deniability 
value keeping caller ignorant reason answering 
location tracking systems described constrain users ability incorporate ambiguity location disclosures 
users convey single precision location times 
evidence avoiding pitfall 
mobile phones push phones instant messaging users exploit plausible deniability responding having explain 
privacy web common concern basic function html allows users practice ambiguous disclosure
