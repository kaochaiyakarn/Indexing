describe multi agent system called aims enabling organised group people share results information searching world wide web 
users normally save relevant sites private collections bookmarks 
goal proposed system enable users share bookmarks implicit secure effective way 
implicit mean users required spend extra effort order system 
secure sharing refers capacity user control knows bookmark collections 
effectiveness ensured recommending users relevant bookmarks computed applying distributed collaborative filtering algorithm 
recommended bookmarks automatically inserted appropriate bookmark folder user local collection 
accessing folder user evaluate accept reject provided recommendations 
system multi agent system user associated assistant agent called wing agent 
wing agent observes user behaviour managing bookmark collection 
learns user classifies bookmarks 
hybrid neural case reasoning supervised classifier purpose 
wing agents exchange bookmarks defined collaboration protocol protects associated users privacy 
keywords collaborative information agents bookmark hybrid neural cbr classification 
intelligent agents browse index sites world wide web web humans 
consequently effective way locate relevant information web locate people know find searched information 
users usually store addresses relevant web sites bookmark directory 
web browsers available today provide users facility 
typically bookmark record holds information site address url site title title indexed page data bookmark creation date visit date description indexed page 
bookmark set personal web space helps user land marking huge information space composed currently available web pages 
major reason popularity bookmarks ease 
browsers simple click save currently visited web page list bookmarks 
simple click saved bookmark takes user directly required site 
order enhance access time saved bookmarks existing bookmarking tools allow users organise collections hierarchy folders 
may effectively enhance access time introduces new problems users continually trade cost organising bookmarks remembering bookmark folder versus cost having deal set bookmarks 
finding appropriate folder bookmark easy task 
bookmark may fit folder 
bookmark may require creating new folder splitting existing ones 
currently saving bookmark folder easily supported current tools creation bookmark 
assumption users organise bookmarks hierarchy folders 
user bookmark collection valuable information source users 
bookmarks valuable main reasons 
bookmarks results tedious hard information searching process 
users access bookmark collections spare required information searching effort 
lastly bookmarks explicitly intentionally added user give precise evidence information interests user 
applying collaborative filtering algorithm communities users share interests identified 
help establish alternative information searching tools community centred 
number academic commercial systems tackled problem building collaborative shared bookmark repositories 
systems www com www com allow users save bookmarks remote server 
users select wish bookmarks public 
system bookmark pool sharable searchable group users 
gab system automatically merge different user bookmark lists single seamless hierarchy 
rapp provides users personalised help bookmark classification group bookmark recommendation service 
systems allow build identify communities interest analysing user bookmark collections 
communities manually defined pharos semi automatically computationally 
amazingly existing collaborative bookmarking tools ignore major lessons learned decade computer supported collaborative cscw :10.1.1.26.154
outline original collaborative bookmarking system called collaborative web indexing enables organised group users share bookmarks implicit secure effective way 
implicit mean users required extra sharing bookmarks 
additional define access rights repositories 
role access control service provided order ease task 
secure sharing refers capacity user control knows bookmark collections 
effectiveness ensured recommending users relevant bookmarks computed applying distributed collaborative filtering algorithm 
proposed system implemented multi agent system 
user associated learning assistant agent called wing agent web indexing 
wing agent observes user behaviour learns user classified bookmarks 
wing interacts peer agents order identify communities interests 
community centred local bookmark folder 
identified communities recommend user new bookmarks interest 
user access bookmark folder recommended items relative folder displayed 
user accept reject delivered recommendations 
recommendation evaluation appropriate context intrusive 
wing agents apply different interaction protocols order share knowledge compute recommendations 
discuss basic interaction protocol allow agents exchange raw date bookmark folders reminder organised follows

addition provides wings description users organisation hierarchy see section 
user manages hierarchy bookmarks just single user settings 
users required set access rules define personal bookmarks share 
easy access control service provided purpose see section 
wing agent observes associated user behaviour order learn user organises bookmarks 
goal wing agent implements hybrid incremental supervised neural cbr case reasoning classifier see section 
classifier learns user organisation policy positive negative examples 
user set positive examples composed bookmarks explicitly added user folder bookmarks recommended system accepted user 
negative examples bookmarks deleted moved folder rejected user recommended system 
roughly bookmark recommendations computed follows 
wing agent asks peer agents feed new bookmarks 
wing receives request wing computes view repository 
agent view composed set bookmark folders bookmarks agent read access right 
agent sends back bookmark folders constitute view repository 
received folder uses classifier switched classification mode order classify bookmarks contained majority bookmarks classified local folder fl recommends add bookmarks contained fl 
user consult bookmark folder fl confirm reject agent proposition 
depending user decision confirm reject recommended bookmarks treated positive negative examples
