learning extraction rules wrapper piece software enables semistructured web source queried database 
sources explicit structure schema implicit underlying structure example consider documents 
text sources email messages structure heading exploited extract date sender addressee title body messages 
sources online catalogs regular structure exploited extract data automatically 
critical problems building wrapper defining set extraction rules precisely define locate information page 
item extracted page needs extraction rule locate item 
framework document consists sequence tokens words numbers html tags equivalent finding tokens item 
hard part problem constructing set extraction rules pages source 
key idea underlying extraction rules landmarks groups consecutive tokens enable wrapper locate start item page 
example consider restaurant descriptions ande 
order identify address rule sample restaurant documents guide 
cuisine address pico st phone 
cuisine thai address oak blvd phone 
cuisine address main st phone 
cuisine pizza address adams blvd phone 
address sample restaurant documents 
meaning start document skip token find landmark consisting word address ignore find landmark 
called start rule identifies address 
write similar rule finds address sake simplicity restrict discussion start rules 
note means way address 
instance rules address cuisine address cuisine capitalized address start rules 
uses token landmark immediately precedes address ande relies token landmarks 
defined token landmark uses wildcard capitalized placeholder capitalized alphabetic string examples useful wildcards number 
deal variations format documents extraction rules allow disjunctions 
example assume addresses mile location appear bold see ones displayed italic ande 
extract names disjunctive start rule address address disjunctive rules ordered lists individual disjuncts decision lists 
applying disjunctive rule straightforward process wrapper successively applies disjunct list finds matches 
simplified examples nondisjunctive rule address real world sources wrapped disjuncts 
developed stalker hierarchical wrapper induction algorithm learns extraction rules examples labeled user 
graphical user interface allows user mark pages site system generates set extraction rules accurately extract required information 
approach uses greedy covering inductive learning algorithm incrementally builds extraction rules examples 
contrast approaches key feature stalker able efficiently generate extraction rules small number examples rarely requires examples cases examples sufficient 
ability generalize small number examples fold explanation 
cases pages source generated fixed template may variations 
stalker tries learn landmarks part template follows templates little variations handful examples usually sufficient induce reliable landmarks 
second stalker exploits hierarchical structure source constrain learning problem 
precisely schema data extracted automatically decompose difficult problem extract items interest series simpler ones 
instance complex rule extracts restaurant names addresses phone numbers page take hierarchical approach 
apply rule extracts list restaurants rule break list tuples correspond individual restaurants tuple extract name address phone number corresponding restaurant 
hierarchical approach advantage able extract data pages contain complicated formatting layouts lists embedded lists previous approaches handle see details 
stalker sequential covering algorithm training examples tries learn minimal number perfect disjuncts cover examples 
definition perfect disjunct rule covers training example example rule matches produces correct result 
stalker creates initial set candidate rules repeatedly applies steps generates perfect disjunct select promising candidate refine candidate add resulting refinements stalker obtains perfect disjunct removes examples correct process repeated training examples 
stalker uses types refinements landmark refinements topology refinements 
rule specific adding token existing landmarks adds new token landmark rule 
instance assume examples want learn start rule address 
stalker proceeds follows 
selects example guide search 
second generates set initial candidates rules consist single token landmark landmarks chosen match token immediately precedes address guiding example 
case initial candidates token appears ine match examples 
hand matches examples matches early stops soon encounters html tag happens examples address 
better generalization potential stalker selects refinements 
refining stalker creates new candidates shown 
obtained landmark refinements token added landmark rules created topology refinements new landmark added 
works correctly examples stalker stops learning process returns 
punctuation address stalker able successfully wrap information sources wrapped existing approaches see details 
empirical evaluation sources proposed stalker learn extraction rules 
learned perfect rules accurate rules accuracy 
words learned rules accurate identifying highly informative examples stalker significantly better hard tasks ones failed learn perfect rules examples system provided carefully selected examples 
specifically informative examples illustrate exceptional cases 
unrealistic assume user willing skills browse large number documents order identify sufficient set examples learn perfect extraction rules 
general problem existing tools address regardless machine learning 
solve problem developed active learning approach analyzes set unlabeled examples automatically select examples user label 
approach called testing exploits fact multiple ways extracting information 
case wrapper learning system learn different types rules forward backward rules 
rules forward rules start document go 
contrast backward rule starts page goes 
example find addresses backward rules phone number phone number main idea testing straightforward user labels examples system learns forward backward rule 
runs rules set unlabeled pages 
rules disagree example system considers example user label 
intuition approach rules accurate page identify token address 
furthermore rules learned different sets tokens sequences tokens precede follow address respectively highly exact mistakes 
rules disagree wrong asking user label particular example obtain highly informative training example 
testing possible generate accurate extraction rules small number labeled examples 
illustrate testing works consider examples 
restaurants city located mile radius location follows documents source similar toe ande addresses shown italic just examples similar addresses shown bold 
consequently address bold small randomly chosen initial training set 
assume initial training set consists ofe ande ande labeled 
examples learn rules fwd address phone number rules correctly identify address restaurants mile away consequently agree 
hand fwd works incorrectly examples stops phone number 
correct rules disagree example user asked label
