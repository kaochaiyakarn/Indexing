discussion analyzing experimental data derive general results effect site structure lack effect site size causes node memorability errors subjective site size ranking 
site structure significantly affected user navigation 
strongly hierarchical sites generated activity weakly hierarchical ones measured accesses percentage visited virtual landmarks 
increased activity probably compensates limited horizontal paths strong hierarchy require extra steps inter branch navigation 
numerous structural landmarks weakly hierarchical sites increase memorability nodes 
site structure site size affected experimental measures significantly 
learning theory suggest memorable judged important nodes visited 
node level better predicts judged importance memorability connectivity status structural landmark 
experimental subjects started browsing root nodes result accords catledge pitkow users tend travel links starting position :10.1.1.25.8958
accordingly node level better predictor status virtual landmark status structural landmark 
weakly hierarchical sites algorithm identify structural landmarks generally finds low levels connectivity greater 
strongly hierarchical sites connectivity lesser procedure tends find structural landmarks 
appears algorithm mukherjea foley may effective finding behavioral landmarks common web site structures 
surprisingly web site structure affect significantly subjective size ranking 
note weakly hierarchical sites appear larger users largest experimental site strongly hierarchical judged smaller smallest experimental site weakly hierarchical account differences structure 
weakly hierarchical site speculate greater number navigational options generates sense extent range converse true strongly hierarchical sites 
web site designers result influence user perceptions 
large site employ strong hierarchy example small manageable 
small site weak hierarchy contrast large exciting 
general experimental results suggest strongly hierarchical sites greater usability 
exhibit accesses greater percentage visits greater memorability perceived smaller size correspondence user mental models 
unclear strongly hierarchical sites reflect organized thorough designers sites match innate human perceptual cognitive styles 
strongly hierarchical sketch maps encourage explanation parunak suggestion simpler hypermedia topologies easier navigate
