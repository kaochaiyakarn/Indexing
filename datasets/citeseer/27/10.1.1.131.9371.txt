background today internet composed distinct networks operated independent network providers referred internet service providers isps 
provider interested maximizing utility objectives providers necessarily aligned global performance objective 
relationships providers may classified categories transit peer 
transit relationship traffic originating provider pays third party transit provider carry traffic destined nodes outside originator local network 
hand peering relationship providers agree accept carry traffic 
focus primarily peering relationships 
peering arrangement pair providers agree install bi directional links multiple peering points accept traffic 
today internet peering relationships bill keep due ease implementation
