approaches problem 
key methods 
multi press input method multi press method currently main text input method mobile phones 
approach user presses key times specify input character 
example number key pressed character twice times 
multi press approach brings problem segmentation 
character placed key previously entered character word system determine new key press belongs previous character represents new character 
mechanism required specify start new character 
main solutions
