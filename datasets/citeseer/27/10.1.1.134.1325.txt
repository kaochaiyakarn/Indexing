methodology 
latent semantic analysis design research latent semantic analysis lsa landauer text analysis method characterizes semantic similarity words texts high dimensional semantic space 
mathematical foundation lsa lies singular value decomposition svd matrix approximation method reducing dimensions matrix significant vectors 
principal advantage lsa computational linguistics techniques lexical chain analysis anaphora resolution lsa examination context individual word meaning 
computational linguistics tools degrade performance data set noisy semantic understanding insufficient 
examining context semantics removes obfuscation created noise oral written communication scales deal large corpora 
lsa applied wide range problems full text information retrieval foltz assessing learning landauer shapiro mcnamara analysing cognitive processes underlying communication landauer assessing outcome design teams dong
