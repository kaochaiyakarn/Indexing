conflicts norms common problem open virtual organisations dealt 
norm governed agents populate vo remain operational able resolve conflicts 
discuss norm governed agents noa architecture identify conflicts noa model norm conflicts inform re negotiation contracts norms 
formation short term coalitions virtual organisations agents negotiate agree roles coalition obligations social constraints role 
virtual organisations situated changing world may need adapt changes 
dynamic nature organisations taken account design agents recruited organisational structures 
agents able process norms contracts define determine organisational structures actions interactions agents roles 
agents norm governed able take obligations prohibitions permissions account arise role 
adopting set norms agent finds specific social position 
due dynamic nature coalitions position change agent may adopt additional norms revise existing ones 
change lead conflicts agent may suddenly forbidden perform action may essential fulfil obligations 
example science researchers utilise agents find appropriate services performance scientific tasks 
service providers may employ agents answer requests 
execution research task example analysis data tool implemented grid service take place context coalition agents 
coalition agreement contract details transaction obligations participants prohibitions constrain actions agents 
example specific grid service may demand case client data analysed publicly available repository 
common complication scenario may fact research agent possibly uses grid service order fulfil contract industrial partner may wish data disclosed 
agent conflict resolved 
noa model norm governed agency specifically designed deal problems 
noa takes inspirations classical bdi models certain unique characteristics university aberdeen uk email sleeman csd ac uk norms class entities influence practical reasoning agent specific form deliberation called informed deliberation enables agents efficiently identify resolve norm conflicts 
agent noa model analyse fulfil obligations norm consistent way options actions obligation allowed agent forced violate norms wants fulfil obligation 
noa agents filter options action norm inconsistent 
deliberation process agent informed consistency situation obligation 
norm informed deliberation noa agent norm autonomous agent decide honour norms act 
agent perform actions norm consistent manner conflicts set norms agent able create complete partitioning options actions terms consistency 
important aspect noa model agents robust potential threat norm conflicts 
allowing conflicts place practical benefits engineering multi agent systems exceptional situations anticipated advance agents endowed deal 
fact argue possible ensure agent conflict free simple scenarios 
noa introduces mechanisms detecting classifying conflicts proposes conflict resolution strategies agent employ disambiguate normative position decide fulfil obligations 
addresses critical issue occurrence norm conflicts agents remain operative face conflicts 
conflict resolved agents involved 
set conflict resolution strategies proposed 
give re negotiation parts contract consideration 
specifically interested guide agents negotiation obligations prohibitions refined removed additional permissions ease conflict situation help agent remain operational 
usage scenario specific scenario illustrate importance normative approach grid services 
scenario research facility commits achieve specific research goals 
commitment specified formally form contract define rights contracting partners 
scenario assume contract established research facility includes obligation researchers deliver results specific analysis set data 
assume agreement describes prohibition researchers disclose data obligation observe confidentiality 
order fulfil obligation services grid execute scientific 
assume different service providers operating grid non profit organisation provides required service free requires user data available public commercial organisation provides required service obligation disclose data service expensive assume fee commercial service covered budget research organisation contract industrial partner allow spend money extra costs 
research organisation compelled free service 
introduces conflict free service requires data disclosed 
scenario demonstrates grid services requires agreements service providers clients agreements contracts introduce obligations rights contracting partners 
norm conflicts noa model architecture norm governed practical reasoning agents 
development model specific attention fact agents may confronted conflicting norms open environments 
conflict normally render agent unable act 
noa includes model informed deliberation provides agent information classes norm conflicts proposes conflict resolution strategies 
guarantees noa agents remain operational face conflicts 
noa model conflict detection classification resolution strongly influenced characteristics noa architecture noa agents operate reactive planning mechanism classic implementations bdi architecture capabilities noa agent provided set prespecified plans 
noa plans adapted specific needs norm governed practical reasoning agents able reason normative consequences possible actions 
noa plans contain explicit effect specifications describe state affairs occur due execution plan noa agents distinguish achievement goals performance actions obligation may require agent achieve goal agent select plan achieves goal effects obligation directly demands specific action specific plan exist agent capability fulfil obligation obligations motivator noa agent act achieve specific goal perform action 
conflict norms agent currently holds example agent time allowed forbidden perform specific action clear agent act 
order manage conflict situations noa agent able detect classify order resolve 
norm specification noa noa norm specification language provides constructs specify obligations permissions prohibitions 
examples simple blocks world scenario shows obligation forms achieve specific state affairs perform action obligation achieve prohibition perform shift example illustrates norm specification contains socalled activity specification determines achievement goal performance action 
example prohibition forbids specific state affairs achieved blocks world obligation determines specific shift operation performed 
case obligation demands action outcome forbidden prohibition norms conflict 
assumes agent holds plan shift provides capability fulfilling obligation 
specify general norms allow address range activities norm specification contain variables 
accordingly prohibition prohibition perform shift specifies agent prohibited shifting block block block 
general specification covers prohibition
