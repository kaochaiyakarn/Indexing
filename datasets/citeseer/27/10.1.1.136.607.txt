automatic speech recognition asr technology rapidly coming research laboratories everyday 
decades hard effort task advances search algorithms commonly available computing power rapidly making asr practical 
perfect asr system quickly transcribe spoken audio documents ideal solution audio indexing retrieval tasks speech 
system essentially reduce audio retrieval problem straightforward text retrieval problem described 
novel circle describes speech recognition research era soviet labor camp 
speech recognition practically asr systems hidden markov models hmms 
hidden markov model statistical representation speech event word model parameters typically trained large corpus labeled speech data 
trained set hmms exists efficient algorithm finding model sequence recognized words unknown speech data 
approach proved successful recognition systems keyword spotting systems location words phrases desired 
typically done training hmms desired keywords filler model attempts match keyword 
systems accurate computationally far expensive large vocabulary recognition system flexible handle unconstrained real world speech 
large vocabulary recognition systems contrast typically sub word approach building explicit hmm tens thousands words vocabulary sub word models typically phonetically 
phonetic dictionary appropriate sub word models concatenated form word model 
example word right constructed concatenating sub word models phones ay 
addition large vocabulary system requires statistical language model defines word combinations 
example english word bigram far bigram 
language model constrain recognizer word combinations correct 
useful language models trained example text typically millions words similar domain may practical certain domains news large corpora newspaper text available conversational speech 
particular advantage asr audio information retrieval dictation voice command tasks desired audio asr performed line real time 
disadvantage orders magnitude data recognize asr system sufficiently fast dictation may far slow hours audio search time 
primary drawback asr systems limited accuracy 
best continuous speech recognition systems achieve better word accuracy carefully recorded limited domain tasks wall street journal corpus similar systems achieve little better word accuracy real world tasks telephone conversations news broadcasts 
word accuracy rates appear bad results asr transcription surprisingly helpful information retrieval 
reason follows word error rate chance recognizer word word query desired document lower assuming relevant documents keyword occurrences
