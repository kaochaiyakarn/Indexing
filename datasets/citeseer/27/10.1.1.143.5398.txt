differences internet telephony internet telephony differs number respects terms architecture protocols 
differences affect design telephony services 
ip telephony relies paradigm delivery services 
signaling protocols systems involved call network routers treat signaling packets data ignoring semantics implied 
note ip telephony signaling routers effectively proxies assist functions user location 
case proxies routing initial signaling messages 
subsequent messages exchanged 
consequence signaling paradigm call state instantiation telephony features 
internet multi service service independent 
provides packet level transport endto services deployed systems higher layer protocols software 
leads tremendous flexibility extensibility 
new application level services web email ip telephony created deployed access internet 
ip telephony separates call setup reserving resources 
internet protocols rsvp reserve resources 
protocols application independent reservations may take place actual flow data begins 
flow data begins data treated best effort 
result ip telephony call resource reservation networks sufficient capacity 
hand removing atomicity call setup current telephone system breaks assumption call completion call setup resource reservation distinct may succeed may fail 
resources reserved caller may incur cost holding resources phone rings call answered 
network charge reservations network vulnerable denial service attacks attacker block making reservations 
phone system resource needs single leg call known ahead time clearly case internet telephony calls callee may choose communicate subset media offered caller 
due limited signaling abilities systems addresses phone numbers overloaded functions point identification service indication indication pays call carrier selection 
ties call origination payment modified address numbers specific manual features collect calls 
addresses formulated url solely endpoint identification basic service indication

internet telephony offers larger degree freedom allocate functions network servers user supplied operated systems 
example signaling phone services distinctive ringing call urgency media endpoint selection cryptographically authenticated caller id addition features available pots phones speed dialing caller id may accomplished trivially standalone ip telephones resulting better scaling 
phone system employs different signaling protocols user network user network interface uni compared implicitly trusted network elements network network interface 
certain features translation unavailable users leads classifying users networks attendant security implications access databases network resources 
uni distinction exist internet level data transport signaling 
sip set calls systems just easily creating channel aggregated rtp session see section 
open multi service nature internet means various components telephony services provided completely different service vendors course agreement protocols necessary interoperability 
example vendor provide name ip address mapping service provide voice mail provide mobility services provide conferencing services 
furthermore nature internet means internet connection run operate service 
leads easy entry highly competitive marketplace internet services ip telephony 
separation functionality simplifies number portability problem 
organization may provide just name mapping service user change service providers voicemail provider isp change name 
changing name providers may require change name 
automated white pages services run allow layer indirection alleviates number portability problem 
features internet telephony architectural differences described previous section lead number advantages user perspective carrier perspective just cheaper phone calls adjustable quality currently reputation tin quality due low bitrate codecs part reason lack bandwidth technology supply music 
internet service specific network media exchanged chosen entirely systems 
systems control amount compression network bandwidth content transmitted 
example music hold speech suitable low bit rate speech codecs 
security internet reputation insecure probably easier tap telephone box router 
sip encrypt authenticate signaling messages rtp supports encryption media 
provide cryptographically secure communications 
user identification standard pots isdn telephone service offers caller id indicating number occasionally name caller bridged multi party conference indication talking 
real time transport protocol rtp internet telephony easily supports talker indication multicast bridged configurations convey detailed information caller desires 
difficult issue maintaining ip network address changing providers 
user interface pots isdn telephones limited user interface best liquid crystal display public network cryptic commands call back 
advanced features call forwarding rarely customized sequence steps typically intuitive 
due part limited signaling capabilities systems general notion network intelligence compared system intelligence 
ip telephony systems richer signaling capabilities graphical user interface offered internet telephony readily customized offer richer indications features process progress 
computer telephony integration complete separation data control paths separation phone equipment pc controlling computer telephony integration cti complex specs running pages 
call handling functionality easily accomplished data control path pass intelligent network connected systems 
feature ubiquity current phone system offers different features depending parties connected private branch exchange pbx reside local calling area connected long distance carrier 
trivial features caller id small fraction international calls example 
pbx may allow call forwarded outside pbx cause forwarded call go pbx 
internet telephony suffer problem 
internet protocols internationally services defined largely systems 
multimedia pointed adding additional media video shared whiteboards shared applications easier internet environment compared pots isdn multiplexing natural packet networks 
signaling protocols simpler issues channel allocation synchronization non existent internet 
carriers benefit silence suppression compression sending audio packets easy suppress silence periods reducing bandwidth consumption particularly multi party conference voice announcement systems 
generally silence suppression trans continental links ip telephony performs silence suppression endpoints 
furthermore packet networks suitable multiplexing network support required take advantage system silence suppression 
leads reduction cost perform silence suppression distributed systems done cheaply improvement scope benefits 
furthermore compression systems reduce bandwidth consumption entire network 
unfortunately compression odds enhanced voice quality services described 
exist codecs compress wideband speech kb give excellent voice quality reduced bandwidth compared 
note silence suppression compression compensate decreased efficiency packet switching 
shared facilities largest operational savings probably come provisioning managing single integrated network separate voice data signaling networks 
advanced services experiences protocols appears far simpler develop deploy advanced telephony services packet switched environment 
internet protocols sip support standard class custom local area signaling services features call forward answer take tens pages specify 
perform functions user network signaling protocols network signaling signaling system 
separation voice control flow telephony signaling flow carried separate network touch intermediate switches set circuit 
packet forwarding internet requires setup internet call control concentrate call connection functionality

network connection state needs torn 
rtp data transport real time flows voice video streams number common requirements distinguish traditional internet data services sequencing packets re ordered real time receiver arrive order 
packet lost detected compensated retransmissions 
intra media synchronization amount time successive packets conveyed 
example data usually sent silence periods speech

rtp second rtcp real time control protocol 
transport protocols real time media new dating back 
rtp provides functionality loss detection multicast friendly rtp rtcp engineered multicast 
fact designed operate small multicast groups person phone call huge ones broadcast events 
media independent rtp provides services needed generic real time media voice video 
codec specific additional header fields semantics defined media codec separate specifications 
translators devices take media users mix bridge media stream send resulting stream 
translators take single media stream convert format send 
translators useful reducing bandwidth requirements stream sending low bandwidth link requiring rtp source reduce bitrate 
allows receivers connected fast links receive high quality media 
limit bandwidth sources send data simultaneously fulfilling function conference bridge 
rtp includes explicit support translators 
qos feedback rtcp allows receivers provide feedback members group quality reception 
rtp sources may information adjust data rate receivers determine quality service qos problems local network wide 
external observers scalable quality service management 
loose session control rtcp participants exchange identification information name email phone number brief messages

payload type identifies media encoding packet 
sequence number increments sequentially packet detect losses restore packet order 
timestamp incremented media sampling frequency indicates media frame generated 
payload may contain headers specific media described detail 
rtcp control management real time control protocol rtcp companion control protocol rtp 
media senders sources receivers sinks periodically send rtcp packets multicast group different ports distribute rtp packets 
rtcp packet contains number elements usually sender report sr receiver report followed source descriptions sdes 
serves different function sender reports sr generated users sending media rtp sources 
describe amount data sent far correlating rtp sampling timestamp absolute wall clock time allow synchronization different media 
receiver reports rr sent rtp session participants receiving media rtp sinks

block describes instantaneous cumulative loss rate jitter source 
block indicates timestamp delay receiving sender report allowing sources estimate distance sinks 
source descriptor sdes packets session control 
contain cname canonical name globally unique identifier similar format email address 
cname resolving conflicts ssrc value associate different media streams generated user 
sdes packets identify participant name email phone number 
provides simple form session control 
client applications display name email information user interface 
allows session participants learn participants session 
allows obtain contact information email phone allow forms communication initiation separate conference sip 
easier contact user example left camera running 
user leaving includes bye message 
application app elements add application specific information rtcp packets 
sender reports receiver reports sdes packets contain information continually change necessary send packets periodically 
rtp session participants simply sent rtcp packets fixed period resulting bandwidth multicast group grow linearly group size 
clearly undesirable 
session member counts number session members hears rtcp packets 
period rtcp packets user set scale linearly number group members 
ensures bandwidth rtcp reports remains fixed independent group size 
group size estimate obtained counting number participants takes time new participant converge correct group size count 
users simultaneously join group common broadcast applications user incorrect low estimate group size 
result flood rtcp reports 
back algorithm called reconsideration prevent floods 
payload formats mechanisms rtp provide services needed generic transport audio video 
particular codecs additional requirements information needs conveyed 
support rtp allows payload formats defined particular codec 
payload formats describe syntax semantics rtp payload 
particular semantic payload communicated rtp payload type indicator bits 
bits mapped actual codecs formats binding names registered internet assigned numbers authority iana conveyed band sdp example 
number bindings conveyed band allows rtp source change encoding formats mid stream explicit signaling 
furthermore register name long procedures defined doing 
allows rtp kind codec developed 
rtp media payload formats defined jpeg mpeg video codecs host audio video encoders supported simpler payload formats 
furthermore rtp payload formats defined provide generic services 
format redundant audio codings allows user transmit audio content multiple audio codecs delayed previous lower bitrate 
allows lost packets recovered subsequent packets albeit lower quality codec 
payload format defined parity reed solomon forward error correction fec mechanisms allow recovery lost packets codec independent manner 
format introduced multiplex media multiple users single packet 
particularly useful trunk replacement internet telephony gateways provide significant reduction packet header overheads 
resource reservation importance telephony services anticipate significant fraction internet bandwidth consumed voice video rtp protocols 
due tight delay constraints streams candidates guaranteed qos 
unfortunately existing proposals rsvp complex largely due features receiver orientation support receiver diversity limited internet telephony 
proposed dispense separate resource reservation protocol altogether simply rtcp messages tell routers path reserve sufficient resources 
determine amount bandwidth reservation rtcp sender reports sr observing difference subsequent sr byte counts additional field inserted specifies desired grade service detail 
rtcp messages carrying reservation requests marked special handling router alert option 
receiver reports back reservation completely partially successful 
similar proposals simplified sender resource reservation protocols albeit rtcp scalable reservation protocol srp 
issue reservations services facet reservation fails call take place best effort transport audio 
certainly preferable fast busy signal communications established 
introduces possibility completely removing admission decision 
link network sufficient bandwidth voice traffic allocated 
time honored approaches telephone network engineering determine amount allocation needed 
remaining bandwidth links services best effort 
incoming packets classified voice non voice 
voice connections active point time possible admission control extra calls simply best effort 
network engineering place reasonably low probabilities event spillover best effort bandwidth eliminate admission control handle occurrences 
mechanism generally referred part class ip service referred differentiated services 
rely user subscription facilitate network engineering packet classification marking network 
discussion prime candidate service 
fact premium service provides delay jitter packets making ideal real time voice video 
signaling session initiation protocol defining property ability party signal parties initiate new call 
purposes discussing session initiation protocol define call association number participants 
signaling association pair participants call referred connection 
note physical channel network resources associated connection connection exists signaling state endpoints 
session refers single rtp session carrying single media type 
relationship signaling connections media sessions varied 
multiparty call example participant may connection participant media distributed multicast case single media session 
cases may single unicast media session associated connection 
complex scenarios possible 
ip telephony signaling protocol accomplish number functions name translation user location involve mapping names different levels abstraction common name domain user name particular internet host 
translation necessary order determine ip address host exchange media 
usually user name email address person communicate doe com example 
translated ip address 
translation just simple table lookup

protocol extensions immature additional signaling capabilities needed 
individual implementations vendors may want add additional features 
sip designed client inquire server abilities proceed assumption server supports extension back assumption wrong 
methods additional methods introduced 
server signals error method requested client supported informs public allow response headers methods support 
options request returns list available methods 
request response headers simple mail transport protocol smtp client server add request response headers crucial interpreting request response explicit indication 
entity receiving header simply silently ignores headers understand 
mechanism sufficient allow client include headers vital interpreting request 
enumerating need know non standard headers sip required header indicates features client needs server 
server refuse request understand features enumerated 
feature names registered internet assigned number authority iana derived hierarchically feature owner internet domain name giving hints information 
sip uses ascertain telephony call control functions supported avoiding problem partial implementations unpredictable sets optional features 
status codes status codes returned responses classified significant digit client knows request successful failed temporarily permanently 
textual status message offers fall back mechanism allows server provide human readable information 
telephony services sip takes different approach standard telephony defining services 
explicitly describing implementation particular service provides number elements headers methods construct services 
principle headers replaces 
request response header instructs recipient place call parties listed 
similarly replaces instructs recipient terminate connections parties listed 
additional method called status provided allow client obtain results progress calls requested header 
elements basic sip components easily construct variety traditional telephony services 
services permanent numbers paid information services call control perspective simply special cases call forwarding governed database lookup server specified algorithm 
charging mechanisms differ services handled protocols orthogonal fashion 
intelligent networking number lookups call limited 
call forwarding services user status preferences similarly require additional protocol machinery 
simple example implemented automatic call forwarding mechanism inspects callee appointment calendar forward calls indicate opportune time call back 
call forwarding precedes call call transfer allows direct call participant connect different subscriber 
transfer services include blind supervised call transfer attendant operator services auto interactive voice response 
supported header combined programmed behavior specific particular service 
example blind transfer implemented having transferring party send bye transferred party containing header listing transferred party 
sip call setup session parameter modification accomplished invite request sip requests idempotent 
internet environment lines tied active calls media sent 
means ip telephone support unlimited number active calls time 
easy example implement call waiting camp 
multi party calls sip supports basic modes creating multiparty conferences combinations multicast bridges known multipoint control units mesh unicast connections 
multicast conferences require protocol support listing group address session description caller member multicast group issue invitation 
bridges introduced regular session members may take branches mesh replaces header participants needing aware bridge serving conference 
sip supports conferences full mesh known multi unicast 
case client maintains point point connection participant 
mode inefficient useful small conferences bridges multicast service available 
full meshes built easily header 
example add participant call users user send header containing address mixes multi unicast multicast bridges possible 
sip set calls callees

alternatively single address sysadmin acme com may reach available administrator 
servers fan invitation requests including sending multicast 
multicast invitations particularly useful inviting members department product team example com conference extremely efficient manner requiring central list administration
