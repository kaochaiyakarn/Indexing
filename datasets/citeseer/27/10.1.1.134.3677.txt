idea underlying approach set data sources manually mapped mediated schema system able glean significant information mappings successfully propose mappings subsequent data sources 
example consider data integration system helps users find houses real estate market 
mediated schema domain may contain elements house address price contact phone listing address house price phone contact person respectively see 
suppose source com provide source description manually 
specifically suppose source contains elements house location listed price agent phone mapping specifies elements match elements house address price contact phone mediated schema respectively 
things machine learning program glean mapping 
looks data source examples home addresses home prices phone numbers create recognizers elements 
second system learn looking names elements 
example knowing source element agent phone matches contact phone may hypothesize word agent phone element name indicative element contact phone 
system learn properties data 
example small numbers tend indicate numbers rooms prices houses 
example phone numbers element significant commonalities phone numbers office phones employees home phones 
program learn proximity elements 
example real estate domain happens long text field house entry house description agent phones tend appear name real estate agency 
general different types information learner exploit names formats word frequencies positions characteristics value distribution 
clearly single learner able exploit effectively types information 
takes multi strategy learning approach 
apply set learn com

describe lsd learning source descriptions system built testing approach initial experimental results 
results show current set learners obtain predictive accuracy prediction fairly complex domain real estate data sources 
currently focuses finding toone mappings leaf elements source schemas 
learning source descriptions versus wrapper learning emphasize learning problem consider different problem learning wrappers 
wrappers programs convert data coming source say html format structured representation data integration system manipulate xml 
wrapper learning focus extracting structure html pages 
contrast focus finding semantic mapping tags attributes data source mediated schema 
discussion assume data source xml 

schema matching problem schema definition model schema tree nodes xml tag names 
shows fragment mediated schema fragment source schema refer nodes schema tree schema elements 
schema element name values called instances 
schema tree element child element simply means instance may contain instance example name schema element corresponding address house house address instances text strings specifying address ave seattle wa th str 
string contains instance element city seattle 
schema language considered simplified version xml dtd parent child child 
schema matching problem mediated schema tree source schema tree expressed schema language general schema matching problem find mappings schemas 
simplest type mapping mapping node source schema tree node tree mappings shown mentioned example 
complex types mapping include mappings node tree nodes tree num schema sum num full num half mappings node schema values node schema handicap equipped values schema maps value handicap equipment available amenities schema 
step focus finding mappings nodes elements schema trees 
specifically limit investigations finding mappings leaf elements source schemas 
matching source schema elements higher levels requires developing learning methods deal structures topic currently exploring 

lsd approach explain detail machine learning approach works 
discussion shall labels refer mediated schema elements 
refer process matching source schema element classifying element assigning proper label 
learning phase suppose start mediated schema shown create training data learning process manually matching schema elements source elements mediated schema

meta learner combines predictions learners form final prediction 
example meta learner may predict means data house object learners combined think matches proceed similar manner subsequent house objects 
process obtained prediction list contain prediction house object 
prediction combiner uses list predict final matching result element example list shown 
list prediction combiner may decide best matches 
learners principle learner issue label predictions weighted confidence score 
current implementation lsd modules nearest neighbor whirl learner naive bayesian learner name matcher county name recognizer 
whirl learner classifies input instance labels nearest neighbors training set 
uses tf idf similarity measure commonly employed information retrieval 
whirl performs best schema elements values verbose textual house descriptions free text paragraphs limited uniquely indicative type element color red green yellow 
source schema item item item item item item item naive bayesian learner exploits word frequencies works best words strongly indicative correct label virtue frequencies 
example works house descriptions frequently contain words beautiful fantastic words seldom appear elements 
works weakly suggestive words 
short numeric fields color zip code number 
name matcher matches schema elements similarity names allowing synonyms 
uses tf idf similarity measure 
learner works unambiguous names price house location fails names ambiguous office indicate office phone general item 
county name recognizer searches database pulled web verify instance county name 
module illustrates recognizers narrow specific area expertise incorporated system 
meta learner meta learner combines predictions base level learners machine learning method called stacking 
lsd meta learner linear discriminant machine 
uses training data learn combination label base level learner weight indicates relative importance learner label 
details learning process 
input instance label meta learner computes weighted sum confidence scores base level learners give label 
assigns label highest weighted sum input instance 
prediction combiner module uses simple heuristic assign label source schema element set instances labeled 
suppose label associated highest learners lk prediction lists corresponding global element meta learner classification phase lsd 
prediction combiner prediction object number instances label highest number instances 
label instances prespecified thresholds assign label report failure assign label heuristic similar heuristic purpose

questions consider higher accuracy obtain achieve degree accuracy 
answer questions currently identifying reasons prevent lsd correctly matching remaining elements considering extensions help obtain higher accuracy 
major reason causes lsd fail elements element type 
example lsd match element suburb seen word suburb name element recognize instances element names 
problem handled adding recognizers 
lsd subtle subjective distinctions clear boundary elements 
example failed distinguish lot description house description free text paragraphs 
quick fix concatenate instances element form mega document classify mega documents individual instances 
believe concatenating instances may amplify subtle distinction elements extent current learners distinguish 

related partially automating schema matching process classified rule learner approaches 
works rule approach include 
system performs matching name structure schema elements 
schemas represented tree structures labeled nodes node matches node label matches label allowing synonymous labels certain child nodes match certain child nodes case node leaf element amounts name matcher match system uses names structures domain types schema elements match schemas 
general existing rule systems utilize information inherent schemas approach exploits cent schemas data values schema elements perform matching 
works learner approach include 
system uses neural net learner 
ila system matches schemas comparing objects knows source mediated schema 
ila employ single type learner limited applicability 
example ila works sources share objects objects identified 
object identification done effectively real estate domain brokerage firms go great length conceal house identity giving partial house address avoid left process 
example neural net deal effectively textual elements 
note learners studied works approach easily incorporated system 
fact version lsd intend add object learner ila 

aim build data integration systems explore web find relevant sources add systems automatically learn descriptions 
built lsd prototype system uses machine learning automatically match source schemas mediated schema 
lsd employs diverse range learners draws knowledge different source 
lsd easily incorporate previous approaches provides broader range applicability 
applied lsd sources real estate domain 
experimental results demonstrate feasibility promise approach 
focused finding mappings leaf elements source schemas 
near explore range learning issues 
plan continue working improving lsd classification accuracy 
want add learners lsd develop new methods combine learners effectively 
interested learning recognizers narrow areas expertise applied domains 
plan investigate impact recognizers classification accuracy 
plan incorporating domain knowledge semantic integrity constraints learning process 
real world domains usually contain considerable amount nested structure elements 
important develop techniques exploit structure effectively match elements higher trees 
shall look learning matchings complex matchings consider extensions mediated schema 
particular elements usually form natural hierarchy concepts 
investigate exploit hierarchies improve learning
