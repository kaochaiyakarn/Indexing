regier perceptually grounded semantics typical example regier cf

fully grounded system system function internal mechanisms elements intrinsic system 
course don goes system produced labels completely ungrounded system concept doing produced labels 
means regier system considered fully grounded things missing discussed 
firstly created labels results transduction possibly considered grounded see harnad argument feature detector provide semantics 
act labelling transduction functional value labelling system sure intrinsic

accordingly labelling act sense agent agent able spatial labels way profit way developing capacity 
note stands long list requirements
