implementation section introduces implementation decisions integrate nonverbal communication networked virtual environment 
typically virtual environment simulation systems complex software systems modular design imposes 
appropriate design runtime system collection cooperating processes responsible particular task 
allows easier portability better performance system decoupling different tasks execution different processors multiprocessor machine 
multiprocess approach 
core processes external drivers core main process executes main simulation provides services basic elements ves external programs called drivers 
core consists logical units called engines 
role engine separate main function independent module provide orderly controlled allocation elements 
engine manages resource various programs competing object 
drivers provide simple flexible means access control complex functionalities 
engine provides shared memory interface driver connect 
drivers spawned main process session command line combinations drivers specified 
system point view nvc application facial expression driver mpa minimal perceptible actions format provides complete set basic facial actions allowing definition facial expression body posture driver controls motion user body 
virtual human animation parameters control virtual human body posture animation articulated structure corresponding human skeleton needed 
structures representing body shape attached skeleton clothes may wrapped body shape 
humanoid articulated human body model degrees freedom hands additional degrees freedom hand boulic 
skeleton represented articulated hierarchy joints realistic maximum minimum limits 
attached skeleton second layer consists blobs represent muscle skin 
runtime skin contour attached skeleton step interpolated link depending joint angles 
interpolated skin contour deformation component creates new body triangle mesh 
body information frame represented rotational joint angle values 
nonverbal communication application order fulfil need easy fast usage intuitive easy learn user interface decided image buttons displaying snapshot actual move textual label describing idea state mind expressed action 
decided windows posture gesture panel control panels 
posture panel offers global view postures available clickable image buttons 
constituted sections containing postures classified part body section face body 
actions ordered emotional impact sections divided columns positive negative neutral 
gesture panel organised way posture panel section head face hand arm body

nvc application interface gesture panel example nvc application integration nonverbal communication actions discussed nonverbal communication program visualized driver point view 
normally external driver able connect human posture interface task engine resolve conflicts external drivers 
example walking motor updates lower body application control upper part body 
human posture engine convert motions effects single virtual body posture 
solution combining motions transparent drivers 
drivers put values shared memory segment associated body animation engine combines values 
addition joint values driver associated priority weight joint angle 
default values priorities weights 
drivers right change priorities weight joint angle 
example walking arm motion combined way 
walking motion driver joints belonging upper part body default priority 
lower body joints higher priority 
walking motor effects visible lower part body 
similarly arm motion driver priority right arm joints 
gesture driver default priorities body 
effects gesture driver added equally arm motion walking motion parts body walking motor right arm 
motion combination achieved initial goal provide solution transparent driver communication necessary drivers indirect priorities weights
