comparing flooding odmrp notice lower speeds difference packet delivery ratio 
result agrees observed :10.1.1.34.1699
higher speeds gap packet delivery ratio starts widening 
case odmrp increased mobility requires forwarding group members updated frequently 
frequency routes refreshed periodic join queries remains constant change node speed 
way address problem update forwarding group members frequent join queries 
course result higher control overhead possibly greater packet loss due contention 
comparing odmrp maodv observe odmrp exhibits better roughly packet delivery ratios 
odmrp maintains meshes multiple redundant paths receivers affected mobility greatly maodv 
increased mobility causes frequent link changes requires maodv reconfigure multicast tree frequently prevent stale routing information 
turn requires higher control traffic negative effect increased packet loss due contention hidden terminals 
routing overhead control bytes data byte velocity km hr routing overhead vs mobility senders receivers kbps maodv routing overhead function node mobility plots control overhead data byte transferred function mobility 
note flooding overhead change mobility data header packets contribute overhead 
odmrp join query interval fixed seconds control overhead remains fairly constant node mobility 
slight increase overhead higher speeds km hr due fact number data bytes delivered decreases increased mobility 
case maodv increased mobility causes frequent link breakages data packet drops link outages generate repair messages increasing control overhead 
group reliability manets target mission critical applications scenarios require data transmission received multicast group members timely fashion quite common 
reliable transport protocol repair losses detected communication points having highest possible delivery rate underlying routing protocol improves system efficiency including response time

odmrp maintain multiple routes receivers mesh connectivity largely dependent number senders receivers 
case senders mesh connectivity insufficient ensure packet delivery group members especially node mobility resulting low group reliability 
maodv delivers packet multicast tree single packet drop upstream prevent large number downstream multicast receivers receiving packet 
absence redundant routes affects performance greatly node mobility results frequent link breakages packet drops 
effect multicast group size set experiments focus influence group size number receivers multicast routing performance

note flooding able keep delivery ratio fairly constant close different group sizes 
compared packet delivery ratio group size packet delivery ratio vs multicast group size senders kbps maodv packet delivery ratio function multicast group size odmrp flooding delivery ratio higher group size higher multicast group size increases 
interestingly odmrp delivery ratio increases group size increases 
consistent way mesh protocols operate 
instance odmrp mesh formed result join query join table process 
number receivers increase number join tables sent response join queries increases 
causes larger number nodes incorporated mesh forwarding group members increasing mesh connectivity redundancy 
packet delivery ratio tends increase increase multicast receivers 
case maodv packet delivery ratio decreases group size increases receivers lowers approximately receivers 
reason decrease previously mentioned packet loss upstream affects larger set receivers 
increased group size results greater number control messages transmitted result greater packet loss due collisions 
routing overhead shows control overhead varies group size

flooding overhead decreases increasing group size

rebroadcast packets effective control bytes data byte group size routing overhead vs multicast group size senders kbps maodv routing overhead function group size group size increases count packets delivered multicast receivers 
particular scenario odmrp routing overhead highest protocols group sizes 
due large number join tables transmitted greater redundancy number group members increases 
case maodv increased group size results larger number repair messages 
data packets travel multiple redundant paths resulting lower routing overhead maodv compared odmrp flooding 
group reliability group reliability group size group reliability vs multicast group size senders kbps maodv group reliability function group size shows group reliability varies group size 
expected group reliability protocol degrades larger multicast group size 
explained fact number receivers increase probability receiver receiving data packet increases

note flooding odmrp packet delivery ratio remain fairly constant number senders suffer increased contention higher number sources slight drop observed attributed data packet loss due collisions 
interesting counterintuitive result case maodv delivery ratio increases increase number traffic sources 
due fact maodv shared tree formed result rreq rrep process 
number senders increases greater number intermediate nodes path sender multicast tree grafted part tree 
helps increase redundancy certain links due presence multiple downstream neighbors potentially forward data tree 
packet delivery ratio tends increase increase number sources 
maodv packet delivery ratio consistently lower odmrp flooding 
routing overhead control bytes data byte senders routing overhead vs traffic sources receivers kbps maodv routing overhead function traffic sources depicts control overhead varies number traffic sources 
flooding transmit control messages routing overhead remains constant number senders 
odmrp increased sender population results larger number join reqs join tables 
join tables particular result large byte overhead carry nexthop information multiple sources 
similarly larger sender population results larger number maodv control messages transmitted 
discussed section number data bytes received increases 
maodv ratio control bytes data byte delivered remains fairly constant 
group reliability ratio senders group reliability vs traffic sources receivers kbps maodv group reliability function traffic sources group reliability shows group reliability varies number traffic sources 
interesting notice different reliability metrics capture different protocol behavior 
packet delivery ratio metric flooding maodv exhibit fairly high delivery ratios maodv delivers packets senders increases reliability close receivers shown 
group reliability metric depicted shows completely different behavior 
relative performance protocols remains odm rp aodv denotes performs better observe group reliability degrades considerably larger number senders 
effect mainly due increased contention larger number senders results number packets transmitted 
result greater number packets dropped due collisions

hyper flooding hyper flooding suitable highly mobile scenarios high reliability required

plain flooding node receives new data packet simply re broadcasts packet queues packet cache 
additionally re broadcasts triggered events receiving data packet node current neighbor list receiving hello message new neighbor
