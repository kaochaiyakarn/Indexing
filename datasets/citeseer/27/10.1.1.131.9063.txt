discussion ipl prototypes casablanca social communication prototypes internally informal demonstration sessions 
unstructured extensive discussions followed concluded intentionality aesthetics ipl attractive 
wary awareness prototype response 
industrial designers saw ipl challenge interaction design met 
curtain devices received strongly desired 
success ipl shows artifact convey unfamiliar concept particularly artifact strong production values appropriate user interactions 
scanning sharing attractive 
scanning physical objects shared virtual space produced novel intriguing user experience 
particularly satisfying scan share comic strips photographs able comment handwriting

designing social communication homes casablanca encompassed multiple investigations media space ideas incorporated households family life 
course project created early sets prototypes studied homes lightweight conducted exploratory market research novel social communication concepts 
findings efforts 
activities noteworthy follows homes distinct domain 
point emphasized 
casablanca showed repeatedly 

homes distinct design domain household priorities concerns quite different workplaces 
point expanded length related 
media spaces homes span wide range 
initial ideas bringing media spaces homes changed research 
media rich multimodal high bandwidth connectivity originally envisioned evolved simpler lightweight essentially asynchronous interactions 
pragmatics household internet communication altered slightly casablanca slow dial connections 
casablanca showed rich interactions high quality audio spaces received properly supported 
social communication suitable research topic 
casablanca demonstrated innovation design social communication devices possible 
furthermore household technology research area 
little adult women approach home technologies example 
promising topic homes privacy concerns households arose number ways 
surprised subtlety concerns see challenging aspect designing new communication technologies 
designers household communication devices casablanca yielded additional guidelines specific home context follows express just meaning 
designers need respect value perceived simplicity need information expressiveness part users 
social interaction imposed users 
designers need allow users fulfill existing social obligations adding new ones 
users feel increasingly obliged keep touch see added communication extra responsibilities 
starting point home media spaces casablanca project demonstrated space new domestic communications technologies enormous 
believe research produce new compelling ideas space 
obvious direction develop sufficiently realistic robust scalable devices lengthy home trials
