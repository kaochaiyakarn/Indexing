variations allowed bleu bleu attempts capture allowable variation translation goes

bleu underconstrained ways allows tremendous amount variation far reasonably considered acceptable variation translation

sections examine ways synthetically producing variant translations 
permuting phrases way variation introduced permuting phrases hypothesis translation 
simple way estimating lower bound number ways phrases hypothesis translation reordered examine bigram mismatches

number bigram matches hypothesis translation length 
possible ways generate similarly scored items words hypothesis translation 
example hypothesis translation different ways permuting sentence receiving similar bleu score 
number permutations varies respect sentence length number bigram mismatches 
hypothesis translation approaches identical match translations amount variance decreases significantly 
translations improve note cases randomly permuting sentence way may result greater number gram matches expect random permutation increase human evaluation
