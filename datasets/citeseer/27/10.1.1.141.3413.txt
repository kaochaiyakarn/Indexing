extended existing infrastructure news publishing system 
concerns mainly provide lightweight means ontology maintenance ease access repositories news items rich resource information sharing 
reason information shared providing ontology driven interest profiling tool enable users specify interests 
developed ontology driven heuristics find news items related users interests 
argues role ontology driven personalised web services information sharing 
nowadays observe trend providing personalized web services order accommodate versatile needs increasing number web users 
advances agent internet technology provide technological means equally important provide means semantic infrastructure 
goal huhns stephens propose personal ontologies web user able create ontology tailored view world 
idea fruitful bears contradictory connotation 
talk ontologies really say personal 
ontologies definition shared views world kalfoglou 
prefer metaphor personal views ontology tailored specific services 
user see eventually able edit part ontology tailored specific service 
ontology remain shared sense creation editing maintenance tasks involve efforts agents people software 
way exposed users depend kind services want 
example domain web news services user able browse contents ontology related news items people wrote projects mentioned kind web news services enable users access information tailored interests 
valuable information shared members community lowest common denominator medium email message 
users send story form email story news server designated systems redirect story back targeted members community 
indirect form communication comparison member member form enrich ontology driven interest profiling tool deductive knowledge retrieval techniques

describe tools sections 
ontological interest profiling limitations suite tools lack stories retrieval method enable users read stories interest forcing browse stories database potentially interesting items 
possible fix problem provide keyword search engine 
sort solution bears known limitations experienced current keyword search engines unrelated matches 
consequently worked method allows user specify interests crudely speaking search criteria search stories match interests

finding evidence relevance 
technique proved easy apply gave broader accurate answer set get simple match category name 
hand need careful identify devise cues particular category loosely defined cue phrase result loosely related stories 
example cue phrase survival fittest argued abstraction genetic algorithms research area describes common technique molecular biology genetic algorithms 
dangerous loosely connected term genetic algorithms possibility get unrelated stories high stories fighting contest contain phrase 
see tradeoff generic cue phrases phrases define devise generic cue phrases phrases define devise 
obvious cue phrases find stories phrases generic may result unrelated stories

means ignore parts news story relevant ontology template driven information extraction approaches approaches systems focus portions text relevant particular domain 
perspective seen task pulling pre defined relations texts see applications various domains see example 
furthermore partially parse piece text order recognise syntactic constructs need generating complete parse tree sentence 
approach coupled domain specific templates order identify relevant information 
extraction template applies parsed sentence information retrieved 
characteristics technology appealing task populate ontology new instances stories automated manner 
gave means identify part story processed domain specific templates possible fill slots ontology instances 
example story kmi domain interested extract name kmi projects kmi members kmi funding organisations kmi award bodies money awarded ignore rest 
described vargas vera kind information extracted determined pre defined templates typology events kmi planet ontology 
examples events visiting place people academic story send kmi planet 
conference event involving project forth 
currently event types defined ontology devise templates 
domain specific templates systems 
example template event type visiting people follows visited template matches sentence word list recognisable entity capable visiting place visited preposition recognisable range dates virtue syntactic features 
remaining tokens sentence ignored 
underlying kmi ontology instances identify proper names visitors kmi employees fails deploy named entity recogniser help identifying additional proper names visitors places 
template triggered main verb tense 
template trigger word verb visited 
riloff describes linguistic rules deployed help identify trigger words reliably 
example targeted information subject direct object verb trigger word main verb
