adaptable xml defined interfaces adaptive user interface mobile devices solutions defining user interface moment writing article 
providing details mention approaches grammar bnf event constraint uan user action notation particular direct manipulation widget 
xml efforts interesting provide flexibility easy manipulation 
efforts include xul extensible user interface language uiml user interface mark language 
investigated possibility rendering mark languages java awt swing converting interface definition formats xsl transformations xpath 
approach focused creating different middleware transformation different platforms java compatible transparent modification user interface 
prototyped solution run truly mobile environment mobile agents focused rendering user definition files multiple platforms different middlewares

approaches focused defining universal xml notation platform independent interface generation 
web applications adaptable user interfaces application servers oriented transform web contents various formats mobile devices wml 
different approaches exist 
microsoft industry leaders generation technology net offers mobile web forms 
forms restricted set components knowledge extended additional widgets 
component intelligent component transforms appearance function available resources 
controls highly bound net family languages 
unfortunately microsoft solutions available windows platforms number widgets limited desktop applications taken consideration 
industry leaders ibm slightly different approaches 
ibm transcoding publisher transforms web contents variety formats giving user possibility customisation transformation parameters 
interesting features javascript transformation automatic image format transformations included 
users able customize transformations order maximize quality output significant plus complex web applications side ibm commitment java multiple platforms supported 
drawback approach ability transform web contents centralized fashion 
traditional solutions web area exist consist parsing request information redirecting appropriate content 
content created separately device type stored separately 
user accesses server mobile device server recognize request type redirect user appropriate content 
solution significant overhead content created multiple times order support different formats 
scalability solution questioned 
approaches support different level web applications
