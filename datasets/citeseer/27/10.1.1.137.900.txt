security considerations security primary concern especially system intended deployment individual user homes 
briefly outline security threats applicable protocol described considered implementation protocol 
discuss possible approaches deal security issues raised 
point security concerns raised document outside scope discussion 
discussion consider security underlying sip protocol relates networked appliances 
assume physical security user home words analysis assumes internet adversary eavesdrop sip messages forge sip messages modify sip messages 
security threats importance security security concerns paramount designing system allows remote access home 
forged generic sip message usually annoyance forged command turn appliance home potential disaster 
methods verifying authenticity provided system allows remote home access 
particular sip communication home authenticated home firewall verified originated authorized individual case direct communication user home authorized service provider proxy case communication proxy 
second case service provider proxy verified communication originated individual authorized communicate home 
privacy concern users particularly messages contain information existence appliances home 
implementations provide methods private encrypted communication 
users may choose opt allowed opt checking proper authentication detailed 
security message responses important 
responses may eventually contain status information current temperature house faked response messages cause problems 
privacy general user want passive eavesdropper able determine content message 
applies body message contain command executed header fields may leak information devices owns 
example header field contain url addressed entity proposed section indicate device type location 
user may want know owns television certainly want know room television located 
moyer expires may page internet draft sip appliances november underlying architecture implemented provides direct control home domain intermediate proxies need trusted respect privacy appropriate fields suitably encrypted 
underlying architecture communication proxy deployed service provider network assumption trust intervening proxy inevitable 
register messages may require encryption registration takes place network outside home case communication proxy 
authentication user point view important concern proper authentication sip messages 
note messages direction user home home user require authentication 
authentication requirement messages user home obvious messages effect certain actions inside home 
response messages home user authenticated lest adversary insert fake acknowledge confirmed message fact original message received 
responses may eventually include status information temperature house alarm system turned 
addition authentication messages register messages may potentially require authentication 
registration done home case direct communication assumed cryptographic solutions necessary due physical security home network 
registration takes place outside network communication proxy messages authenticated 
authentication messages prevent fabrication modification masquerading 
issue directly resolved authentication replay attacks 
replay attacks defended ways 
simple way check repeated messages done example checking timestamp cseq fields previously stored messages 
limit number previously timestamps stored leaves open possibility replaying old message 
robust solution check old messages comparing timestamp field current system time 
note timestamp field maliciously modified assumed message authentication 
case synchronization clocks assumed solutions methods achieving privacy authentication generic sip messages appear general methods apply case addressing nas 
highlight important differences general sip security specific case remote home access 
security shared secret general sip security form public key technology employed provide security 
case remote access nas home shared secrets provide privacy authentication 
primary reasons difference general sip communication potentially occur parties case remote access home correspondence exists authorized users homes communicating 
second general sip communication frequently occurs parties prior contact opportunity generate shared secret 
case home access users opportunity designate shared secret communication home 
secret may shared home firewall case direct communication user home service provider proxy case communication proxy 
general secret key methods preferable public key methods due higher level security increased efficiency 
moyer expires may page internet draft sip appliances november note cases public key methods may preferable 
may advantageous provide implementations 
implementation details depend outside factors including requirements service provider initial installation billing record keeping supported remote access methods 
encryption sip rfc describes methods achieving privacy encrypt hop hop 
particular setting remote access home recommend encryption 
encryption certainly efficient user home firewall service provider proxy share secret key need rely hop hop encryption 
furthermore hop hop encryption requires trust proxy message path encryption requires trust final ua performs decryption home firewall service provider proxy 
distinguish cases 
may direct communication user home decryption verification authenticity done home firewall 
case original message user encrypted authenticated secret key shared user home 
second case communication proxy outside home domain service provider deployed proxy 
scenario message user encrypted authenticated key shared user service provider proxy 
receipt message service provider proxy verifies authenticity message decrypts 
message authenticated encrypted key shared service provider proxy home forwarded home note step may handled establishment secure ipsec tunnel service provider proxy home 
forwarded message authenticated having come service provider proxy decrypted home firewall allowed inside home 
technically longer encryption prefer think way intermediate proxies path user service provider proxy message re encrypted hop 
encryption field major difference document header field contains potentially sensitive information device names locations encrypted
