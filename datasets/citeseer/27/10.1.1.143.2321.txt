logical interpretation rdf wolfram reinhold information systems software techniques germany essen essen germany de reinhold uni essen de discussion version october preface note reader step logic formalization rdf 
grew necessity precisely capture semantics rdf schemata developing modeling framework web applications 
rules facts described allow validate rdf triple sets 
exciting vrp 
relevant schema constructs required restrict modify extend initial semantics example monotone inheritance typed containers 
cases rules allow precise interpretation introduced schema constructs extend basic rule set provided 
rules xml rdf natural extension preciseness semantic expressibility rdf schema definitions 
rdf schema definition syntax may accompanied document defining semantics logically 
starts pretty interesting 
require extend parsers logic inference engine done 
remarks philosophy tried retain rdf spirit possible 
avoided example introduce new meta constructs designed rules way violations constraints explicitly detected avoids leave knowledge base inconsistent state may happen negated facts asserted 
way violation predicates queried appropriate actions determined interpreting application 
resolve ambiguities said decisions simply haven ambiguities strict sense 
tried point problems applying rules may occur 
rules negations knowledge level interpret triples making certain relationships explicit instanceof predicate stratified contrary statement due triple nature rdf statements reasonable stratification true representation level 
nice natural model theoretic interpretation rules exist 
rules facts easily fed datalog interpreter 
inference engines sld resolution may problems subpropertyof rules problem rules top depth inference mechanisms 
needs mentioned easy query triples specific query language needed logic datalog relational algebra sql 
content rdf instance simple approach embedded triple predicate statement 
may render querying little bit tedious 
may turn nicer sense transform rdf predicates knowledge base predicates see example logic encoding triples 
hope rule set may step improved semantic interoperability explicit machine readable uses known formalism rules transmitted client
