main motivation structured data allow asking queries asked data text form 
typical example query retrieve hotels downtown new york daily rate smaller 
discuss innovative example approach extracting data set web pages populating database 
consider web pages inherent structure readily recognized 
structure appears implicitly pages vary page say data semi structured 
extract data need description extract 
common approach providing description build specific grammar details surroundings piece data extract 
consider new approach description leave university brazil 
extract fully small set examples provided user 
idea propose top strategy extracts complex objects decomposing objects complex atomic objects extracted 
experimentation demonstrate just couple examples sufficient extracting hundreds objects new web pages 
approach simple intuitively appealing quite effective suffer main drawbacks alternative approaches literature discussed 
number different approaches proposed extracting data web sources :10.1.1.54.3298:10.1.1.138.1955
common approaches involves wrappers 
wrappers provide effective approach data extraction web sources major drawbacks 
firstly require previous knowledge structure data source 
secondly additional required adapt wrapper source changes 
alternative approach extracting data web sources natural language processing nlp 
approach nlp techniques find relevant fragments extracted source document 
system described example tool uses techniques 
extraction tools nlp techniques effective specific usually demand large number training examples 
ontology approach extracting data web sources :10.1.1.138.1955
approach uses semantic data model provide ontology describes data interest location source pages including relationships lexical appearances context keywords 
approach quite effective called data rich narrow ontological breadth web sources suffers problems similar faced wrapper approaches sense requires previous knowledge data source 
specific interesting approach extracting tabular data web sources provided table information text inquery 
tool extracts tabular data unstructured documents purely structural analysis documents 
heuristics recognize headings values compose different columns table

problem consider portion web page obtained db lp site illustrated 
notice inherent structure text page 
instance able distinguish objects object identify attributes authors title 
structure declared clearly identifiable 
texts pages type inherent 
web page db lp site illustrating data rich example acm tods 
structure said data rich narrow ontological breadth 
pages constitute target study referred simply data rich pages 
set data rich pages investigate extract objects attributes inserted nested tables querying 
properly done allow retrieving information obtained standard text searching techniques 
instance interested titles published author longer pages 
notice information page obtained standard text retrieval techniques 
able extract information set data rich pages need type description ex tract 
instance assume existence grammar detailing parse recognize tokens insertion table 
example grammar specify names authors appear black dot separated commas 
grammar state title appears line immediately line containing names authors 
main weakness grammar approaches rigid processing typical text appear practical situations particularly web 
instance entry missing black dot identifies object missing information authors information title appears prior information authors 
deal situations designer grammar anticipate exceptions occur practice adapt grammar accordingly 
clearly task quite hard loose domains web 
take different approach assume informed user simply specifies examples objects extract 
examples study extract data new pages similar structure presence mismatches variation ordering attributes inconsistent implicit structure 
user provides examples cutting pieces data page assembling example object 
example object investigate process new pages recognize objects extract objects insert table querying 
expect couple example objects suffice allow processing hundreds new similar structure pages 
consider example object user provides complex object hierarchical structure 
instance web page user specify level hierarchical example illustrated

nested table containing extracted objects pages appeared september 
object properly structured directly inserted nested table querying illustrated 
nested table flattened querying standard relational table 
piece data example object assume know position original page came 
instance author name dennis shasha initiates second non blank character ninth non blank line 
assume existence graphical tool allows user mark pieces data page drag positional information trivially generated storing positions text pieces marked expert 
tool implemented refer reader details 
positional information easy obtain represents crucial piece evidence assisting data extraction process demonstrate 
small set example objects conceive strategy extracting data new pages similar structure 
strategy roughly algorithm described consider moment examples provided user flat single level hierarchical structure 
algorithm works assembling context object context description identify new objects new pages 
context describes surroundings object provided example expert 
despite simplicity approach call top works data rich pages presenting variations structure 
strategy discussed details section 
foreach example object attribute foreach determine local text context piece data associated combine local contexts generate context object context description recognize extract new objects pages 
sketch top extraction algorithm 
attribute value pair avp patterns specify example user selects pieces data uses atomic components example object 
piece data selected called value atomic component referred attribute 
terminology attribute value pair avp refer attribute values 
attribute multiple values form list 
case say attribute complex component 
recognition extraction implicit objects page notion local context attribute value pair avp 
local contexts derived text avp occurs follows 
consider position text web page avp value selected user 
terms surrounding avp value constitute passage window local context 
instance illustrates avp value eric simon seen selected user page web browser 
illustrates passage local context value selected occurs html source page 
context information build pattern called avp pattern identify author name eric simon 
dennis shasha llirbat francois eric simon patrick valduriez eric simon eric html simon href indices 
avp value eric simon local context passage 
illustrate avp pattern corresponding avp value eric simon shown 
simon eric html href indices 
avp pattern corresponding passage 
case symbol represents string pattern matches sequence characters length 
avp pattern match author name appears context similar 
avp pattern retrieve author name page 
able effectively avp pattern extracting new author names adopt flexible pattern recognition strategy 
accomplished follows 
avp selected user determine passage surrounding avp value text 
adopt symmetric passages composed terms right terms left avp value 
restrictions apply passage go textual newline mark new passage overlap passages corresponding previous avp values selected user 
due restrictions avp pattern asymmetric 
width avp pattern determined empirically type avp follows 
start small pattern represented symbol term right term left 
terms words special symbols 
instance initial avp pattern composed symbol surrounded prefix suffix 
notice prefix suffix page recognized automatically user marks eric simon value interest 
parse excerpt page user selects avp value compare avp pattern just defined count number matches 
ask user number string values authors names see compare number matches just counted 
number matches exceeds number specified user add additional terms pattern increasing width amount contextual information attached 
process repeated automatically definition local context avp consideration number matches smaller number values identified user 
notice user provide single number indicates number occurrences values authors names excerpt web page working 
information quite simple provide presents inconvenience user 
avp patterns generated building blocks extraction strategy discuss 
top extraction discuss top strategy extract complex objects data rich web sources 
discussing details proposed strategy define basic concepts terminology required deal hierarchical structure complex objects

discussion notation attribute atomic component object component atomic complex pattern function returns avp pattern attribute function works discussed section detailed pattern function returns pattern object nil initialize object pattern string traverse structure pre order visit components foreach visited component case type pattern pattern complex atomic pattern list return function extracts set objects similar top extraction set variable holding extracted objects foreach page page string string match pattern object string string return 
detailed top extraction algorithm 
example object specified user set sample pages extracting data single page set top extraction strategy follows main steps section 
central idea find new objects structure identical structure object provided example 
consider attribute replaced respective avp pattern 
example object combines information object structure information avp patterns associated attributes 
crucial aspect allows extraction procedure example object 
detailed view top extraction algorithm 
top extraction function applies string pattern object generated function pattern page set pages strings match pattern retrieved 
strings corresponds new complex object components readily determined top decomposition operation performed function object string 
new complex object stored result variable function pattern core top extraction strategy 
works traversing structure object pre order visiting components concatenating respective avp patterns resultant object pattern concatenation operation strings indicated dot 
atomic component leads direct concatenation avp pattern wild character resultant pattern complex component object list requires deriving pattern recursive call function pattern prior concatenation 
list object requires deriving pattern surrounding strings indicate repetition allowed list
