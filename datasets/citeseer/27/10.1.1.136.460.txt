second key idea mentioned 
generically think schema 
schemata offer string decomposition different elements space members

complicates life greatly find useful decomposition problem time guarantee remain useful decomposition indefinitely 
coarse graining schemata known scientist engineer model system captures relevant features ignores irrelevant details 
irrelevant details think coarse graining
