franklin reiter protocol sealed bid auction fr 
protocol uses set distributed auctioneers features innovative primitive called verifiable secret sharing 
protocol successfully prevents single auctioneer altering bid throwing auction single bidder 
unfortunately protocol results auctioneers knowing bids auction decided 
question arises hold true private bid auction 
powerful set theoretical computer science tools known secure distributed computation protocols certainly answer question affirmatively 
examples secure distributed computation include yao protocol yao allows parties determine richer revealing wealth goldreich micali wigderson protocols bitwise oblivious transfer gmw chaum damgard protocol computing xor existence secure blobs ccd ben goldwasser wigderson protocols arithmetic operations simulate arbitrary logical circuits bgw protocols including rb bmr bg 
protocols simulate ar circuits solve computable problem require extensive communication computation 
dramatic explosion communication phases number communication phases constant multiple depth circuit performs desired function 
improvements initial results methods immediately applicable real time auction applications 
contains effort techniques usable auction setting 
consider efficient protocol electronic auctions multiparty secret computation protocol 
franklin reiter protocol distributed set auctioneers open bid 
note dealing passive attacks groups auctioneers eavesdroppers collaborate information 
auction methods deals active attacks auctioneers attempt actively lie values receive see fr 
protocol value specific bids kept secret termination auction 
round auction constant number communication phases 
round auction bidders place bid constant number values example bidding item round auction may auction values 
round auction results maximum bid tie value say place bids refined auction 
increase size bid increases decrease increase likelihood multiple rounds 
analyze protocol real time auctions need find optimal values preliminary auction styles auctions divided different types public bids vs secret bids public bid auction bids known parties 
example classical english auction type sees christie bidder announces bid publically 
prices increase increment 
secret bid auction sealed bid auction values bids kept secret 
auctioneer knows value bids 
go secret bid auction consider extremely secret auctions value bid held private auctioneer 
constant time vs time proportional price constant time auction requires constant number communication phases 
example auction phase bids submitted auctioneer phase result announced 
contrast auction mechanisms english auction dutch auction require phases communication 
example english auction phases communication proportional final price charged item 
aspire find single round auction 
unfortunately tie require additional auction round break tie 
trade amount information sent auction round probability auction terminate tie round 
studies trade variety assumptions distribution auction bids 
furthermore please note allow run rounds auction longer strictly sealed bid max price auction 
proposing effectively hybrid traditional sealed bid max price auctions english auctions 
requirements specify requirements auction privacy auction bid revealed winning bid 
non repudiation winner bid 
attackers easily mount denial ofservice attacks 
note weaker definition nonrepudiation franklin reiter deposit digital cash ensure payment collected winner cooperation fr 
efficiency want auction run quickly 
protocol definition model assume bidders auctioneers seller 
assume auctioneers conspire try reveal value hidden bid 
overview seller auctioneers bidders auction model basic idea secure addition bgw rb 
protocol works follows 
bidder prepares bid vector bid bidding prices 
valuation higher price bids secret id value bids 
bid vectors securely privately added 
possible cases 
single bidder bids particular price result equals bidder id value 
course bidder knows identity 

bidder bids particular price result sum bidders id values 
bidders compare bids sum vector see competitors price 

bids particular price result 
bidders secret id values randomly generated price encrypted seller public key order ensure anonymity 
example jth bidders id value idj ea da jjr da secret id value digitally signed authority seller 
ea encryption function public key 
signed identity da prevents bidder assuming false identity 
independent random padding concatenated price independent identities generated price 
entire bid vector containing bids signed bidder sent phase communication 
protocol definition protocol auctioneer associated distinct point zp duration protocol 
step polling 
seller publishes prices 
step bidding th bidder picks random polynomials form atx mod sends th auctioneer ng mg 
coefficients uniformly randomly chosen polynomial 
recall maximum number auctioneers 
free variable set idj willing bid price 
step opening 
th auctioneer computes fn prices sends result auctioneers seller 
points aggregate polynomial auctioneer uses lagrange interpolation style shamir secret sharing sh inverse fft certain choices solve simultaneous equations obtain free variable 
variable gives sum bidders bidding price 
step declaring 
seller decrypts winner bid idj private key retrieves winner identity verifying signature da seller awards item winner example bidders auctioneers 
range bidding value 
bidder bids picks polynomials id id id mod denotes th bidder bid price id nd secret id recall secret id unique random padding 
suppose bidder bids respectively 
distribution bids auctioneer adds polynomials prices publishes result point aggregate polynomial mod 
way auctioneers publish different points polynomial result follows id id id mod id id id mod id id id mod id id mod id id mod id id mod id mod mod case shows highest bid winner second bidder 
note auctioneer know highest bid 
seller winner know identity winner 
simplified protocol secret sharing scheme wise independent values compute sum vector bids 
protocol step bidding 
th bidder chooses random matrix bj bj bj bj bj bj row satisfies mx mod vj id mod vj vj th bidders valuation 
jth bidder sends th auctioneer vector bj 
receiving bids auctioneer sum bids calling summed vector ck 
bidders commit vector way function publish results 
sum defined cl cl cl mod cl bnl mod step declaring 
cj highest sum 
price exists single bidder price sum cj equal secret id idi winner verify checking cj idi seller decrypts sum cj check validity bid price high probability value decrypt properly 
secret multiple rounds auction simulate number different auctions technique 
strawman protocols fourth generalized tree structure generally practical 

secret english auction hold auction round bidding price tie continue bidding price 
gives nice slow auction acts english auction preserves privacy 

secret dutch auction similarly descending prices bidder places bid 
method slow 

binary tree auction set highest valid bidding value 
consider set domain interval 

party bids sets higher interval contains bid recurse restricted domain 
recurse lower value interval 
auction ends exactly bidder left higher interval 

hierarchical auction generalize binary tree auction replacing binary price polling prices defined ith slot indicates bid range 
iv 
look highest region receiving bid 
bid winning bid recurse dividing winning range sub divisions 
shows example tree auction 
processing tree auction increases number rounds decreases length bid vector increases 
question value optimizes expected cost entire auction 
note reason different rounds may situation varying rounds efficient appear relatively simple model 
estimation renormalizing arbitrary distributions mention auction protocol tradeoff 
allow fine grained bids linearly increase length bid sent round auction 
switch coarsegrained bids result likelihood auction rounds 
optimal tradeoff 
answer course depends heavily probability distribution bids 
know probability distribution optimal distribution bids 
discussion assuming bids independent 
parties object 
isn need auction uncertainty bids 
knew advance don need auction simply set fixed price 
truth believe lies middle 
case commodity rsvp network bandwidth repeatedly auctioned usually case probability distribution bids move slowly bids 
case set appropriate probability distribution revise necessary 
auction round consist series ranges 
raises bit paradox giving participants expected distribution leaks information seller buyers 
anticipate information derived successive private auctions don leakage information sellers buyers 
probability distribution bid want set dx effect acts uniform distribution 
consider case bids independently uniformly distributed 
number tied winners number bidders dividing factor 
bids uniformly independently distributed probability particular slot highest bid particular bidder probability bidders highest bid pn shows probability density function pn 
density function reaches maximum approximated 
density function number tied winners auction completes highest slot just bid 
setting probability completion illustrate probability probability completion approximation number rounds expected number rounds 
summing equation approximate follows pn note just binomial distribution mean variance expected number tied winners turn expected number bidders round 
approximation expected number winners rounds ni ni original number bidders round 
auction ends just winner remains expected number rounds log 
expected number rounds analysis approximation 
suppose approximation 
round expected number tied bidders pni pni turn initial population ni round 
value decrease exponentially number rounds see example approximation expected number tied winners true value solid line approximation dashed line 
similarly expected number rounds nr shown approximation shown dashed line 
exact value approximation expected numbers rounds communication costs optimum dividing factor 
ca cb bandwidth auctioneer bidders respectively 
typically cb greater equal ca 
polynomial method discussed section bidder sends qm bits round channel cb bps number bits modulus 
note slightly reduce message length submitting vector zero bids thought bidding lowest price 
hand auctioneer receives qn bits round channel ca bps 
take account period time required round receiving bids 
compared cost receiving bit takes enormous amount time say sec 
increases expected number rounds decreases cost round increases 
result approximation estimate expected value rounds 
eventually total time complete auction taken auctioneer ta ta qn logk ca total time spend bidder cb tb qm logk cb differentiating wehave dk ca nq lca log nq log log simplified lca qn log log dividing factor satisfying equation minimizes total expected time complete auction 
show particular behavior tb provided parameters ca mbps cb kbps bits constants time delay auctioneer greater bidder bottleneck auctioneers 
applying equation see ta minimized means expected time complete auction minutes 
partial attempt address intersecting questions computational performance economic efficiency privacy electronic auctions 
importance area needed 
approach time auctioneer bidders time run auction example section narrow discussed particular approach electronic auctions attempted reasonable performance estimates model 
applicability auctions real time systems remains demonstrated hope study sheds light tradeoffs particular tie breaking strategies
