related general problems information overload low signal noise ratio received considerable attention research literature 
term information filtering generically refer finding desired information filtering eliminating undesirable filtering related appears labels information retrieval selective dissemination information 
addition research agents user modeling mediators explored semi autonomous computer programs perform information filtering behalf user 
malone describe categories filtering techniques cognitive social economic information sources techniques draw order predict user reaction article 
categories provide useful road map literature 
cognitive content filtering techniques select documents text 
example kill files string search features provided news clients perform content filtering 
division netnews newsgroups primitive example reader restricts attention articles particular text string newsgroup field 
content filtering techniques potentially 
profile texts include kill complex collection character strings 
example strings combined boolean operators 
alternatively profile consist weight vectors weights expressing relative importance set terms 
content filtering techniques update profiles automatically feedback user likes articles current profile selects 
information retrieval research refers process relevance feedback 
techniques updating draw bayesian probability genetic algorithms machine learning techniques 
social filtering techniques select articles relationships people subjective judgments 
placing author name kill file crude example 
sophisticated techniques filter articles people previously authored papers objectionable person 
collaborative filtering subjective evaluations readers promising form social filtering 
human readers share computers difficulties synonymy polysemy context judging relevance text 
people judge texts dimensions quality authoritativeness 
moderated newsgroup employs primitive form collaborative filtering choosing articles potential readers evaluations single person moderator 
tapestry system sophisticated subjective evaluations 
designed specifically netnews allows filtering incoming information streams including netnews 
people post evaluations just single moderator readers choose evaluators pay attention 
evaluations contain text just binary accept reject recommendations 
filters combine content criteria subjective evaluations 
example reader request articles containing word cscw joe evaluated evaluation contains word excellent 
similar spirit tapestry extends ways

social implications collaborative filtering may introduce social changes rapidly evolving netnews community 
example utility moderated newsgroups may decline 
new social patterns develop encourage socially beneficial behaviors reviewing articles received low ratings 
grouplens effective creating peer groups shared interests peer groups global village fracture tribes 
changes netnews behaviors grouplens potential change netnews know 
thing quality articles individual users choose read increase 
significantly users rely grouplens total number low quality articles usenet may decrease significantly 
people read articles incentive post decrease 
grouplens may supplant supplement established netnews behaviors 
moderated newsgroups grouplens may reduce need moderated newsgroups 
advantages grouplens existing approach moderators groups people individuals user rely different moderator having single moderator entire group 
newsgroups choose moderator grouplens 
moderator newsgroup initial pass article submissions 
peer ratings allow filtering 
newsgroup splits currently newsgroups start broad topics split narrower topics traffic increases 
example newsgroup rec sport football eventually split subgroups australian canadian pro college fantasy misc team nfl 
splits form content filtering initiated managed users 
grouplens users may find splits important cases undesirable 
course time users find reading subset newsgroup interested correlate peer group similar interests 
splits interest groups users appear naturally additional user administrative effort 
allowing splits happen grouplens explicit content filtering allows cross general interest articles 
instance interesting articles posted bills fans upcoming football game reach fans grouplens articles posted specialized newsgroup rec sport football bills 
kill files kill files content filtering mechanism implemented news clients 
users strongly dislike particular subjects particular authors kill files find mechanism complicated cumbersome 
grouplens easier means 
user peer group give articles low ratings users read 
incentives individuals put additional effort albeit modest amount providing ratings grouplens 
ratings provide benefit users select interesting articles 
way street producer consumer ratings 
reads rates article incentive provide honest ratings dishonest ratings cause bbb poor predictions user 
hand incentive rate articles 
contrary incentive wait ratings read rate article oneself 
certain amount altruism guilt may cause people share rating fewer socially optimal number ratings produced 
person minnesota pilot test included high volume newsgroup rec arts movies 
volume articles high participant unwilling read quarter share total daily volume 
newsgroup quickly dropped test 
may larger user population generate ratings high volume list rec arts movies harder draw share mentality collaborating larger groups people 
subtle incentive problems arise 
example asymmetry effects positive negative ratings 
readers rate article highly read article give lower ratings 
hand ratings article negative rated highly may look initial negative rating 
avoid may necessary provide external incentives people read rate articles initially low ratings 
external incentives money fame simply access ratings contribute share ratings denied access better bit bureau predictions 
global villages newsgroups newspapers local television shows provide shared history community readers 
grouplens users may choose read articles small group share common interests 
time lead fracture global village small tribes forming virtual community isolated 
kind fracture inevitable desirable user keep overwhelming volume news produced day 
question subgroups closed 
argument permeability groups form short time 
users participate subgroups providing mechanism best ideas cross boundaries interest groups 
shared evaluations useful sorts activities 
ask friends colleagues professional reviewers opinions books movies journal articles cars schools neighborhoods 
clearly form shared evaluations help filtering electronic information streams netnews 
clear exactly form evaluations take collected disseminated selecting articles read 
grouplens promising approach 
single number gives composite rating article dimensions relevant particular reader 
modified news reading clients enable easy entry numeric ratings 
modified way clients display subject lines include predicted scores ratings 
naturally differences opinion readers particular articles due varying interests quality assessments 
accommodate differences opinion readers place equal trust particular evaluators 
algorithms implemented automatically determine weight place evaluation degree correlation past opinions reader evaluator 
beneficial side effects readers need know initially evaluations trust evaluators opinions trusted evaluators choose remain anonymous 
grouplens architecture allows new users connect new rating servers come line global coordination
