understand said seek clarification try things 
people noticing conversation gone result party misunderstanding figuring exact nature problem saying right thing recover error 
unreasonable expect computers understand language perfectly 
expect computers flexibility deal consequences imperfection 
people ability recognize problems understanding correct 
understanding misunderstanding participants dialogue bring different beliefs goals 
differences lead different assumptions actions construct different interpretations discourse objects produce utterances specific vague interpret intended 
may lead understanding misunderstanding 
understanding mean participant failure find complete interpretation utterance 
mean finding interpretation utterance mean finding interpretation able choose alternatives 
important aspect understanding participant aware happened 
contrast participant aware initially misunderstanding occurred 
misunderstanding participant obtains interpretation believes complete correct speaker intended obtain 
possible misunderstanding remain unnoticed conversation participants continue talk cross purposes 
alternatively conversation break leading participant misunderstanding confused misconception 
misconception error prior knowledge participant 
mccoy yeh pollack studied problem participant conversation determine misconceptions order correct 
determine misunderstanding occurred 
useful divide misunderstanding types self misunderstandings detected participant participant detected 
self misunderstandings arise participant finds incorporate utterance discourse consistently interprets earlier utterances differently 
misunderstandings occur participant recognizes acts interpreted differently utterance expected response 
participant attempt change interpretation 
example restate message explicitly tell misunderstood cf order avoid social awkwardness 
research considered misunderstanding understanding trying somewhat different approach 
understanding referent referring collaboration linguistic task referring object idea involve collaboration speaker hearer 
speaker goal having hearer identify object speaker mind 
speaker attempts achieve goal constructing description object thinks enable hearer identify 
speaker hearer inevitably somewhat different beliefs world hearer able identify object description understand 
cases speaker hearer collaborate making new referring expression accomplishes 
important series experiments clark colleagues especially wilkes gibbs shown conversants engage kind negotiation order understand wishes 
fundamental experiment clark wilkes pairs subjects copy set hard describe figures 
subjects task arrange sets order conversation see set 
subjects obliged construct descriptions hoped interpret correctly example looks angel stick 
clark wilkes gibbs typically participant trying describe pattern initial referring expression 
participant pass judgment accepting rejecting postponing decision 
rejected decision postponed participant referring expression 
take form expanding expression adding qualifications replacing original expression new expression 
referring expression resulted judged process continued referring expression acceptable participants current purposes
