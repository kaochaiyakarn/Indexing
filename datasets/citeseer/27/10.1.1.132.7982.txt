individuals organize virtual systems differently 
frequently directories prospero representing archie database developed mcgill university 
directory includes subdirectories organizing files components file names

subdirectories exist individually axe stead created referenced querying archie database

provide benefits prospero users installed systems steve australian academic research network archive working group added prospero support ftp servers 
making files available physical file system modified ftp server files available virtual file system 
retrieval request received ftp server locates file file systems workshop prospero checks see copy file available locally 
prospero check modified time authoritative copy ftp server checks local copy current

related allowing users construct view system selecting components available network goal shared plan 
key differences plan addresses problems combining components finding 
system components plan global names 
plan address problem users identify components want include system view 
prospero concerned primarily mechanisms needed organize identify components interest relies system provided access methods 
functionality filters prospero similar domain switching portal mechanism universal directory service 
portal call separate name server may non standard implementation enabling resolve names manner different standard name server 
portal implemented separate server filter executed name resolver 
result resolving name portal function remaining components name result affected point portal attached 
means new portal new name server run point attachment 
portal mechanism closer integrate prospero archie filters 
attribute naming supported profile semantic file system provides alternative mechanism finding information interest 
attribute naming database maintained object attributes user specifies known attributes object name 
semantic file system result directory listing objects matching specified attributes 
profile attributes specified uniquely identify object result object 
attribute naming scale directory information distributed mul tiple servers 
way direct query right server queries sent servers operation doesn scale 
profile restricts set servers queried relies cross direct queries servers included original set doing negates advantages attribute systems necessary cross place query 
attribute naming prospero powerful 
databases maintained systems accessed filters perform desired pre post processing 
features virtual system model impose structure directs queries appropriate servers 
combination attribute naming similar multi structured naming 
alternative approach finding objects large systems schwartz proposes resource discovery agents accept queries users information provided user find objects user interested 
schwartz design information needed direct query appropriate agent evolves time
