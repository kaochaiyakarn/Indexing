evaluation methodology 
evaluate efficiency profitability different pricing mechanisms follow 
randomly place houses region size wireless link houses distance wireless communication range cr 
neighborhood layout finding optimal placement smallest number serve houses np hard problem means polynomial algorithm optimizes itap locations np 
achieve efficiency low computational cost determine location greedy algorithm 
iteration compute houses served place itap possible locations select results largest number served houses 
iteration pick conjunction chosen itap results largest number served houses 
iterate houses served 
consider house served itap hc hops away itap hc input parameter specifying maximum allowed hop count number links house traverses reaching itap 
placing house uses closest itap terms number hop count access internet 
exact route house uses itap shortest hop count dijkstra algorithm 
motivation limiting hop count house itap routing traffic path smallest hop count wireless network throughput tends decrease fast increasing hop count 
path decide real time price pit router uses traffic sent 
router chooses price maximizes aggregate profit routing traffic children 
argmax pit pit children pit

reduction rate smaller number maximal allowed hop count larger 
expect increasing maximal allowed hop count decreases number required reduce installation cost
