apart promising languages situation calculus modal languages kripke prior stayed far removed 
think partly due historical reasons 
prior writing notoriously difficult 
secondly late order modal logic hot topic debate centered philosophical problems 
time hardly saw useful language doing knowledge representation mccarthy hayes notable exceptions 
fact prior exception saw modal logic general dynamic theory information 
important reason inadequate expressive power available modal languages purposes mccarthy hayes mind 
late situation changed considerably 
foremost know actions naturally represented dynamic logic branch modal logic 
secondly nowadays modal logic respectable member field knowledge representation name description logic 
saw emergence branch modal logic called hybrid logic took reinvented prior ideas 
seemingly unaware prior argue names states dynamic logic 
hybrid logic adds modal logic explicit states mechanism bind variables states modal logical term situation holds operator allowing express formula holds state named purpose introduce hybrid logic artificial intelligence community

situation calculus hybrid logic steps section argue hybrid logic suited formalism speak situations fluents 
reviewing key examples reformulate hybrid logic :10.1.1.85.5082
hybrid language introduced informally step step 
rigorous formal definition resulting quantified hybrid logic appendix 
mccarthy hayes willing suppress situation argument formulas just order modal logic 
shows example formulas section :10.1.1.85.5082
find unnatural going natural language practice add extra argument predicate symbol situation 
example john loves mary expressed love refers situation 
reason introduce abbreviations extra argument suppressed 
write quotes syntactical status formulas clear 
cases need refer situations explicitly 
note similarity prior nominals situation variables analogous time instants calculi world states prior calls calculi 
show modern treatment prior ideas known name hybrid logic provides exactly linguistic elements mccarthy hayes searching 
important semantic constructs situation calculus situation fluent 
situation complete state universe instant time 
fluent function domain set situations 
propositional fluents fluents range set truth values true false 
situational fluents range set situations 
start considering propositional fluents 
key idea situation calculus meaning expression fluent 
equate situations possible worlds kripke semantics suggestion sentences quantified modal logic express propositional fluents 
example meaning sentence john walks traditionally set possible worlds sentence john walks true 
set course uniquely determines propositional fluent 
key idea modal logic order modal logical sentence expresses propositional fluent 
referring explicitly situations 
fact traditional modal logic refer situations traditionally called worlds models 
quantified hybrid logic sentence expresses propositional fluent 
addition refer situations indicate formula holds certain situation 
names situations holds operator 
mccarthy hayes need expressive power quantified modal logic offer 
want able express situation john walks holds 
possible quantified modal logic contains machinery refer possible worlds 
prior ideas modern treatment form hybrid logic come action 
moment add second sort variables called nominals language order logic 
nominal formula nominals freely combined form new formulas 
addition nominal formula pronounce formula 
function nominals name situations 
meaning nominal atomic formula hybrid logic model propositional fluent true unique situation named model 
adds holds operator order logic states formula holds situation named meaning constant propositional fluent sends situation true holds situation named situation false 
holds operator plays important role number knowledge representation formalisms instance allen events intervals kowalski event calculus 
consider example 
mccarthy hayes want assert situation person place raining place expressed raining 
satisfied notation give possible equivalent notations raining raining 
expressible different formulas lambda abstraction 
fluent raining simply expressed raining 
formulas expressed raining literal translation statement natural language 
original formulation expressed distributing conjunction sat 
theories definitions 
second reason mccarthy hayes want explicit situations 
express laws nature definitions information supposed true situations universally quantify situations 
give example kind transitivity predicate expresses location situation 
second statement situation argument suppressed 
meant implicitly quantify situations 
modal terminology 
functions universal modality 
description logic special status statements supposed true situations 
placed called box theory box 
natural place collect definitions laws hold universally 
adopt box machinery express simply putting sentence box 
note literally formulation preferred unappealing empty quantifier replaced box :10.1.1.85.5082
prior temporal operators 
section prior temporal operator introduced situation calculus :10.1.1.85.5082
clear formalism suited explicit abstraction simple causality assertion 
means situation followed unspecified time situation satisfies fluent 
describe temporal aspect situations mccarthy hayes postulate function time set situations set time points 
set comes usual linear earlier ordering 
formalization assertion person rain get wet 
raining outside wet 
mccarthy hayes quickly suppress explicit mention situations yielding raining outside wet 
delete empty quantifier 
put result box get formalization temporal 
temporal prior temporal operators added language formula formulas 
meaning evaluated locally situation true situation exists situation time time true meaning defined similarly true situation exists situation true 
expresses thing respect past 
actions

related approach taken levesque pirri reiter cf 
reiter book 
treat actions dynamic logic introduce modality action :10.1.1.12.8714
mccarthy hayes deal actions situational fluent result :10.1.1.85.5082
person action situation 
value result situation results carries starting action terminate result considered undefined 
note result function set situations range 
functions handle deterministic actions 
drawback representation partial functions 
unclear truth value formula receive arguments undefined 
reiter similar problems lead ghost situations dynamic logic offers solution problems pays price explicit situations possible language 
see needed elegantly done hybrid logic 
simplify matters just consider actions actor implicit
