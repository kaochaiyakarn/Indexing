hierarchies emphasize different relationships

information subsumption hierarchy prevented happening 
way create completely merged hierarchy 
topic hierarchies locate relevant documents uses may 
way utilize hierarchies exposed relationships specific information tasks characterizing document set necessary 
hierarchies provide convenient way browse document collection 
automatically generating topic hierarchy brings light information specific domain document set opposed manually generated hierarchy needs suit users general 
methods explored perform better homogeneous document sets clustering provides alternative ranked list allows hierarchies instances query 
evaluation metrics provide way evaluation hierarchies requiring user input formed hierarchies created enabling user study yield ambiguous results 
results show subsumption lexical relations different exposing relations 
strength subsumption lies separating documents small groups lexical hierarchies better job including documents hierarchy 
research provides foundation needed continue developing hierarchies best allow users locate relevant documents
