open problems directions 
intermediate form intermediate forms varying degrees complexity suitable different mining purposes 
fine grain domain specific knowledge discovery task necessary perform semantic analysis derive sufficiently rich representation capture relationship objects concepts described documents 
semantic analysis methods computationally expensive operate order words second 
remains challenge see semantic analysis efficient scalable large text corpora 

multilingual text refining data mining largely language independent text mining involves significant language component 
essential develop text refining algorithms process multilingual text documents produce language independent intermediate forms 
text mining tools focus processing english documents mining documents languages allows access previously information offers new host opportunities 

domain knowledge integration domain knowledge catered current text mining tools play important role text mining 
specifically domain knowledge early text refining stage 
interesting explore take advantage domain information improve parsing efficiency derive compact intermediate form 
domain knowledge play part knowledge distillation 
classification predictive modeling task domain knowledge helps improve learning mining efficiency quality learned model mined knowledge 
interesting explore user knowledge initialize knowledge structure discovered knowledge interpretable 

personalized autonomous mining current text mining products applications tools designed trained knowledge specialists 
text mining tools part knowledge management systems readily usable technical users management executives 
efforts developing systems interpret natural language queries automatically perform appropriate mining operations 
text mining tools appear form intelligent personal assistants 
agent paradigm personal miner learn user profile conduct text mining operations automatically forward information requiring explicit request user
