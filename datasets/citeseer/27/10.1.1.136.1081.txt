statement consistently refers wife suggesting distance couple 
trained interrogator ask man relationship wife 
says inseparable interrogator reason suspicious ask follow question 
linguistic style may useful hands trained expert knows look language reveal inconsistencies see 
limitations research deserve attention 
particular model limited english language possibly american english 
argument studies liars truth tellers language predictably different ways 
obvious differences vocabulary languages different patterns language 
linguistic markers may identify deception languages 
example number romance languages require expressed noun pronoun part verb 
spanish person may introduce saying bob am bob pronoun yo meaning true latin instances people lying latin decline 
different patterns linguistic markers deception identified study especially person pronouns may generalize languages 
possible deception languages characterized changes person singular verbs lower rate iam 
suggest research linguistic markers deception languages proceed way study creating empirically derived linguistic profile validating profile independent sample
