incorrect identifications involved language abbreviation auto representing automatic transmission 
typographical mistakes led lower recall

provided framework converting data rich unstructured documents structured documents 
addition implemented procedures framework demonstrated framework implemented procedures achieve results 
remains done 
particular tasks lie ahead improve fine tune implemented procedures add front page processors diversify back display generators 
things fine tune approach 
example ontological descriptions richer 
richer semantics small subset language 
additional modeling constructs include ary relationship sets generalization specialization hierarchies aggregation declared view generation predicate constraints computation constraints 
corresponding model equivalent textual components defined parsers built 
procedures exist synthesizing schemas flat schemas nested schemas 
begun explore impact richer ontological descriptions applying framework extract genealogical information 
preliminary results indicate obtain recall precision ratios similar car ads job listings richer application domain genealogy 
improve schema generation data population 
regular expressions information need generate better types integer float money date time 
need convert values obtained types 
currently implemented strings obtain comparisons difficult 
directly compare equality 
furthermore ordering constants multiple formats direct greater comparisons meaningless 
useful allow replacement constants descriptive phrases example convert pl power locks 
improve fine tune heuristics 
finding testing better heuristics definitely possible deserves attention 
representing declaratively processing different strategies possible investigated 
techniques research areas 
examples include natural language processing improve semantic understanding currently approach purely syntactic advantage faster process constraint programming determining candidate constant values fall equational constraints birth date precede death date theory evidence weighting results different competing heuristics decide path choose 
develop tools libraries ontology specification 
step process human resource intensive specification application ontology 
complex step programming requires expert 
graphical tools editing ontology seeing effects changes sample set documents helpful reducing burden regular expression generation 
begun develop graphical tools java 
provide pre built libraries common ontology types currency date time phone mail urls domains 
front page processors needed prepare documents 
case studies searched web documents interest saved html pages file identified record boundaries html text processed files insert record separators remove html markers 
automated 
turned able insert record separators remove html markers just minutes effort 
currently working nontrivial task automatically separating records 
interestingly ontology help automatically recognize record boundaries 
example discover key constants repeating infer crossed record boundary 
working refining approach boundary recognition 
diversification back display generators broaden range usability 
implementation generate populated relational database sql select statements retrieval
