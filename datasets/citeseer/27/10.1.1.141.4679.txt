describe magpie tool supporting interpretation web pages 
magpie acts complementary knowledge source reader call quickly gain access background knowledge relevant web resource 
magpie follows different approach aforementioned annotation technology automatically associates semantic layer web resource relying manual annotations 
process relies availability ontology explicit declaratively specified representation domain discourse 
ontologies cornerstone emerging semantic web provide conceptual interoperability needed allow semantic agents sense information web collaborate semantically aware agents 
magpie uses ontologies similar way possible magpie associate meaning items information web page basis identified meaning invoke relevant services offer user appropriate functionalities 
magpie mediated association ontology web resource essentially provides interpretative viewpoint context resource question 
overwhelming majority web pages created specific context 
example personal home page member knowledge media institute normally created context person affiliation organizational role 
course readers familiar context 
scenario magpie especially advantageous context explicit reader context specific functionalities provided 
naturally different readers differing levels familiarity information shown web page relevant background domain require different level sensemaking support 
semantic layer magpie consequently designed specific type user mind 
seminal study users browse web tauscher greenberg statistics types actions users typically carry pages visited revisits user actions related navigation navigation actions back button navigation actions history mechanism fairly obvious statistics web users need support capturing seen previously 
current history mechanisms back button aside little help

magpie offers trigger services dependent semantic log 
type magpie service intended replace traditional links designed auxiliary source knowledge available user fingertips 
years number tools emerged support annotation web pages 
classic example amaya html editor implements annotea infrastructure 
annotea facilitates rdf mark web documents created 
words authors viewers may add various meta statements document separate document accessible collaborating teams centralized annotation server 
annotation sense centres attaching additional information chunk content arbitrary web page 
feature annotea powerful tool joint authoring documents small group collaborating agents share common goal 
feature may difficult facilitate similar form annotation sharing open user communities 
cases guarantee freely articulated annotation convey meaning different users 
difference annotea framework compared magpie approach source annotations 
annotea assumes author human willing invest additional effort making page semantically richer 
magpie hand liberal assumes reader subscribes particular domain ontology provide relevant background knowledge 
may argued ontology creation takes effort simple document annotation 
information available www hyphen info true ontology domain model shared viewpoint different purposes solely annotation single document 
effort spent designing shared ontology may greater short term longer term cost effective way recording shared point view 
similar approach annotating formally structured documents research projects 
example cedar toolkit similar strategy rich web publishing construction organizational memories shared organizational ontology 
cream ont mat tool similar mnm described section integrates ontologies information extraction technologies :10.1.1.21.3877
mnm amilcare provides information extraction support ontologies represented daml oil 
annotations understood framework close advocated 
basically ontological instance attribute relation known particular ontology may serve annotation 
key feature ont mat discourse representations structure relatively flat output amilcare chosen ontology facilitating ontology population process 
cream research team voice important feature ontology annotation document enrichment 
annotating tool aware existing recognized entities relationships harm done redundancies multiple definitions 
cream annotation inference resembles trigger semantic services produced data driven reasoning process

shoe project proposed extension html allow specification ontological information common html documents 
addition inclusion semantically rich ontological knowledge shoe invested significant effort making inclusions re usable understandable web 
editor developed support page annotation process 
tools mentioned previous paragraphs magpie framework shoe relies offline annotation mark web documents 
accomplished enriched documents published web dedicated tools may enriched contextual knowledge expos web crawler 

reducing information overload caused growing web cited premise supporting retrieval relevant documents 
finding relevant documents half story 
interpreting returned document involves reader understanding surrounding context document created 
order gain full understanding document reader require knowledge specific terms mentioned implicit relationships contained document document external knowledge sources 
magpie addresses issue capturing context ontology enrich web documents semantic layer 
semantic services expose relevant segments ontology user needs 
described section certain design criteria critical semantic layering useful usable 
desired mag pie users able browse web standard way negligible differences user experience 
magpie achieve works standard web browsers standard mark languages presents web pages altering layout appearance involves small time overhead magpie proxy server takes second parse relatively large web pages 
key set principles underlying design magpie user able control extent semantic browsing comes fore 
magpie toolbar enables terms visible ontological category 
magpie framework enables arbitrary semantic actions triggered patterns items semantic log 
trigger services allow certain types tasks delegated 
simple trigger services shown scenario enable semantically designated types entities collected inspection 
complex trigger services implemented easily magpie framework 
example magpie proxy option automatically parse web pages linked current page 
allows reconnaissance services set alert user interesting neighbouring page identified 
mentioned magpie addresses issues tauscher greenberg study web pages browsed 
users need better support managing histories visited web pages

magpie previous pages semantic query types entities page
