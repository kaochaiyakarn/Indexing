debate centered nature social dilemmas 
environmental issues trade wars negotiations countries social interactions scenarios involved players may choose altruistic cooperative action alternative selfish behaviour 
cases appears selfish action beneficial rational choice take encounter time time people groups choosing apparently non rational altruistic option 
examples include people investing time money effort environmental issues charity organisations 
thomas hobbes pessimistic explanation cooperation maintained group interacting agents argued prior existence governments nature dominated selfish agents resulting life solitary poor nasty short 
believed controlling authority cooperation impossible 
olson agreed classical coercion selective incentives necessary achieve cooperation
