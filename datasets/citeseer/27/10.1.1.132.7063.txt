fitness health awareness motivation numerous studies theories sports science health literature explored motivate people increase level activity terms moderate activity day specifically targeted exercise 
example social cognitive theory predicts exercise level individual internal values need social external values stages change 
social cognitive theory focuses increasing individual self efficacy relation keeping fit 
theory studies show intrinsic motivation enjoyment feeling exercise extrinsic motivation external pressures immediate rewards increase likelihood person stick routine 
experiments example show personal services successful promoting increased physical activity middle aged elderly compared control group 
research addressed social aspects sharing activity information motivate people active light competition occurs people increase activity level 
similarly people receive tailored information personally relevant stimulate change adding self efficacy outcome expectancy 
behavior change difficult promote health researchers point unique combination internal external influences complicated trace 
critique physical activity literature example distinguish individual level values age social class health status social level values family school community 
social cognitive theory addresses aspects community focuses internal values main motivator increase individuals level exercise 
social factors poverty neighborhood highly influence levels exercise individual reasonable conclude exercise affected behavior individual surrounding group alongside individual values 
goals project focus social communal aspects exercise pressure surrounding community great motivational factor underestimated relation intrinsic motivational factors 
technologies numerous activity measuring technologies developed commonly heart rate monitors 
typically heart rate monitors medical purposes gym measurement general fitness level wrist worn monitors common making possible outside 
tool small device measures stride wearer takes 
research indicates just presence motivate people active sharing information small group friends satisfying motivating participants compared control group 
new commercial technology area measures array values temperature difference skin air steps acceleration order estimate wearer burning 
shown reliably controlled tests measuring burnt accuracy various tests showed difficulty determining actual context wearer 
disadvantage worn upper arm hours day easily collide everyday clothing particular women tend wear tighter clothes men 
alternatively applications relied gps data 
measures speed distance altitude calculates number burnt basis 
gps applications rely constant view satellites usually making inefficient satellite shadows appear frequently device naturally indoor 
experimental technologies multimodal sensors infer patterns behavior developed intel research seattle 
sensor board uses data audio axis acceleration barometric pressure temperature humidity compass heading light level 
data enables sensing box distinguish types activity sitting walking jogging riding bicycle 
small box containing sensor board equipped bluetooth wireless networking worn user body 
sensor board specially built commercially available 
problems systems described applicability daily life 
worn person body times preferably hip height similar arm worn heart rate monitor needs tight chest 
body attachment intrusive everyday activities making usable people want device everyday 
intrusive activity measuring technologies weakness measures strides intensity strides 
tremendous effect actual level activity individual body uses different force example walk uphill straight slowly versus fast 
aims project design develop new type activity tracking suitable daily life ones 
preciseness important measurements meant provide fitness awareness individuals medical measurements users understanding important numerical accuracies 
methodological considerations combining theories social science particular sports medicine related issues methodologies technology design aiming design implement trial innovative fitness technologies 
project interdisciplinary stance relating research social technical theories tradition human computer interaction ethnographic methods pre design evaluation studies gain better knowledge technology utilized motivate fitness 
methods include qualitative inquiry analysis important factors relation example active people motivation experience fitness health 
pre design study conducted reveals concerns motivations people relation specific exercise 

pre design study exercise study depth interviews respondents selected purposive sampling allowing select information rich cases 
participants active active getting specific exercise times week 
age range males females 
study revealed issues relation themes participants got exercise active motivated active de motivating 
doing types exercise characteristics participants got exercise combination different types cardiovascular exercise gym swimming running park climbing hiking 
exercised times week doing various things exercise gym year old male started exercising months earlier year old female mainly went exercise classes 
despite quite active said feel got exercise increase level everyday activity 
motivations characteristics highly active participants exercised people friends acquaintances 
participants buddies worked times 
said motivated 
female participant age go running woman running fast 
knew get exercise running motivated 
factor friendly competition 
male participant age mainly cycle injury go gym friend compete stationary cycle 
difficult stay motivated gym 
female interviewee age gym boring took spinning classes social prefer exercising people 
gives motivation fun 
gym boring know think people gym just find dull 
realized motivate relied specific exercise classes 
half participants brought music players gym felt got motivated beat music 
running outside hand runners occasionally bring music player 
performance related motivations wanting look run able play football mentioned 
de motivations despite participants highly active people doing different types activities problems motivating 
obstacles participants said skipped just feel going consequently felt bad injuries leading certain types activity restricted making exercise sessions motivating 
gym issues de motivation 
issue raised relation gym machinery particular treadmill positioned front full length mirror 
year old male interviewee treadmill boring machines 
associated fact treadmill placed front mirror majority time just looking reflection 
control panels gym machinery critique participant age controls stationary bike consequently exercise 
covered towel watch progress exercise closely 
problems cardiovascular gym exercise activities taken outdoor practice running cycling placed uniform sterile gym environment 
introduced stimuli music tv ineffective detrimental prove liking 
majority participants motivated social factors friendly competition working pairs groups added experience 
case people motivated social factors sharing experiences important 
research focusing social aspects exercise promoting exercise way social systems 

activity tracker developed considering findings study 
important motivate people social technologies everyday basis 
pointed people get recommended minutes moderate activity day just minimal increase moderate activity improves health 
designed developed activity tracking sharing device 
application uses fluctuation gsm signals neighboring cell information determine pattern mobile phone moving 
training user area system accurately track user mobility 
train system user indicates activity performed starting new walking running bicycling driving 
distinguish walking moderate intensity walking driving car bus train 
system depends movement fluctuation cell id detect stationary movement walking treadmill 
technical details testing accuracy described 
application theory adapted run mobile phone current version developed gsm phones windows operating system 
phone manufacturers limit access cell data application run certain phone sp 
contrast merely tell wearer steps taken time period measure intensity movement 
body tracking devices ones mentioned worn body skin application simply add part user mobile phone 
user continuously view current activity status see previous week graph shown 
data continuously uploaded gprs central server available specified friends user 
user compare amount activity friends daily weekly basis 
see function 
user previous week comparison friends activity 
tested week groups friends people group study investigated experience application applicability real world 
data collected system log showing activity users looked comparing friends 
participants filled diary night interviewed experiences 
participants positive motivating increase activity 
participants necessarily increase activity week aware activity levels 
participant example said surprised lazy fact wanted 
study analyzed presently reported publication
