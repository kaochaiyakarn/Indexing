offer general comments book 
innovative technique authors pose exercise problems chapter interesting topics vital derived fairly easily tools chapter 
expands coverage material making book voluminous 
example exercises chapter useful theorem 
example clark theorem states primal dual problems feasible feasible regions unbounded 
clearly exercises challenging homework problems ambitious teacher 
book authors serious efforts give geometric intuitive explanations various algebraic concepts widely successful effort 
example witnessed chapter authors provide visualization tool helps picture dual feasible bases solutions primal space 
explanations insights things math programmers grasp course research careers 
authors quest completeness presentation easily noticed places text appreciable 
times takes tone research places material feels dense mainly long list topics covered writing style pleasant point 
chapter wise organization nearly ideal arrangement sections certain chapters may individual instructor suit teaching style 
outstanding textbook presents linear optimization truly modern todate light 
reading book sufficient appreciate tremendous amount quality effort authors put writing strongly recommend teachers researchers practitioners mathematical programming
