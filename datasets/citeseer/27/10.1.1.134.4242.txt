specific application support elderly denying population aging 
baby boom approaches late middle age clear maturing mass humanity impact country financially emotionally 
question concerns care population lives years longer preceding generation 
part question involves lives ages 
assisting person remain familiar surroundings age improves quality life increases length life 
increased mobility stemming industrial revolution forever changed american society 
people longer live community lives 
aging parents longer live close adult children 
current practice elderly people assistive living centers expensive unsatisfactory experience involved 
people get older find difficult live forced move homes require type constant physical assistance 
done provide peace mind family members 
moving form assisted living provides security frequent monitoring availability medical assistance event emergency 
people able keep peace mind living homes forced away familiarity friends accustomed 
goal project design system provides type monitoring currently supported assisted living center individuals demand frequent medical help services provided person 
preliminary investigations identified areas interface design sensing technology research 
want support social connections elder parents adult children promoting peace mind family members 
persistent connections convey activity respective homes trends time 
second hope support everyday cognition augmenting aspects memory decline age planning capabilities elder residents 
third plan sense identify potential crisis situations appropriate outside services contacted needed 
evaluation social issues explained earlier reason building aware home independent living areas allow region home occupied times
