gives brief overview djvu technique described details 
sections show djvu highly efficient foreground background representation image especially internet applications require extremely high compression ratio progressive decoding

djvu compression method basic idea djvu separate text backgrounds pictures different techniques compress components 
traditional methods designed compress natural images edges jpeg compress black white document images entirely composed sharp edges ccitt 
djvu technique improves combines best approaches 
foreground background separation algorithm generates encodes images separately original image reconstructed background image foreground image mask image 
color images generally dpi high resolution bi level image dpi 
pixel decoded image constructed follows corresponding pixel mask image output pixel takes value corresponding pixel appropriately background image 
mask pixel pixel color chosen color connected component taken foreground image 
foreground background representation key element mrc standard 
mask image encoded bi level image compression algorithm 
bi level image compression algorithm djvu encode mask dubbed jb 
variation proposal upcoming fax standard 
key compression method method making information previously encountered characters marks risking character substitution errors inherent ocr 
marks clustered hierarchically 
marks compressed coded directly arithmetic coding similar standard 
marks compressed coded indirectly previously coded marks statistical model arithmetic coding 
previously coded mark help coding mark may coded directly indirectly 
ways achieve clustering conditional encoding marks algorithm currently called soft pattern matching 
background image encoded method suitable continuous tone images 
djvu uses progressive wavelet compression algorithm called iw purpose 
addition new masking technique multiscale successive projections avoid spending bits code areas background covered foreground characters drawings

foreground background separation phase foreground background separation described 
hierarchical color clustering algorithm attempts retain information possible original image quantizing colors levels background light colors foreground dark colors 
exactly objective foreground part image high resolution necessary visual understanding 
example separation algorithm may erroneously put highly contrasted pieces photographs foreground 
variety filters applied resulting foreground image eliminate obvious mistakes 
main filter designed general possible avoids heuristics tuned hundreds different kinds documents 
goal compression problem decide foreground blob previous algorithm preferable code foreground background 
competing strategies associated models 
minimum description length mdl approach preferred strategy yields lowest coding cost sum cost coding model parameters cost coding error respect ideal model 
mdl approaches segmentation motivation obtain system parameters hand tune 
mdl principle decision avoiding time consuming minimization complex objective function 
code blob part smooth background requires background model 
code blob piece foreground sticks background requires foreground model background model mask model 
background model assumes color pixel average colors closest background pixels left 
model ignores segmentation regions masked foreground background color interpolated way minimize background reconstruction error 
foreground model assumes color blob uniform 
models noise estimated pixel values gaussian laplacian 
type noise identical covariances preferable allow small perturbations dithering effects cancel comparing models 
remain coded boundaries mask model tends favor horizontal vertical boundaries 
summary main filter background model allows slow drift color foreground model assumes color constant connected component
