extracting data continuing weather example assume application needs process weather data temperature forecast city 
information sources want web site called reports daily weather data major cities world 
site queried directly application forecast helsinki may extract contents weather table underlying html page displayed 
extraction process configurable extraction program parses html page specification file shown 
specification file consists sequence commands defining extraction step 
command form variables source pattern source specifies input text considered pattern tells find text interest source variables extractor variables hold extracted results 
text variables input subsequent commands 
variable contains extracted url specify url followed linked page input 
command executed subset variables hold data interest 
describe contents variables packaged oem object 
line numbers shown left hand side figures part content added simplify discussion 
advances databases information systems section html source file semistructured data tsimmis experience advances databases information systems sample extractor specification file semistructured data tsimmis experience looking see list commands placed outermost brackets command delimited brackets 
extraction process example performed commands 
initial command lines fetches contents source file url line variable called root 
character line means case contents entire file extracted 
file fetched contents read root extractor filter unwanted data html markup commands extra text remaining commands 
second command lines specifies result applying pattern line source variable root stored new variable called temperature 
pattern interpreted follows discard occurrence token ri means discard second table definition save data stored ri means save 
tokens navigational help identify correct ri token way specifying numbered occurrence token discard third occurrence ri 
step variable temperature contains information stored lines higher source file including subsequent token indicates temperature table 
underscore name temperature indicates temporary variable contents included resulting oem object 
third command lines instructs extractor split contents temperature variable chunks text string ht lines chunk delimiter 
note chunk represents row temperature table 
result split stored temporary variable called 
split operator applied input equally structured pieces clearly defined delimiter separating individual pieces 
thinks extractor variables lists list member result split operator viewed new list members rows temperature table 
apply pattern variable really mean applying pattern member variable apply operator lisp 
command lines extractor copies contents cell temporary array array city temp starting second cell 
integer instruction indicates copying array index starts refers second cell second integer indicates cell included counting array 
result excluded row table contains individual column headings 
note advances databases information systems extracted information oem format semistructured data tsimmis experience filtered unwanted row second command specifying additional ri condition line 
final command lines extracts individual values cell city temp array assigns variables listed line country url city 
commands executed variables hold data interest

querying semistructured data section introduce lorel query language primarily examples 
lorel extension oql full specification 
highlight features language impact novel aspects system features designed specifically handling semistructured data 
useful features lorel inherited oql standard covered 
example query introduces basic building block lorel simple path expression name followed sequence labels 
example root city location simple path expression 
semantics consists set objects reached starting root object edge advances databases information systems outlook high temp low temp todays weather current temp forecast name root city country longitude sample oem database semistructured data tsimmis experience location latitude high temp low temp current temp weather forecast objects labeled city edge objects labeled location 
range variables assigned path expressions root city specifies ranges set locations 
continuing european weather example example query retrieves locations cities located england evaluated sample oem database shown 
query lorel select root city location root city country england high level query execution engine find objects satisfy path root city location check clause satisfied 
result query shown answer complex location string southern location complex longitude float latitude float database query evaluated presents number irregularities discussed earlier 
guiding principle lorel write query worry irregularities know precise structure objects structure location objects bother precise types 
query yield run time error location object string value complex country objects single valued set valued absent cities 
query succeed matter actual structure database return appropriate answer 
course query written obvious knowledge graph laid database 
sec 
discuss user discover structure database 
value comparisons objects coerced comparable types 
objects type attempts coerce values comparable types applying comparison operator 
types coerced comparison return type advances databases information systems outlook high temp low temp todays weather current temp forecast name root city country longitude sample dataguide semistructured data tsimmis experience location latitude high temp low temp current temp weather forecast errors simply evaluate false 
reinforces underlying principle lorel require precise knowledge data useful dealing semistructured data 
system fact translate lorel queries oql queries evaluation 
done reasons lorel oql oql gives defined semantics queries second allows user familiar oql directly enter oql query evaluated semistructured data 
sense lorel viewed shorthand oql lorel introduces generalized path expressions oql 
generalized path expressions offer richer form declarative navigation oem databases simple path expressions 
intuitively user loosely specifies desired pattern labels database specify patterns paths match sequences labels patterns labels match sequences characters patterns atomic values 
combination forms pattern matching illustrated example query lorel select root city name root city weather outlook grep rain expression weather label pattern matches labels string weather weather weather ort weather 
path patterns symbol indicates disjunction labels symbol applied parenthesized expression left indicates label pattern optional 
complete syntax regular expressions syntactic wildcards matches path length 
grep rain specifies data value contain string rain 
operator similar unix grep command 
support loosely sql phonetic matching 
english query asking names cities forecast outlook weather contains word rain 
result query applied database looks answer complex name string innsbruck advances databases information systems name string london semistructured data tsimmis experience preprocessing simple path expressions eliminated rewriting query variables demonstrated example 
possible general path expressions require run time mechanism 
note database contains cycles general path expression may match infinite number paths data 
trying match general path expression database match cycle appears reasonable simplification practice 
conclude example illustrates advanced features language 
query illustrates subqueries constructed results 
city database satisfies bottom clause select name city current temperature current temperature satisfies clause 
query lorel select name select todays weather current temp root city country england result shown 
notice city provides binding variable satisfies clause appears answer 
particular interest fact current temp field answer 
filtered result subquery appearing select clause 
specifically object subobject labeled weather 
answer complex city complex name string london current temp integer city complex name string plymouth query formulation dataguide data explicit schema query formulation query optimization particularly challenging 
knowledge structure underlying database writing meaningful lorel query may difficult general path expressions 
may manually browse database learn structure approach unreasonable large databases 
information structure database query processor may forced perform necessary 
example consider query finds locations cities country england 
cities country subobject execution engine needlessly examine city database 
dataguide concise accurate summary structure oem database stored oem object 
possible path expression database encoded exactly dataguide dataguide path expressions exist database 
example shows dataguide sample database shown 
note atomic values usually stored leaf nodes dataguide primarily concerned structure database 
typical situations dataguide significantly smaller original database 
dataguide plays role similar metadata traditional database systems 
dataguide may queried browsed enabling user interfaces client applications examine structure database 
assuming role missing schema advances databases information systems semistructured data tsimmis experience dataguide guide query processor 
course relational object oriented systems schema explicitly created data loaded dataguides dynamically generated maintained part existing database 
formal definitions dataguides provided algorithms build incrementally maintain dataguides support annotations :10.1.1.41.3258
discussion dataguides aid query formulation practice query optimization 
browsing oem results main idea browsing tool centers need displaying semistructured objects way easy user grasp structure explore contents viewing result tsimmis query 
oem results typically irregular structure nested containing top level root object zero subobjects referred children 
subobject may nested object 
general nested objects structured trees graphs allow cycles 
anybody worked nested objects attest fact increasingly difficult understand contents nested object structure increases complexity larger number subobjects deeper level nesting 
reason built system transforms oem results web hyperlinked documents viewed www browser 
object selected viewing formatted html document 
object complex object document may include hyperlinks pointing object substructure depending user preferences 
object atomic displayed 
addition document contains link parent object selected object root entire structure 
main contribution system gives user option decide information displayed chosen information wants see 
information screen time allowing user browse complex objects may large view cafeteria style pick choose fashion 
approach browsing nested objects analogous uses table contents explore individual chapters book 
important part functionality browser focuses layout information individual pages 
process depends heavily user individual preferences data displayed paid careful attention design system flexible tailored satisfy different needs 
goal provide users choices information displayed layout screen format individual object 
initially system uses default settings maximize amount information displayed real estate window 
result improved changing values session variables control document layout level nesting screen number subobjects level default session variables control formatting complete object hierarchy 
label names refer particular object hierarchy scope session variables limited entire hierarchy specific substructure object 
customization object display may time consuming certain cases state session variables saved user basis re subsequent sessions
