address issue updating privileges dynamic environment introducing authority privilege management infrastructure 
certificates create access level permissions delegate authority agents providing mechanism creating management structures changing structures time 
semantic framework privileges certificates associated calculus encoded logic program reasoning

enables certificates prospective retrospective effects allows reason privileges consequences past 
calculus provides verification procedure determining set declaration revocation certificates certain privilege holds 
applications require decentralised management access permissions resources 
identified kinds applications management access permissions decentralised 
applications operating highly dynamic environment adaptive networks access permission updates done frequently locally partly automatically 
applications administration access permissions heavy affects core business activities 
cases security administrators fully trustworthy potential security threats deliberately unintentionally 
address issue updating access permissions organisation may define management structure 
management structure normally hierarchical structure defining authorities responsibilities research funded microsoft research cambridge uk 
distributed organisation 
ms authors identify typical roles management structure user security administrator manager owner 
authority delegated domain predefined management structure 
idea owner object full authority concerning access disposition object delegate authorities managers 
manager defines set users set objects administrative scope security administrator 
security administrator authority give permissions users predefined domain access objects domain 
notice security administrator may may part scope administration means may may able give access permissions 
current generalise idea management structure real world scenarios need creating different types management structures management structures may subject frequent changes 
fs distinguish having permission empowered organisation management structure create permission 
employ term authority place institutional power term power technical meaning context unintended connotations

separating concept authority concept permission allows represent scenarios agent authority create privilege permission authority having privilege having authority create privilege 
delegation information security literature delegation normally describes act distributing access permissions agents distributed system 
allow delegation privileges delegation authorities permissions

delegation creation new privileges delegatee receives privilege independent delegator privilege sense delegator privilege revoked necessarily mean delegatee privilege revoked
